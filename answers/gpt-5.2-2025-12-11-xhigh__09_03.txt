I cannot compute the average cycle time (hours) of the activity “Approve Invoice”, its standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval from the supplied artefacts because Artefact A contains only the column headers and explicitly has every event row and every timestamp value (including the “start_time” and “complete_time” needed to calculate each “Approve Invoice” duration) removed; without the per-occurrence durations and the number of occurrences, no mean/SD/CI can be calculated. Artefact B does not remedy this, because it provides (i) an SLA about payment within 30 days after goods receipt and (ii) a historical average elapsed time from “Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice”, which is a different interval than the cycle time of “Approve Invoice” itself and is insufficient to reconstruct the missing activity-level durations or their variance.
