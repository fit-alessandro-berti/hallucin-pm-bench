R1. **Compliant**. PO is over â‚¬10,000 and has consecutive Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval.
R2. **Violated**. Expedited = true, but Ship_Goods (March 5) happened 3 days after Finance_Approval (March 4), not within 2 days.
R3. **Violated**. Pay_Invoice (March 6) occurred before Receive_Goods (March 7).
R4. **Not Applicable**. Hazardous = false, so no Safety_Inspection required.
R5. **Compliant**. Change_Request occurred after Finance_Approval, and a new Manager_Approval was obtained before further steps.
R6. **Compliant**. Case terminates with Archive_Record.

**Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT** (violations of R2 and R3).
