Add a boundary interrupting timer event (e.g., id="Timer_Escalate") to Task_Check with a 48-hour duration. If the timer fires, connect it via a new sequence flow directly to Task_Triage (id="f10"). This ensures that if the process exceeds 48 hours from Start_Claim, it auto-escalates by interrupting Task_Check and proceeding to Triage, meeting the SLA without adding tasks.
