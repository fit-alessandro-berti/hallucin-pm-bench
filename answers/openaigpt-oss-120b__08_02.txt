**Answer 1:** Yes, T5 can fire before T3.

**Answer 2 (minimal sequence):**  

`[ T1 , T2 , T7 , T4 , T5 ]`

**Explanation (≤120 words):**  
From M₀ the only enabled transition is T1, which creates tokens in P1 and P2.  
Fire T2 to move the token from P1 to P3, then T7 to move it from P3 to P4.  
Now P4 holds a token while P2 still holds its token (T3 has not fired).  
Fire T4, which consumes the token in P4 and produces one in P5.  
At this point the pre‑conditions of T5 – a token in P2 and a token in P5 – are both satisfied, so T5 can fire before T3. No shorter firing sequence can provide a token in P5, hence the sequence above is minimal.
