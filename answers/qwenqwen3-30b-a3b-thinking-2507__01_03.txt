### **a) Summary of Every Decision Point**  
*(Each described as a single sentence, per the process flow)*  

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome**: The risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) is determined based *solely* on the Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow inputs.  
2. **Step 4 Conditional Skip**: Manual underwriting (Step 5) is skipped *only if* the risk rating is Low or Medium *and* the requested loan amount ≤ €250,000.  
3. **TriVote Decision Gate**: The loan is approved if *at least two of the three roles* (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) provide approval; otherwise, it is rejected.  

> *Note: No other conditional branches or decision points exist in the process (e.g., KYC/AML checks are outsourced and absent from the in-house flow).*
