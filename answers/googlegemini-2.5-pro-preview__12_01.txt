The fact is not accurate.

In Case 1001, the activity "Update_Inventory" (timestamp 2025-03-01 08:25:55) is immediately preceded by the activity "Inspect_Item" (timestamp 2025-03-01 08:20:10), not "Authorize_Refund". Furthermore, in Case 1001, "Authorize_Refund" (timestamp 2025-03-01 08:30:02) occurs *after* "Update_Inventory".

Similarly, in Case 1003, "Update_Inventory" (timestamp 2025-03-03 10:08:07) is immediately preceded by "Inspect_Item" (timestamp 2025-03-03 10:02:31), not "Authorize_Refund". Again, "Authorize_Refund" (timestamp 2025-03-03 10:22:18) occurs *after* "Update_Inventory" in this case.

Therefore, the claim that "Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately *before* “Update_Inventory” is not supported by the provided data.
