Based on the provided Contoso Airlines' flight-refund process, I'll summarise the decision points and list the required documents.

**Decision Points:**
1. The process implicitly decides whether the refund amount is greater than â‚¬1,000, determining whether the case proceeds to the **Senior_Auditor_Review** step.
 
**Required Documents:**
1. *RefundRequestForm*
2. *FlightManifest*
3. *WeatherReport*
4. *EligibilityChecklist*
5. *AuditTrail* (for high-value claims)
6. *BankTransferAuthorization*
7. *RefundConfirmationPDF*

These documents are used throughout the process, from the initial customer claim to the final confirmation letter.
