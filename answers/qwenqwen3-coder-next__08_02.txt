**Question 1:** No.  
**Question 2:** Because T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. P2 is only produced by T1 and consumed by T3. P5 is only produced by T4, which requires P4, which is produced by either T2 (via P1) or T3. Thus, to get a token in P5, T3 must have fired (to get to P4 → T4 → P5). Since T3 consumes P2, P2 is gone before P5 exists—so T5 (needing P2 *and* P5) cannot fire before T3.
