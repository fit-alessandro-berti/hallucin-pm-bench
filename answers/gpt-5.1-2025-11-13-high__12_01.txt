No, the fact is **not** accurate for this event-log fragment.

- **Case 1001**: `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund` (`... Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund ...`), not after it.  
- **Case 1002**: `Authorize_Refund` is followed by `Refund_Issued`; `Update_Inventory` does **not** occur at all.  
- **Case 1003**: `Update_Inventory` occurs earlier and is separated from `Authorize_Refund` by `Quality_Check` (`... Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund`).  

In no case does `Authorize_Refund` occur immediately before `Update_Inventory`.
