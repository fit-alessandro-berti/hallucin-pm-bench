**Answer 1:** Yes, T5 can fire before T3.  

**Answer 2:** Minimal firing sequence:  
1. T1 (splits into P1, P2)  
2. T2 (consumes P1, produces P3)  
3. T7 (consumes P3, produces P4)  
4. T4 (consumes P4, produces P5)  
5. T5 (consumes P2 and P5, produces P6).  

T3 is never fired in this sequence. T5 fires because P2 (from T1) and P5 (from T4) are available, bypassing T3.  

(Explanation: T3 is not a prerequisite for T5—only P2 and P5 are needed. P5 can be produced via T1→T2→T7→T4 while P2 remains from T1.)
