Add a **non-interrupting timer boundary event** (attached to `Task_Triage`) with a 48-hour cycle to monitor SLA compliance. If `Task_Triage` isn't reached within 48 hours (from process start), the timer triggers and redirects flow to `Task_Notify` via a new conditional sequence flow from the timer to `Task_Notify`, bypassing delayed steps. This enforces escalation without new tasks by leveraging the existing notification activity when the SLA is breached. Modify `Task_Notify` to handle both normal and escalation notifications.
