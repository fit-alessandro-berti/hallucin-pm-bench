**Added tasks**  
• **Verify Identity** (id: `Task_VerifyIdentity`)  
• **Request Additional Documents** (id: `Task_RequestDocs`)  
• **Final Reject** (id: `Task_FinalReject`)  

**Removed tasks**  
• **Reject Loan** (id: `Task_RejectLoan` from BPMN_v1)  

**Gateway-type changes**  
• The gateway **Eligible?** (id: `Gateway_Decision`) changed from an **Exclusive Gateway** in BPMN_v1 to an **Inclusive Gateway** in BPMN_v2. Its name was updated to *"Eligibility Check"*, but this is a functional (not cosmetic) change due to the gateway type alteration.
