1) Request_Documents (Worst)  
- Avg wait: 36.5h; 95th percentile: 120.0h

2) Send_Closure_Letter  
- Avg wait: 12.2h; 95th percentile: 44.0h

3) Assess_Liability  
- Avg wait: 7.8h; 95th percentile: 16.4h  
- Action: Introduce priority routing for aged items and redistribute cases based on actual queue lengths; historical queue data show this rebalancing can reduce waiting by ≥20%.
