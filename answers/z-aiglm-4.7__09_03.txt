I cannot compute the requested metrics because Artefact A (the event-log stub) contains only column headers, with all data rows and specific timestamp values explicitly redacted for privacy. Calculating the cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence intervals requires the raw start_time and complete_time data for the "Approve Invoice" activity, which is currently absent from the provided information.
