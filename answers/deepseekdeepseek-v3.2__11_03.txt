**Subject: Identification of Worst-Performing Activities in Credit Process**  

Based on the process performance data, the three worst-performing activities, evaluated jointly for SLA breaches and high waiting times, are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds, with an average waiting time of 600 seconds. Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with an average waiting time of 480 seconds. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, with an average waiting time of 200 seconds.  

To address these inefficiencies, the following data-driven actions are recommended:  
- For Legal Approval, reallocate resources to reduce the average waiting time of 600 seconds, directly targeting the primary driver of the SLA breach.  
- For Risk Review, implement queue management techniques to decrease the average waiting time of 480 seconds, aligning throughput with the 300-second SLA.  
- For Credit Assessment, streamline workflow to lower the average waiting time of 200 seconds, ensuring compliance with the 240-second SLA.
