 No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. This is because in order for T5 to fire, place p4 must contain zero tokens (due to the inhibitor arc). However, the only way for p4 to obtain a token is through the firing of transition T3. Therefore, T3 must fire before T5 can be enabled.
