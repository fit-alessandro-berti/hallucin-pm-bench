 In this Petri net, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking. This is because the enabling of T5 depends on the presence of tokens in places pd and pe, which can only be obtained after the firing of transition T2 or T2b (since T3 is the continuation of the normal path from T2). However, both T2 and T2b have pc as their output place, which is the input place for T3. Therefore, T3 must fire before T5 can fire, as T3 consumes the token that T2 or T2b produced in place pc.

Formally, we can say that the firing of T5 is conditionally enabled by the presence of tokens in places pd and pe. Since the enabling of place pd depends on the firing of T2 or T2b, and the enabling of place pe depends on the feedback loop (T6 and its subsequent transitions), we can see that T5's enabling is indirectly dependent on the firing of T3 (which consumes the token produced by T2 or T2b). Therefore, it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.
