No.

In cases C003 (lines 6–7) and C005 (lines 11–12), *Validate_Payment* occurs without first being preceded by *Receive_Order*. In C003, *Validate_Payment* (line 6) happens before *Receive_Order* (line 7), so it does not follow it. In C005, *Validate_Payment* (line 11) is followed directly by *Cancel_Order* with no preceding *Receive_Order* in that case’s events. These examples show that *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* in the log.
