1) 1 occurrence (only in case C05).

2) Percentages
   a) Of all events: 2.08% (1/48)
   b) Of all cases: 8.33% (1/12)

3) With only one instance, any estimates of its duration, waiting time, or path probabilities are non-robust. Process discovery can overfit to a rare branch; predictive models may assign unstable or spurious importance to this feature. Generalizing from this slice risks misestimating bottlenecks, transition frequencies, and the activityâ€™s impact on outcomes.
