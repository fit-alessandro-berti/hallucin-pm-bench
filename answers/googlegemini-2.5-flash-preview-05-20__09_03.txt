**Analysis of Orion Aerospace GmbH P2P Workflow â€“ Process-Mining Audit**

**1. Average Cycle Time of "Approve Invoice":**

It is **not possible** to compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity "Approve Invoice" from the supplied event log stub.

**2. Standard Deviation and 95% Confidence Interval for "Approve Invoice" Cycle Time:**

It is also **not possible** to compute the standard deviation or a 95% confidence interval for the cycle time of "Approve Invoice" from the supplied information.

**3. Justification for Inability to Compute Metrics:**

The event log provided (Artefact A) is a stub with only the header row and a note stating that "Every row and every timestamp value has been removed for privacy." To compute the cycle time of an activity, we would require the `start_time` and `complete_time` for each instance of the "Approve Invoice" activity. Without any actual event data, specifically the timestamps for specific activities within individual `case_id`s, no cycle time calculations can be performed. Artefact B provides historical average data but does not contain the granular event-level timestamps necessary for a new computation from a log.
