I'll identify all task pairs in Process B that can be executed in parallel, listing them alphabetically as requested.

Looking at Process B (Manufacturing_WorkOrder), two sets of tasks can run in parallel:

1. **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** can run simultaneously after Create_Work_Order
2. **Create_Documentation** and **Quality_Check** begin in parallel after Fabricate

Arranging these pairs in alphabetical order (both within pairs and the overall list):

Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines
