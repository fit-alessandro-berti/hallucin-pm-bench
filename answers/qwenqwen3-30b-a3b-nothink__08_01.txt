**Answer: Yes**, **it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3**.

### ‚úÖ **Firing Sequence:**

1. **T1 fires**:  
   - From initial marking: p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)  
   - After T1: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

2. **T5 fires**:  
   - T5 has an **inhibitor arc** from p4. At this point, p4 = 0, so T5 is **enabled**.  
   - After T5: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1)

---

### üîç **Justification:**

- T5 requires that p4 is **empty** (due to the inhibitor arc).  
- Since T3 has not yet fired, p4 remains at 0.  
- Thus, **T5 is enabled** even though p1 has tokens and T1 has already fired.  
- T5 can fire **without** firing T3.

---

### üß† **Key Observations:**

- T5 is **not blocked** by any token in p1 or p2, despite their presence.  
- The **inhibitor arc** from p4 to T5 is sufficient to **enable** T5 when p4 = 0.  
- Therefore, **T5 can fire before T3**.

### ‚úÖ **Conclusion:**

**Yes**, it is possible for **T5 to fire before T3**.

**Example sequence:** T1 ‚Üí T5
