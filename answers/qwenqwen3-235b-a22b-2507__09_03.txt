It is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice". The event log contains only the column headers, and all row data—including timestamps, case identifiers, and activity instances—have been redacted. Without actual event records, it is impossible to determine when the "Approve Invoice" activity started or ended, and therefore no time-based metric can be calculated. The SLA catalogue provides contextual performance expectations but does not contain granular event data required for cycle time analysis.
