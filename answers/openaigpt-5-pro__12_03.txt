1) No.

2) Counterexamples in the log:
- C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment (Validate_Payment is not immediately after Receive_Order)
- C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment (Validate_Payment is not immediately after Receive_Order)

For completeness, it does occur immediately after in C001 (Receive_Order → Validate_Payment) and C003 (Receive_Order → Validate_Payment), but the “always” claim is false due to C002 and C004.
