No.

The stated fact is not accurate because the activity `Validate_Payment` does not always follow `Receive_Order`. For case C003, `Validate_Payment` occurs on line 6 *before* `Receive_Order` on line 7. Additionally, for case C005, `Validate_Payment` on line 11 is the first activity recorded for that case, meaning it does not follow `Receive_Order` in that specific case as `Receive_Order` does not precede it.
