**Decision Points:**  
1. After **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** checks eligibility.  
2. After **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** approves the claim.  
3. If the refund amount exceeds €1,000, **Senior_Auditor_Review** must be initiated with an **AuditTrail**.  

**Required Documents:**  
- EligibilityChecklist (for finance approval).  
- FlightManifest and WeatherReport (for eligibility validation).  
- BankTransferAuthorization (for payment processing).  
- AuditTrail (for Senior_Auditor_Review when required).  
- RefundConfirmation_Pdf (though post-payment, not mentioned in steps, implied via final step).  

(Note: Adjustments made to align strictly with process constraints and implied documentation.)
