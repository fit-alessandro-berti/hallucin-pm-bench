This is an analysis of the provided safe Petri net for OmniShop Inc.’s “Expedited Returns” subprocess.

The question asks: **In any reachable marking of this net, is it possible for transition T5 to fire *before* transition T3?**

---

## Analysis

To determine this, let's trace the conditions required for T5 to fire, and the conditions required for T3 to fire.

**Initial Marking ($M_0$):** $\{p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)\}$

### 1. Firing Condition for T3
Transition T3 requires a token in $p2$: $T3$ enabled $\iff M(p2) \geq 1$.
T3 produces tokens in $p4$: $p2 \to p4$.

### 2. Firing Condition for T5
Transition T5 has two requirements:
1. **Normal Arc:** Requires a token in $p3$: $M(p3) \geq 1$.
2. **Inhibitor Arc:** Requires **zero** tokens in $p4$: $M(p4) = 0$.

T5 produces a token in $p6$: $p3 \to p6$.

### Can T5 fire before T3?

For T5 to fire *before* T3, the sequence must be $T1 \rightarrow T5$, or $T5$ immediately after $T1$.

1. **Fire T1:**
   $M_0 = \{p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)\}$
   T1 fires: $M_1 = \{p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)\}$

2. **Examine T5 at $M_1$:**
   * $M_1(p3) = 0$. **T5 is NOT enabled** because it requires $M(p3) \geq 1$.

3. **Examine T3 at $M_1$:**
   * $M_1(p2) = 1$. **T3 IS enabled.**

If T3 fires next:
$M_2 = \{p0(0), p1(1), p2(0), p3(1), p4(1), p5(0), p6(0)\}$

Now, let's check T5 at $M_2$:
* $M_2(p3) = 1$ (Requirement met).
* $M_2(p4) = 1$ (Inhibitor requirement **NOT** met, as $M(p4)$ must be 0). **T5 is NOT enabled.**

## Conclusion and Proof

**No, it is impossible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.**

### Short Proof of Impossibility

1. **T1 fires first** to enable the processes flowing to $p3$ (for T5) and $p4$ (which blocks T5).
   $$M_0 \xrightarrow{T1} M_1 = \{p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), \dots \}$$

2. **Enabling T5:** T5 requires tokens in $p3$ (normal arc) *and* zero tokens in $p4$ (inhibitor arc).
   * In $M_1$, $p3$ has 0 tokens, so T5 cannot fire immediately after T1.

3. **Enabling $p3$ (for T5):** The only way to get a token into $p3$ is by firing T2 ($p1 \to p3$).
   * Firing T2 requires $p1 \geq 1$. This is true in $M_1$.
   $$M_1 \xrightarrow{T2} M_{1,2} = \{p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), \dots \}$$

4. **Checking T5 at $M_{1,2}$:**
   * $M_{1,2}(p3) = 1$ (OK)
   * $M_{1,2}(p4) = 0$ (OK, inhibitor arc satisfied)
   * **T5 is enabled.**

5. **Enabling T3:** T3 requires $p2 \geq 1$. This is true in $M_1$ and $M_{1,2}$. T3 is enabled concurrently with T2 at $M_1$.

**The critical observation is that to enable T5, $p3$ must receive a token via T2.**

* **If T2 fires before T3**, we reach $M_{1,2}$, and T5 *can* fire.
* **If T3 fires before T2**, T3 places a token in $p4$. $M_0 \xrightarrow{T1} M_1 \xrightarrow{T3} M_2 = \{p1(1), p2(0), p3(0), p4(1), \dots \}$. At $M_2$, T5 cannot fire because $p3$ is empty. T2 cannot fire because $p1$ is present but T3 takes precedence over T2 if we consider a sequence where T3 fires immediately after T1.

Since the question asks if T5 can fire *before* T3, we must check if there is a sequence where T3 has not yet fired, but T5 has.

If T5 fires at step $k$, then T3 must not have fired in steps $1$ through $k-1$.

If $T5$ fires at step $k$ (i.e., $T_1, T_2, T_5, \dots$):
1. $T_1$ fires. ($p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0)$)
2. $T_2$ fires. ($p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0)$)
3. $T_5$ fires. ($p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p6(1)$) $\rightarrow$ **T5 fired before T3.**

**RE-EVALUATION**: My initial analysis of the *earliest* possible firing of T5 excluded the T2 path required to enable it.

$M_0 \xrightarrow{T1} M_1 = \{p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0)\}$

At $M_1$:
* T3 is enabled ($p2=1$).
* T2 is enabled ($p1=1$).
* T5 is **disabled** ($p3=0$).

If we choose the path $T_1 \to T_2 \to T_5$ **before** $T_3$ fires:
1. $M_1 \xrightarrow{T2} M_{1,2} = \{p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0)\}$
2. At $M_{1,2}$, T3 is enabled ($p2=1$) and T5 is enabled ($p3=1, p4=0$).
   If the scheduler chooses $T_5$:
   $$M_{1,2} \xrightarrow{T5} M_{1,2,5} = \{p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p6(1)\}$$

In the sequence $\mathbf{T1, T2, T5}$, T5 fired, and T3 has not fired yet.

## Final Answer

**Yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Concrete Firing Sequence:** $\mathbf{T1, T2, T5}$

**Justification:**

1.  **Fire T1:** $M_0 \rightarrow M_1 = \{p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), \dots \}$. (Both T2 and T3 are now enabled).
2.  **Fire T2:** $M_1 \rightarrow M_{1,2} = \{p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), \dots \}$. (T3 is still enabled, but T5 is now enabled because $p3=1$ and $p4=0$).
3.  **Fire T5:** Since T5 is enabled, we select it. $M_{1,2} \rightarrow M_{1,2,5} = \{p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p6(1)\}$.

In this sequence, T5 fired successfully, and T3 has not fired yet. (T3 can still fire next, resulting in $p4=1$).
