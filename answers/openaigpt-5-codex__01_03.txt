**a) Decision points**

1. **Post–Tri-Color Risk Check branch:** If the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is ≤ €250 000, the process bypasses Manual Underwriting; otherwise, it proceeds to that review.  
2. **Decision Gate “TriVote”:** The loan advances only when at least any two of the three gatekeepers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve it.
