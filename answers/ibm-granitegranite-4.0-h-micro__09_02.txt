Based on the provided event log data, the average cycle time for the "Dual Authorization" activity cannot be determined. This is because the event log only provides the occurrence counts for each activity (start and complete) without any timestamps or duration information. Without the actual time taken for each instance of the "Dual Authorization" activity, it is impossible to calculate the average cycle time.
