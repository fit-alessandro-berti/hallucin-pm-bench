**R1.** **Compliant** – PO > €10,000 has Manager then Finance approval.  
**R2.** **Violated** – Ship_Goods is after Change_Request, not within 2 days of last approval.  
**R3.** **Violated** – Pay_Invoice occurs before Receive_Goods.  
**R4.** **Not Applicable** – Hazardous = false, so rule does not apply.  
**R5.** **Compliant** – Change_Request after Finance_Approval is followed by new Manager_Approval.  
**R6.** **Compliant** – Case ends with Archive_Record.  

**Overall Result: NON-COMPLIANT**
