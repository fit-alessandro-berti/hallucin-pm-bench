2. The snippet shows only 3 cases from a single day (March 1), making it a tiny, non‑representative sample. Seeing one “Manual Fraud Check” out of three cases could lead an analyst to overestimate its frequency (e.g., 33 %). Conversely, manual checks may be rare events or clustered on specific dates due to business rules, fraud patterns, or system changes not captured here. Without knowing the total monthly case volume, daily variation, or what triggers manual vs. automatic checks, any extrapolation is unreliable. The sample’s temporal concentration and minimal size create sampling bias, causing either over‑ or under‑estimation.
