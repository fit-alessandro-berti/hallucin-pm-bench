**Answer 1.** Yes, T5 can fire before T3. The initial token in P0 enables T1, producing tokens in P1 and P2. T2 can then fire, moving the token from P1 to P3, and T7 can fire, moving it to P4. Meanwhile, P2 remains unprocessed. T4 can then fire, moving the token from P4 to P5. Now, T5 requires P2 and P5, which are both marked, allowing T5 to fire before T3.

**Answer 2 (bonus).** Minimal firing sequence: [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]. This sequence ensures T5 fires before T3 by bypassing T3 entirely. T3 is unnecessary for T5 to fire.
