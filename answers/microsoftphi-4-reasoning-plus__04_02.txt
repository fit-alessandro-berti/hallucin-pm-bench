We are Phi. Let me read careful the question. There's auditing scenario for Globex Corp's Purchase-to-Pay process. I see compliance rules R1 to R6, then event trace list of events. We must produce answer: For each rule: "Compliant", "Violated", or "Not Applicable", and a ≤ 20 word justification each. Then overall result "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".

We are given specific instructions: "examine compliance rules R1–R6, analyze event trace for case #47291. For each rule, say Compliant, Violated, or Not Applicable, followed by ≤20-word justification, conclude with overall result: COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT (all caps)". 

We must check events. I'll mark order events:

Given event trace events:

1. Create_PO amount= €12,450, expedited= true, hazardous= false, time: March 03, 09:12
2. Manager_Approval; time: Mar 03, 11:05.
3. Finance_Approval; time: Mar 04, 08:17.
4. Change_Request; time: Mar 04, 15:42.
5. Ship_Goods; time: Mar 05, 10:26. 
6. Receive_Goods; time: Mar 07, 14:13.
7. Pay_Invoice; time: Mar 06, 09:00.
8. Manager_Approval; time: Mar 07, 15:10.
9. Store_Goods; time: Mar 07, 16:02.
10. Archive_Record; Mar 07, 16:20.

I will check each rule, list them as R1 through R6.

Rules:

R1: "Any purchase order with total_amount > €10 000 must have Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval." Our PO about €12,450 so condition is triggered. Sequence: Event 2 is Manager_Approval on 2025-03-03 11:05, then event 3 is Finance_Approval, on March 04, 08:17, yes. But then events after finance approval are Change_Request on March 04, however that doesn't affect R1. There's an additional Manager_Approval afterwards. But that's not required? But we required that if this rule triggered because total > €10 000, then the process must have Manager_Approval then Finance_Approval. We got those events, even though extra Manager approval event was executed after "Change_Request" event. In any case, the sequence of events must be "Manager_Approval" followed by "Finance_Approval" after Create_PO. In our sequence we got Manager Approval then Finance Approval chrono (they are there) so rule is satisfied? But then re-read the rule: if PO is > €10k, must have Manager_Approval *followed by* Finance_Approval. Just that, no further dependency on after optional changes. So yes Condition satisfied because we get Manager Approval occurred before Finance Approval for PO value > €10000. Actually one slight nuance: There is a later Manager Approval event again. But rule states "must have Manager Approval followed by Finance Approval" if PO > €10000. Did that occur? Yes. So likely R1: Compliant.

I'll check events times: Create_PO 3-03 9:12. Then event Manager_Approval as soon as March 03 at 11:05 which is before Finance approval at 4-08 which is March 04, 08:17. The rules don't state time sensitivity, but they mention "within some time"? Actually rule R1 doesn't impose time limit. It is simply that the order must go: Manager Approval (at any time, but stand before any subsequent events? So, "any PO must have manager then finance"? No constraints regarding how soon after but using ordering is sufficient: Manager_Approval comes after Create_PO then Finance_Approval must follow. And in our sequence, that order is indeed satisfied because Finance Approval occurred after manager approval even though there's additional changes. It is triggered by total amount > €10000 condition. Yes so rule R1 is ok.

R2: "If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." Which "last required approval" means? Let's see: as PO is expedited and there is a "Ship_Goods" event later? Rule: "if expedited = true" then if separated via calendar days count from last required approval. But what are required approvals? Are they the ones mandated by rule R1 or by rule R5? Likely the approval events mentioned in the rules are Manager_Approval, Finance_Approval, etc. But R2 specifically: "If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." But which is "last required approval"? Note: Rule R5 "if Change_Request happens after any approval, purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." It says further processing step. The instruction likely means: in expedited scenario, Ship_Goods should occur within two days after the last required approval that it must follow. Actually, it's ambiguous from these rules. R2 is clear: if expedited, shipping must occur within 2 days of last required approval. In our case, "last required approval" is tricky. We have two approvals: first ManagerApproval (03-03 11:05) and then Finance Approval (03-04 08:17). But then after that, there was Change_Request on 03-04 15:42, which is after a required approval event. However, rule R5 says if a change request happens after any approval, the PO must obtain new manager approval before further processing (i.e. before processing the next step which would be ship goods? Possibly). But it's ambiguous. Let's parse R5: "If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." We then see sequence events: after Finance_Approval, there is Change_Request at 03-04 15:42. Then event to process: It might have replaced one of the previous approvals. The PO then does Ship_Goods on March 05 10:26. However, rule says that the PO must get new Manager_Approval before further processing step. But we see that new Manager_Approval event is event 8 at 03-07 15:10. But Ship_Goods occurred on March 05, not after the new approval. So does that violate rule? Let's check carefully:

Number of events in order:
Create_PO set expedited = true. 
Then events: Manager Approval, Finance Approval (03-04 08:17), then Change_Request (03-04 15:42). After that, Ship_Goods occurs on 03-05 10:26. But rule R5 is triggered: after any approval if a Change_Request happens, it must obtain a new Manager_Approval. That is said to apply before any further processing step after the Change_Request. The new Manager_Approval occurs on 03-0715:10, which is after Ship_Goods event. So does that violate R5? Yes, if Ship_Goods is processed before new manager approval after a change request event. But wait, let's inspect ordering: does rule R5 require new Manager Approval before "any further processing" that uses the changed ordering. "Before any further processing step" might not apply to Ship_Goods. But then R2 says if expedited, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval (which one is it?). So the rules might conflict? Let me check each rule:

R5: "If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." I'm trying to read: "after any approval" means if any change request happens after an approval event (which includes the initial approvals, i.e. if a approval has happened then a change request happens afterwards in the trace, regardless of which approval happens first). In our trace, a Change_Request event did indeed occur at 03-04 15:42 after the Finance approval, so rule R5 is triggered. And then the new Manager_Approval is at event 8 at 03-07 15:10. But this new manager approval happens after the Ship_Goods event. The question: Does the timing constraint of R2 consider the new approval or the original approvals? Let me re-read rule R2 carefully: "If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." "Last required approval" might be ambiguous because it might be the last one among the ones that were required by the PO, depending if changes were not applied. However, rule R5 says "the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval" if there's a change request. But then maybe the "required approvals" list is updated: after a change request, it requires a fresh manager approval before proceeding further. So what does that mean then for R2? The new R2 timeline possibly: if expedited = true, Ship_Goods must be triggered within 2 calendar days after the last required approval. But then from the chain: initial approvals occurred: Manager, then Finance. Then after change request appears in trace, there is now a mandated extra required approval (new Manager Approval) that must come before processing any further steps (likely before Ship_Goods should be processed). If we take that logically: After the first approval, the mapping of approvals might be either original manager and finance approvals are considered valid up until change request happened. But rule R5 states that purchase order must get new Manager Approval before any further processing step after a change request in an expedited process (or just any process)? Possibly rule R5 is not restricted to expedited orders. But then the In our trace, the change request comes before Ship_Goods event, while the new Manager_Approval comes after Ship_Goods event. So regardless of whether expedited rule R2 triggers, it might fail due R5 or R2.

But let's check order: R5: if change request happened after any approval, the PO must obtain new manager approval before any further processing. "Before any further processing step" might be interpreted as "Ship_Goods" is further processing, thus before that event, a new Manager Approval should have occurred. But our process did Ship_Goods on 03-05 10:26, which is before new manager approval happens (new manager approval event at 03-07 15:10). So yes, R5 is violated unless the old manager approval remains in effect. But rule R5 says if a change request happens after ANY approval, then the purchase order must have a new Manager Approval before any further processing step. The PO here had a manager approval at event 2, but that does not count once a change request has occurred after some approval. But note, then also we check R2: If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval. The "last required approval" if triggered by change request, would presumably become the new manager approval. I'd need to decide what R2's "last required approval" stands for: given that there's a change request after the Finance approval, does that then require that Ship_Goods should have occurred within 2 days after the new management approval? The new manager approval did not take place until after Ship_Goods occurs. So if we consider that, then R2 is violated because Ship_Goods did occur within 2 days after the later required approval? Actually, wait. If there was a change request then the earlier approvals are not valid for shipping the goods because new manager approval is required. So if a change request happened, then Ship_Goods must occur within 2 days after new manager approval. But the new manager approval is at 03-07 15:10, which is after the Ship_Goods event (03-05 10:26) by almost 2 days difference, so R2 would be violated because it occurred too late after the required approval. However, let me evaluate the timeline:

Expedited purchase order: must be processed quickly. The rule R2: "if expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." Now which "last required approval" in our timeline? Initially, one would think it is the Finance Approval (because manager approval happens first and finance is the next approval needed for a PO > €10000) allowed by R1. But then there's a change request after Finance approval, which then triggers rule R5, which imposes a new Manager Approval. So the "last required approval" likely would now be the new manager approval that occurs after the change request. Thus, the required shipping deadline is after that new manager approval event. But our events: Ship_Goods happened on 03-05 10:26, but the new manager approval occurred on 03-07 15:10, meaning that the required shipping deadline after the new manager approval should be on 03-09 within two days, but we already had shipment happening on 03-05. So if from the ordering of events, it appears that a change request has occurred after the initial approvals, then the new processing should start from the new manager approval, but the actual shipping event was executed before the new manager approval occurred. So that violates R5 further. Let's check R5 rule carefully: There is explicit text: "If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." So which further processing step should look at? Ship_Goods is clearly a processing step. In our trace, the change request was on 03-04 15:42, and the next processing step is Ship_Goods on 03-05 10:26, which was executed before the new manager approval (which came on 03-07 15:10). That is a clear violation with respect to rule R5. Therefore, case #47291 violates R5.

Now check R3: "Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods." In our trace, event 7, Pay_Invoice, occurred at 09:00 on Mar 06, but Receive_Goods event occurs at 14:13 on Mar 07. So Pay_Invoice came before Receive_Goods. That is a violation of R3. But wait, sometimes invoice payments maybe occur after goods receipt. But rule R3 seems to be in the correct order: Receive_Goods must have happened before Pay_Invoice. But it didn't, it's reversed. Actually error: We see event 7: Pay_Invoice is on March 06, event 6: Receive_Goods is on March 07? Wait, check events: Actually the provided chronology: Event 1: Create_PO on 03-03. Then Manager Approval on 03-03. Finance Approval on 03-04. Change Request on 03-04. Ship Goods on 03-05 10:26. Then Receive_Goods occurs on 03-07 14:13, but before that, Pay Invoice occurs on 03-06 09:00. Yes, so Pay invoice occurred before receiving goods. That violates rule R3. Yes, since rule R3 says "Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods." Therefore, R3 is violated.

Now rule R4: "If hazardous = true, a Safety_Inspection must occur after Receive_Goods and before Store_Goods." Our PO: hazardous = false. So R4 doesn't apply, since trigger condition not met. Therefore, rule R4 is "Not Applicable".

Rule R6: "Every case must terminate with Archive_Record." Our trace ends with event 10 Archive_Record. So that's fine. But wait: But we found violation of other rules. However, when answering we must list for each rule if it's compliant or violated. And overall result is overall whether the process is compliant overall. But since at least one is violated, overall would be NON-COMPLIANT.

Let's check each rule individually:

R1: PO value > €10000. Sequence: Manager Approval then Finance Approval is done. However, consider the scenario with Change Request. But no extra requirement in R1 regarding changes. It says the PO must have Manager Approval followed by Finance Approval." And that condition is satisfied because we see those events in order before any further steps. So R1 is Compliant.

R2: Expedited is true. "Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." We must determine what's the "last required approval". The PO is expedited. There are two possibilities: Either it's "Finance Approval" or "new Manager Approval" due to change request which I'm more in favor of. But the instruction in R5 "if a change request happens after any approval, the PO must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing" means that after the change request, any further processing steps require the new Manager approval rather than the original ones. But then, what is "last required approval" for R2 after processing steps? Given the intended idea is that if expedited, final processing should be fast. I think the intended timeline is: if expedited is true, then after the last required approval that is needed to process the changed order (i.e., after the newly required manager approval after change request) ship goods must occur within 2 days. In our case, that new manager approval occurred on 03-07 15:10. And Ship_Goods occurred on 03-05 10:26, well before that. So in either reading (if we consider original approvals being outdated after a change request, then it's still a violation of R5, which might imply that the final required event for processing should be the new manager approval). Alternatively, maybe R2 is computed using the original approvals. But then R5 rule is triggered by change request, which would require a new manager approval before proceeding. But if that new required approval is considered, then the shipping time frame becomes irrelevant if shipping already occurred. If R2 still considered original approvals, then what's the timeline: Largest required approval event among the two events: one possibility is the Finance Approval on 03-04 08:17. 2 days after that would be March 06 08:17 at the latest. But Ship Goods at 03-05 10:26 is well within 2 days after 03-04 08:17. Yes, see: Two days after March 04 08:17 is March 06 08:17, so that is acceptable if we consider the Finance Approval. But wait, if we consider the first manager approval (03-03 11:05) then two days later would be 03-05 11:05, but Ship_Goods happens on 03-05 10:26, which is less than 11:05. So that's acceptable. But then rule R5 would expect a new manager approval before Ship Goods because of the change request. But then what is the order: Which approval did we consider for time calculation in R2? The rule says "within 2 calendar days after the last required approval". If we had only initial approvals, then the last required approval is "Finance Approval" because that must follow manager approval and is the last required approval for finishing the order processing. But then rule R5 would override that condition. However, rule R2 doesn't include condition on whether change request events occurred. It just says if expedited equals true, ship goods must occur within 2 calendar days after last required approval. But then if a change request happened after any approval, then that last required approval would logically be updated? The rules order: R1 and R2 are baseline. R5 is a modification rule: if a change request happens after any approval, then the process must get a new manager approval before any processing step. That implies that after the change request, the earlier signatures are not valid for further processing. So if a change request happens before an event that should be post-approval, then that required approval is now considered to be the newly obtained manager approval. This is my interpretation that, after change request, the final required approval (for further processing steps) is not the original finance approval but the new manager approval mandated by R5. However, the language "last required approval" in rule R2 could be ambiguous. Let me re-read rule R2 exactly: "If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." The term "required approval" might be interpreted as just any approval that the process mandates for the PO (manager and finance approvals). In our PO, those would be manager and finance approvals, and the "last required approval" would be finance approval, right? Because manager then finance order. But then R5 specifically states "if a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." So if a change request occurs after one of those approvals, that effectively invalidates the previous approvals for the subsequent processing steps. It implies that further processing cannot occur until the new manager approval occurs. But rule R2 is triggered if a "Ship_Goods" occurs, then its shipping time should be counted from the new manager approval if it occurred after the change request? But in our case, new manager approval has not occurred before shipping. So then the shipping time limit is invalidated because it wasn't done after obtaining the new required manager approval. So yes, R2 might be violated because Ship_Goods didn't wait until after the new approval. But let's check possible timeline: if we consider that the new approval is required for any further processing step after change request, then before ship goods occurred, the last required approval might be considered as having been updated to the new manager approval. But in that case, it would be considered that none of the earlier approvals count because the change request invalidated them. But then rule R2 might have been misinterpreted: It's ambiguous: maybe rule R2 always expects to use the last approvals from the original process? How to determine? Let me consider the scenario logically. The rules bank on sequential order: The process begins with a PO. For orders above threshold, you require manager and finance approval. That is done by R1. Then expedition is triggered. Then if expedited, you have a deadline, and shipping must happen quickly: within 2 days after last required approval. But then an update modifies the process: If a change request happens after an approval, a new manager approval must occur. The logic behind that rule is that the original manager approval might not be applicable after a change request (because the specs changed such as delivery address) and thus a new manager approval is needed. So the new required approval is mandated and must be completed before shipping (or before further processing). Given that a change_request event happened at 15:42 on 03-04 (day, hour) after finance approval, then any further processing step (e.g. shipping goods) must wait until a new manager approval event occurs to update the previously approved order. So if new manager approval did not occur before shipping, then shipping is improper because the goods are shipped based on outdated approval which is invalidated by the change request. Therefore, rule R2 might well be considered violated independently, but we need to decide which timing is used. Because if we took the initial approvals (Manager Approval, Finance Approval) as baseline then shipping meets R2. But then it would be a violation of rule R5 if shipping occurs after change request. Which rule takes precedence? There's no explicit rule ordering precedence, but the requirement "new Manager_Approval" in rule R5 is a mandated action if change request happens. In our event trace, the new Manager_Approval event is event 8, which occurs on 03-07 15:10, which is after all other processing steps. So rule R5 clearly is violated because it occurred after a change request but not before Ship_Goods. The timeline: Change request at 03-04 15:42. Then Ship goods event on 03-05 10:26, which is further processing. According to rule R5, before ship goods, a new manager approval should have occurred. It didn't, so rule R5 is violated. So for rule R5: "Violated" because Ship_Goods occurred after a change request without new Manager_Approval. And its justification: "Ship_Goods executed before new Manager_Approval post change_request, violating rule R5."

Then rule R2, again we check: If expedited true, ship goods must happen within 2 calendar days after the last required approval. But what is "the last required approval"? Let's re-read the text: "If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." The change-of-sequence mandated by rule R5 suggests that the last required approval should be re-defined when a change request happens. So which approval is considered? The initial approvals: Manager (event 2) and Finance (event 3) are part of the original order processing. But rule R5 is triggered because a change_request occurs after the Finance approval. It states that a new required approval, the new Manager Approval, is required. Therefore, the effective last required approval for further processing steps after change request is the new Manager Approval. Because if that new approval is required prior to further processing, then the new approval should be considered the actual "timestamp" from which to measure the 2-day window. Now, look at the timeline of events. Change request event at 15:42 on 03-04. The next processing step is Ship Goods event at 10:26 on 03-05. But then the new Manager Approval is at 15:10 on 03-07, which is after ship goods event. Now, it's ambiguous: sometimes a shipping processing might proceed even if no new approval occurred after change request. That would not satisfy rule R2. But also rule R5 expects new manager approval before shipping. We already found a violation with rule R5. And if we assume new manager approval is required, then the deadline for shipping should be measured from that approval event. In that case, the shipping event occurred too early: it should occur within 2 days after the new manager approval event, but that new manager approval event (event 8) happens after shipping, so shipping term is not satisfied. So R2 must be considered violated if we consider that a change request resets the approval requirement, thereby shifting the timeline start. However, there is an alternative interpretation: The "last required approval" is the final approval from the initial PO approval process regardless of subsequent events? But rule R5 seems to explicitly say that after any change request, a new Manager Approval is required BEFORE any further processing. Therefore, if a change request occurred and the processing event occurred before a new manager approval, then R5 is obviously violated, but then if we consider R2, the processing event should have occurred within 2 days after the new manager approval before Ship-Goods could have been allowed to proceed. But if ship goods occurred before new manager approval, both rules are violated. 

Thus R2 in context: Since change request occurs and then Ship_Goods executed without the new manager approval that is required in that situation, rule R2's condition is not satisfied because the correct timeline (i.e. ship goods must occur within 2 days after the new Manager Approval, but new manager approval didn't happen) is not met. Therefore, R2 is violated.

Wait, wait be careful: Rule R2 states, "If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." In our event trace, expedited is true, so condition applies. But what is the "last required approval"? Possibly the required approvals are those in R1 which are Manager_Approval and Finance_Approval. But then the wording "last required approval" simply means the last one in order. If we disregard rule R5 precedence reasoning, then the PO processing events to-date would be: Create_PO (03-03), Manager approval (03-03), Finance Approval (03-04). Then no further approval happens by the time ship goods occurs in event 5 (03-05). And check R2: Shipping occurred on 03-05, which is within 2 calendar days after the last required approval (Finance approval on 03-04, 2 days later being 03-06, 08:17 max). So if we consider the approval timeline independent of rule R5, then R2 is compliant because ship goods occurred timely relative to finance approval. But then rule R5 is violated because new manager approval did not occur before continuing further processing after a change request. But is it possible that rule R5 takes precedence? The question states: "For each rule: say Compliant, Violated, or Not Applicable" and then "followed by <=20 word justification." The instructions do not instruct to disregard rule R2 if rule R5 is broken. But in our case, if you consider the chain of events: For R2, in the absence of R5, we have valid sequence: Ship Goods happened (03-05). When measured from the finance approval (03-04), that is within 2 days (by 03-06). But there's a nuance: rule R5 might state that after a change request, further processing must wait for new approval. But then locating "last required approval" in rule R2: it doesn't mention whether the concept of "required approval" includes the new one if a change request occurred. Let me read R5 exactly: "If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." The phrase "before any further processing step" would include Ship_Goods if it is considered further processing. In our event order: after the change request (03-04 15:42), the next processing step is Ship_Goods (03-05). So new manager approval should be executed before that, but it is not executed until event 8. So rule R5 is clearly violated. But what about rule R2? Should we consider that in the presence of new required approvals, R2 should measure the time window relative to the new approval? Possibly yes, because the new required approval is necessary for valid execution of subsequent process. Therefore, logically the timeline should be: Last required approval would be the new Manager Approval (event 8), and then ship goods must occur within 2 days after that for case to be compliant if it was done prior to new manager approval? But new manager approval is the one that resets the process. But then R2 is not satisfied because no specification says as soon as new Manager Approval occurs, processing events must complete within 2 days. But note that if new Manager Approval has not occurred until event 8, then the ship goods event (03-05) is before event 8. So rule R2 might be assessed from the initial process, making it appear compliant.

However, the intended reading is that the rules are independent and both must be satisfied; they are not mutually exclusive. If after a change request, the required steps become re-sequenced, then the ship goods event cannot be retroactively considered a further processing step if it happened before obtaining the new manager approval. And if rule R5 requires a new Manager Approval to be obtained before any further processing step, then when a change request is triggered, the remaining processing steps should only start after that new Manager Approval, meaning that the deadlines in R2 should be measured from that new approval. But then ship goods did proceed too early. Wait, I'm confused.

I need to consider if there is any possibility that the timeline "within 2 calendar days" in R2 is measured relative to the last approval that was obtained BEFORE shipping, disregarding the new requirement? The ordering of events: Create_PO, Manager Approval, Finance Approval, Change_Request, then Ship_Goods, then receive goods, then Pay Invoice, then new Manager Approval, then Store Goods, then Archive. In such a process, the original required approvals might be overridden because of the rule R5 trigger. But I strongly lean that rule R5 is meant to override the acceptance by earlier approvals. That is typically the notion in change management: if you change something after approval, then a new approval is needed to validate the new process conditions.

I need to check the exact wording: "a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." That means that after change request becomes part of the process, all subsequent steps must be executed only after a new Manager Approval has been provided. But, wait, what qualifies as a "prior approval"? Does the change request retroactively "invalidate" the previous approvals so they no longer count for subsequent time thresholds? The implication is that the process is revalidated to current conditions. Under that logic, for R2, the time measurement should be from the new approval that the process requires. That is consistent with the need for the additional manager approval. So if that is the interpretation, then the effective timeline is: new required approval must occur before any further processing (like Ship_Goods) and then ship goods must occur within 2 days of that new manager approval. Let me check timeline: New manager approval (which is required after change request) occurs at event 8 on 03-07 15:10. Then the R2 requirement expects that ship goods must occur by 03-09 15:10. But in the actual trace, Ship_Goods happens before event 8 (03-05 10:26), which is even earlier than that window. So that is a violation of R2 if we strictly assume that the new approval is mandatory before any processing. But maybe the intended reading of R5 is that the new Manager Approval must occur only before not every further processing step, but perhaps only before some steps, maybe not Ship_Goods? But the phrase "before any further processing step" suggests before executing any subsequent processing activity after a change request.

Alternative view: When expedited flag is true, the inventory shipment may be triggered by the initial approval process regardless of changes. But R5 clearly says that if a change request happens after any approval, the purchase order must undergo new manager approval before processing any further step. If we accept that interpretation, step after change request is ship goods, but they did ship goods without new manager approval. So that's an undeniable violation of R5.

When assessing rule R2, is it possible that the last required approval is considered as the one that exists at the time of shipping? Let's try to evaluate if there is an "approval layering": The initial required approvals (manager & finance) should not be overridden by a change request, unless the new manager approval is specifically mentioned. Actually, R5 says: "if a Change_Request happens after any approval" but it does not say "after the final approval" but "after any approval." Even if only one approval had happened, and then a change request, then you need new approval before further processing. In our trace, a new approval is required after change request from Finance Approval as well, even though the PO already had two approvals. But the wording "after any approval" means if the PO has any previous approval, then if there's a change request, not the sequence is not invalidated until further processing is executed. But rule states MUST obtain new manager approval before any further processing step. And Ship_Goods is a further processing step. Therefore, rule R5 is violated because new manager approval did not occur before Ship_Goods.

Now R2, how to judge it? In the absence of the new manager approval, do we consider the preexisting multiple approvals? The rule doesn't mention changes in the approvals triggered by a change request; it just says "last required approval" with no condition on its recency or revision. But the process of applying rules to an event trace: Do we check R5 violation for Ship_Goods's execution after change? Yes, and the time gap for R2: "within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." But if we still consider the last original required approval (Finance Approval event occurred at 2025-03-04 08:17) as the last required approval for the transaction, then the starting time for the 2-day period would be 2025-03-04 08:17. Are there any conditions in R2 about change requests? No. So if we use that, then Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 10:26 occurs within 2 days of 2025-03-04 08:17, so that is compliant with rule R2. But then rule R2 in conjunction with R5 - if R5 makes the new manager approval mandatory then all further processing steps including Ship_Goods should occur after new manager approval, but if we evaluate R2 based solely on the original process, then at the time of shipping, perhaps the process didn't require the new approval if it was not triggered? But rule R1 was already satisfied by the original approvals, but generally change request invalidates those approvals. And then R5 says: "if a change_request happens after any approval", then the new manager approval is mandatory. So by rule R5, shipping should be held up till new manager approval. But then rule R2 should be interpreted in light of that. In any case, because rule R5 is clearly violated, it doesn't matter whether R2 is considered in isolation. But I need to answer each rule individually, with their compliant/violated status and a justification no more than 20 words.

Let's evaluate each rule individually:

R1: "Any purchase order with total_amount > €10 000 must have Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval." Conditions: Purchase order is €12,450 so condition triggered. The event trace shows Manager Approval (Mar 03, 11:05) followed by Finance Approval (Mar 04, 08:17). So rule R1 appears compliant based solely on R1's criteria. But wait, then there's a Change Request event occurs after Finance Approval, but R1 does not seem to say anything about change requests. About after change request, it might invalidate the approach. But the wording "must have Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval" means that prior to any subsequent processing step if a change request event happens. But the rule text does not mention order or changes after that; it's simply a statement that "any purchase order" etc. is processed: the PO came in, then first manager approval, then finance approval; so rule R1 is satisfied. So R1: Compliant.

I'll state: "Compliant. Purchase order amount is over €10,000, and Manager Approval and Finance Approval occurred sequentially." But it might be argued that the sequence is correct. I'll mention that.

Now R2: "If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." Let's see: The event trace: Expedited true. The last required approval event in the traditional sense given the process (if we ignore R5's modification) would be the Finance Approval at 2025-03-04 08:17. Then the ship goods event is on 2025-03-05 10:26 which is one day and a couple hours later, so that's clearly within 2 days. But wait: Should we disregard the change request that happens on 2025-03-04 15:42? Because then according to rule R5, the process should get a new Manager Approval before further shipping; otherwise, the initial approvals are no longer valid. But rule R2 did not include a clause for new approvals. But if we adopt a consistent view that once a change request is raised, the new manager approval is needed, then the last required approval should be the new manager approval, but new manager approval occurs on 2025-03-07 15:10, which then implies that shipping should occur after that if measured from that last required approval. But actually, the rule may be simply "if a PO is expedited, ensure that after the final required approval (which is not necessarily the latest approval executed, but the approval required for the PO that is in effect at the time shipping is processed) shipping is executed in a timely manner." I must decide. However, rule R2 is ambiguous in presence of R5. But I think the intention is that events following a change request (like process repositions) must consider the new approval requirements. So the required approvals after change requests become: The new Manager Approval event is necessary to meet R5's requirement to process further steps. Then rule R2's "last required approval" would then be new Manager Approval eventually. And its time for Ship_Goods execution should be measured from that event, so shipping event should have occurred within 2 days of the new Manager Approval event. But since the new manager approval event (event 8) on 2025-03-07 is well after the ship goods event (2025-03-05 in event 5), then rule R2 in that proper sequence becomes violated if we interpret that way.

Which interpretation is more likely? Let me check the ordering: R1 and R2 are baseline; R5 is an exceptional rule triggered by a change request. Common auditing processes: A change request automatically invalidates previous approvals, and the approval process must be restarted. Therefore, after a change request, the earlier approvals are no longer valid for further processing steps (like shipping). And rule R5 says: "before any further processing step." So therefore, if a change request happens and there is a step after, that step violates the rule R5 if new manager approval is not obtained. Additionally, thus rule R2 should measure its 2-day window from the last required approval at the time shipping occurs. So for shipping, it should have been done within 2 days after the new Manager Approval, not the original approvals. The order in the trace: 03-04 15:42 change request; then shipping event 03-05 10:26; then new Manager Approval (event 8) on 03-07 15:10. So shipping happened 2+ days after change_request? Let’s measure: The new approval event is scheduled, but it did not occur before shipping. So rule R2 is not satisfied because the shipping is done too quickly after the change request (but there's new manager approval delay). But wait, is there possibility that shipping event is considered as a processing step that was initiated before noticing the change request? Possibly rule R5 is more explicit that a new manager approval must be obtained before any further processing step. Which processing step occurred first? After change request, first processing step after 03-04 15:42 should have been a new manager approval. But instead, shipping occurred. That violates rule R5. And indirectly, if we consider the main requirement for timely shipping in an expedited order (the expedited check), the condition now should become "within 2 days after new manager approval" after a change request. But if shipping occurred before new manager approval, then it is also violating this expedited shipping condition for change request orders. I lean that rule R2, in context of a change request, is also violated because the shipping was done prior to obtaining the necessary new approval as per rule R5. But I'm not 100% sure. I can mention "Ship_Goods occurred outside valid 2-day window relative to new approval required after change_request" maybe in the justification for R2 as long as I mention "New manager approval not obtained before shipping; also shipping happened before the new required approval event." Let me think carefully: Rule R2 doesn't mention new manager approval, but rule R5 does. But can we use rule R5 to invalidate rule R2 if the order is expedited? I lean that R2 is "Violated" because of the disregard for the new required approval post-change request induced by rule R5.

I'll produce: R2: Violated. Justification: "Expedited order change triggered required new approval post-change; shipping occurred too late (pre-new approval) within the subsequent 2-day window would be required."

But I need to not exceed 20 words interpretation in justification for each rule.

For R2: I'll produce something like "Expedited flag true; Ship_Goods happened before obtaining new Manager Approval after change_request, violating 2-day window requirement." But is that within 20 words? I'll try: "Violation: Expedited PO had change request; shipping occurred before new Manager_Approval, exceeding mandated 2-day window post new required approval." That might be 20 words or less? Let me count roughly: "Expedited PO change triggered; shipping occurred pre-new approval, breaching the 2-day window requirement." Count words: that's: "Expedited PO change triggered; shipping occurred pre-new approval, breaching 2-day window requirement." That's 14 words maybe, but I'll just try to be succinct.

Alternatively, I can check the timeline: By strictly comparing initial approvals: The "last required approval" if we ignore rule R5 would be finance approval at 03-04 08:17, and then ship goods at 03-05 10:26 is within two days, so solely for rule R2 it would be Compliant. But then rule R5 which says that after a change request, new manager approval must occur for further processing. Given rule R5 is violated (as we'll call it later), then by that token, the intended baseline to measure rule R2's time is likely the new manager approval. However, what if the intermediary processing step violates multiple rules and we can't have it be considered compliant relative to non-updated approvals? The instructions generally say to examine compliance rules R1-R6 and then give a verdict "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT" for overall process. I suspect that the intended purpose is to find multiple violations: specifically, violation of R3 (Pay Invoice occurs before receiving goods), violation of R5 (No new Manager Approval before further processing after change request, such as Ship_Goods) and violation of R2 if interpreted in light of R5. However, if we try to clarify which ones are violated: 
- R3 is clearly violated because Pay Invoice event (03-06 09:00) occurred before Receive Goods event (03-07 14:13). That clearly violates temporal order.
- Also R5 is violated because after change request at 03-04 15:42, processing step Ship Goods occurred at 03-05 10:26, which is earlier than new Manager Approval on 03-07 15:10.

Now what about R2: "ex-CRS required to have Ship_Goods 2 days after last required approval." When order is expedited, one expects that the process is more time-sensitive. Rule R2 intended to catch delays in theshipment step after approvals have been granted (if no change request). But if a change request has occurred, then rule R5 implies that all further processing must occur only after new manager approval. So the intended sequence is: Any further processing after the change request (i.e., subsequent to the change request's timing) must be validated by new manager approval and then happen timely thereafter. In our sequence, Ship_Goods happens even before new manager approval, so what should be reset value for "last required approval"? For a change-requested expedited order, the "last required approval" for final processing should be the new manager approval that had to be obtained. But here, no new manager approval occurred before shipping. That definitely violates the expectation that the shipping event should occur soon after the new approval. Therefore, rule R2 is violated if we interpret it in the correct sequence: because the necessary approval hasn't been done yet by the time shipping happened. Also, even if we don't consider the new requirement, shipping is validating with finance approval. But wait, it might be ambiguous: maybe rule R5 isn't considered part of the expedited timeline in R2. But I lean that a change request invalidates prior approvals, so new manager approval must be obtained before any further processing step. In our case, shipping occurred before that. So R2 (based on the proper interpretation of R5 trigger) is violated.

I need also check: Has a new Manager Approval occurred somewhere else? We see two Manager Approval events: one on Mar 03 (and one on Mar 07). Which one is counted as the one required for processing after change request? I wonder if the initial manager approval counts if no change request occurred before shipping. But a new change occurred at 03-04 15:42. The rule states "if a change_request happens after any approval." This means that if any approval event happened before the change request event, then that triggers a need for a new manager approval before any further processing. And that applies regardless if some processing happened in between change request and the new approval. So, indeed, shipping (which is a processing step after change request) should not occur until it has a new manager approval. The real timeline: 
- After change_request, the process is waiting for new manager approval. But shipping did not wait: it happened earlier (03-05 10:26) than the new manager approval (03-07 15:10). Therefore, rule R5 is violated. And as a domino effect, the time window for shipping in R2 relative to new manager approval is violated.

I want to double-check if I should mark R2 as Violated. I'm not 100% sure because one interpretation of R2 might ignore the effect of a change request if not explicitly stated. But rule R5 explicitly states that if a change_request happens after any approval, the purchase order must get a new manager approval before any further processing. That "any further processing" includes ship goods. Therefore, rule R2, if applied after a change request, should be based on the new manager approval after change request, not preceding approvals. And because the new manager approval did not occur before ship goods, rule R2 is violated in that reading. I check the wording carefully:

1. R5: "If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." 
2. R2: "If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval." 

Given that a new Manager_Approval is required by R5 after a change request (which is part of 'any approval' condition), then the last required approval, had a new approval been granted (which must then satisfy the 2-day condition in R2), is the one before shipping. And because the shipping is done before new approval, the time measurement is taken from what? Possibly, with rule R5, the processing effectively hasn't reached the approve phase, so R2 might not be applicable as a condition because further processing didn't occur after a valid approval. That might be seen as a violation: you didn't complete the new required approval before shipping, so R2's condition becomes impossible to satisfy, so I'd again mark it as "violated".

So I'll mark:
R1: Compliant.
R2: Violated, with justification: "Expedited order: Shipping occurred before the mandated new Manager Approval after change request, breaching 2-day rule."
R3: Violated because "Pay_Invoice occurred before Receive_Goods."
R4: Not Applicable because hazardous=false.
R5: Violated because "Change_Request triggered necessitating new Manager_Approval, which occurred after further processing (ship goods)."
R6: Compliant because process terminates with Archive_Record.

Now let me check R6: Archive_Record event is present, so R6 is compliant.

Double-check rule R3: "Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods." In our event order, Pay_Invoice is event 7 and occurs at 09:00 on 03-06, while Receive_Goods is event 6 and occurs at 14:13 on 03-07. So indeed, invoice payment happened before goods were received, so it's a violation.
Even though sometimes invoice payment might not travel according to R3 if processed asynchronously, but rules explicitly state "must never occur before" so it's a violation.

Double-check if any other radiations: Possibly pay invoice creation, shipping and order tasks sequence, but rule R3 is clearly violated.

Thus final results: 
- R1: COMPLIANT. "Total above €10000, manager then finance approval occurred sequentially."
- R2: I need to decide: Given new approval required, shipping event occurs too early relative to that new required approval, violating rule. But possibility "exhedited" violation: "Ship_Goods should have taken place after obtaining a new manager approval and within 2 days of it. That did not happen."
Thus I'll mark R2 as "Violated".
- R3: Violated with the justification "Pay_Invoice happened before Receive_Goods."
- R4: Not applicable because hazardous is false.
- R5: Violated, because after a change request, none new manager approval occurred before processing, especially before ship goods.
- R6: Compliant because Archive_Record event present.

The overall result: Because R2, R3, and R5 are Violated, the case is NON-COMPLIANT.

I must produce answer in the required answer format. Format: 
I'll list each rule: Rule, then decision, then justification no more than 20 words, like "Rule R1: Compliant - Reason." Then final overall result must be "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".

I must produce answer in a plain text answer with no markdown formatting (by default, not added Markdown formatting unless requested) but as text.

I'll produce:
"R1: Compliant. PO exceeds €10,000; sequential Manager and Finance approvals occurred." (with ≤20 words).
- R2: Violated. Because expedited attribute demanded shipping post new required approval; shipment occurred before change-request mandated new Manager Approval, breaching the 2-day window. I'll then write: "R2: Violated. Expedited order change invalidates previous approvals; shipping occurred without timely new Manager Approval (beyond 2-day post-change)." But I must compose a 20 word sentence.

R2 justification: We need a 20-word max sentence. Possibly: "Expedited order and change request necessitated a new Manager Approval before shipping; however, shipping was executed before that, violating the 2-day rule." That sentence might be 20 words or so, count words: Expedited(1), order(2), and change request(3) necessitated new Manager Approval(6) before shipping(7) however shipping(9) was executed(10) before that(11) violating(12) the 2-day rule= actually 12 words. I'll check: "Expedited PO with change triggered need for new Manager Approval before shipping; however, shipping processed pre-new approval, breaching 2-day requirement." Let me count: "Expedited PO" 2, "with" 3, "change triggered" 5, "need for new Manager Approval" 9, "before shipping;" 11, "however, shipping processed pre-new approval," 21? That's too long.
Maybe I'll try: "Expedited order's change required new Manager Approval before shipping; instead, shipping occurred too early, failing the 2-day limit." That is <= 21 maybe. I'll re-read: "Expedited order's change required new Manager Approval before further processing; shipping executed too early, breaching the 2-day window." Let's count: "Expedited (1) order's (2) change (3) required (4) new (5) Manager (6) Approval (7) before (8) further (9) processing; (10) shipping (11) executed (12) too (13) early, (14) breaching (15) the (16) 2-day (17) window." That's 17 words. I must try to shorten further if there is a chance.

I want to adjust consistently.

For R3: "Violated. Invoice paid on 03-06, before receipt on 03-07, contrary to rule order." That is around 16 words. I'll check: "Invoice paid on 03-06, but goods received on 03-07, violating order." That is 11 words. I'll produce something like "Violated. Pay_Invoice was processed before Receive_Goods, in breach of rule order."

For R4: "Not Applicable. Hazard condition false; safety inspection not required." Count: Not applicable message is fewer than 20 words.

For R5: "Violated. After a change request, a new Manager_Approval was required before further processing (Shipping), which did not occur; breach of rule." Count words "After change request, new Manager Approval mandatory before further processing; yet shipping occurred without it, violating new approval requirement." That may be too many words.

I'll produce a shorter version: "Violated. Change triggered new Manager Approval requirement; shipping occurred without it, violating processing order." Count words: Violated. (1) Change (2) triggered (3) new (4) Manager (5) Approval (6) requirement; (7) shipping (8) occurred (9) without (10) it, (11) violating (12) processing (13) order. That's 13 words.

For R6: "Compliant. Process ended with Archive_Record, fulfilling final step."

Now overall result: "NON-COMPLIANT."

The answer format: It doesn't specify bullet points but maybe a structured answer line-by-line.

Might produce:
"R1: Compliant. PO €12,450 > €10,000; sequential Manager and Finance Approvals occurred.
R2: Violated. Expedited change necessitated new Manager Approval pre-launch; shipping occurred early, breaching 2-day window.
R3: Violated. Pay_Invoice processed on 03-06 before Goods receipt on 03-07, contrary to allowed order.
R4: Not Applicable. Hazard flagged false; no safety inspection required.
R5: Violated. After change request on 03-04, a new Manager Approval was mandatory before further processing; Ship_Goods executed on 03-05, violating rule.
R6: Compliant. Archive_Record present concludes process."

"Overall: NON-COMPLIANT."

I must output with exact structure "R1: ...", "R2: ..." etc. The user's question: "Follow the required answer format." Possibly bullet each rule and then final overall conclusion.

I must produce answer in text that is plain text, no markdown formatting I think.

I'll produce final answer text accordingly.

I need to check if possible alternative or if I need to include event trace events justifications. Possibly include events with timestamp justification. But the instructions say "Follow the required answer format: For each rule: Compliant, Violated, or Not Applicable, followed by ≤20-word justification." So I'll produce our justified lines for R1, R2, ... R6, then overall result: COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT. We must produce "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT" in all caps at the end. Possibly as "Overall: NON-COMPLIANT". But answer format might be something like: "R1: Compliant – Justification" on separate lines. I'll produce exactly that.

I must check if any possibility regarding rule R2: There is an ambiguity: some might only judge it on pre-change approval (since change didn't invalidate shipping) if the change request is not supposed to stop further processing. But then rule R5 in conflict because it clearly states new Manager Approval must precede any following step. And rule R5's violation is clear because after change, new Manager Approval event (event 8) occurred but it did not occur before ship goods, so rule R5 is violated.

I need to decide: Different interpretations of rule R2 could be: If no requirement for new manager approval, then R2 might be considered as "compliant" because ship goods occurred within 2 days after finance approval (01 day, 2 hours later approx) if measured relative to the last of the original required approvals: manager and finance. But then rule R5 is already violated. But if I consider the overall order, since a change request occurred after finance approval, then additional approval is triggered and necessary for processing. But if we ignore the chain, then ship goods happened after finance approval from day 04 to day 05 is within 2 days from Finance Approval. So that would mean R2 remains compliant if we consider the original approvals? But then rule R5 would be violated because how can that be? I suspect that the logical chain should be that the change request invalidates earlier approvals. And if rule R2 is read as "based on last actual acceptance of the order" then if a change request event occurs, the accepted approvals should be re-established. Therefore, starting from the change request, the shipping should occur only after the new approval, and thus shipping must occur within 2 days after new approval event (which in our case must come after shipping so it doesn't count). But then, in that case, if shipping happens before new approval, then rule R2 cannot even be applied because there is no "last required approval." The implication is that without new manager approval after a change request, any subsequent processing step (including shipping) is non-compliant. So I lean to mark R2 as violated because the proper timeline for post-change processing was not adhered to.

Thus I'll produce: 
R1: Compliant. 
R2: Violated. 
R3: Violated. 
R4: Not Applicable. 
R5: Violated. 
R6: Compliant.

Then overall result NON-COMPLIANT.

I need to produce a final answer in required answer format. I'll produce final answer as text lines like:

"Rule R1: compliant. [Justification]. 
Rule R2: violated. [Justification]. 
... etc."
Then overall result: "NON-COMPLIANT".

I will produce answer accordingly.

I must produce text answer will be plain text.

I must produce no markdown formatting.

I must produce answer exactly following instructions.

I'll produce: 
"R1: Compliant. Purchase order exceeds €10 000 and sequential approvals (Manager then Finance) occurred." – maybe short version.
"R2: Violated. Expedited order required processing after new approval post-change; Ship_Goods occurred too early, violating 2-day window." 
"R3: Violated. Pay_Invoice occurred (03-06) before Receive_Goods (03-07), contrary to requirement." 
"R4: Not Applicable. Hazardous flag false; safety inspection not applicable." 
"R5: Violated. Change_Request triggered requirement for new Manager_Approval before further processing; Ship_Goods executed without it."
"R6: Compliant. Archive_Record event present, closing process."

"Overall: NON-COMPLIANT."

I must check word count for each justification is <= 20 words.
Let me count R1: "Purchase order exceeds €10 000 and sequential approvals (Manager then Finance) occurred." Actually count words: "Purchase (1) order (2) exceeds (3) €10 000 (4) and (5) sequential (6) approvals (7) (Manager (8) then (9) Finance) (10) occurred (11)." That's 11 words.

R2: "Expedited order required processing after new approval post-change; Ship_Goods executed too early, violating 2-day rule." Count: "Expedited(1) order(2) required(3) processing(4) after(5) new(6) approval(7) post-change;(8) Ship_Goods(9) executed(10) too(11) early,(12) violating(13) 2-day(14) rule." That is 14 words, which is acceptable.

R3: "Pay_Invoice executed on 03-06 before goods received on 03-07; contravenes required order." Count words: "Pay_Invoice(1) executed(2) on(3) 03-06(4) before(5) goods(6) received(7) on(8) 03-07(9); contravenes(10) required(11) order(12)." That is 12 words.

R4: "Hazard flag false; no Safety_Inspection required because order is non-hazardous." Count words: "Hazard(1) flag(2) false;(3) no(4) Safety_Inspection(5) required(6) because(7) order(8) is(9) non-hazardous." That is 9 words.

R5: "Change triggered new Manager_Approval requirement for further processing; Ship_Goods processed without it, violating rule." That's: "Change(1) triggered(2) new(3) Manager_...(3?) Actually I must check carefully: "Change triggered" (2) new (3) Manager Approval (5) requirement (6) for (7) further (8) processing(9); Ship_Goods(10) processed(11) without(12) it (13) violating (14) rule(15)." 15 words, OK.

R6: "Archive_Record event present, properly concluding process." Counts: Archive_Record(1) event(2) present,(3) properly(4) concluding(5) process(6). OK.

Then overall: "NON-COMPLIANT." 
I'll produce final answer accordingly.

I'll now produce final answer in plain text with no markdown formatting.R1: Compliant. Purchase order exceeds €10 000 and sequential Manager and Finance approvals occurred.
R2: Violated. Expedited change required new Manager Approval pre‐processing; shipping ran before it and missed the 2‐day window.
R3: Violated. Pay_Invoice processed on 03-06 before Goods receipt on 03-07, breaking the required order.
R4: Not Applicable. Order is non‐hazardous; no Safety Inspections needed.
R5: Violated. After a Change_Request, processing should await a new Manager Approval, yet Ship_Goods occurred too early.
R6: Compliant. Process ended with Archive_Record, meeting the final step requirement.

Overall: NON-COMPLIANT.
