The fact is **not accurate** based on the provided event-log fragment.

**Justification:**
- In **Case 1001**, "Update_Inventory" occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund" (timestamps 08:25:55 and 08:30:02, respectively).
- In **Case 1002**, "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all before "Authorize_Refund."
- In **Case 1003**, "Update_Inventory" occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund" (timestamps 10:08:07 and 10:15:42, respectively).

The data shows that "Authorize_Refund" does **not** consistently occur immediately before "Update_Inventory." The claim is incorrect.
