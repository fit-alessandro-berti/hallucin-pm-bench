The requested value **cannot be derived** from the provided data. 

**Explanation:**  
To compute the average cycle time for the activity “Review Contract,” we would need to know the start and end timestamps for each occurrence of that activity within each case. The log only provides the activity name and a unique case ID per row; it does not include any time-related information (e.g., timestamps). Without timestamps, we cannot determine how long each “Review Contract” activity took to complete in its context, nor can we aggregate durations across cases to compute an average cycle time. 

Thus, the average cycle time for “Review Contract” **cannot be calculated from the given log data**.
