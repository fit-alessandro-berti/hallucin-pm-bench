1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.
2. The percentage of all logged events that this represents is **5.56%** (1 out of 18 events).
3. The case identifier that contains **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** is **A1002**.
4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:
   - **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 18 events, which is too small to generalize to a monthly frequency.
   - **Short time window**: The data covers only a single day (May 1, 2025), which may not reflect typical monthly variations in fraud checks.
