As a senior process-mining analyst, here are the answers based strictly on the provided XES log excerpt:

**1. How many times does the activity “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” occur in the excerpt?**

The activity **"Manual\_Fraud\_Check"** occurs **1** time (in Case C05).

**2. What percentage of**
**a) all *events**\* **and**
**b) all *unique cases**\* **(12 in total)**
**include that activity? Round to two decimals.**

a) **Percentage of all events:**
*   Total events: 48
*   Events with "Manual\_Fraud\_Check": 1
*   Percentage: $(1 / 48) \times 100 \approx 2.08\%$

b) **Percentage of all unique cases (12 in total):**
*   Total cases: 12
*   Cases including "Manual\_Fraud\_Check": 1 (C05)
*   Percentage: $(1 / 12) \times 100 \approx 8.33\%$

**3. In ≤100 words, explain why such a low-support activity can mislead performance or predictive analyses if we generalise from this slice.**

This low-support activity ("Manual\_Fraud\_Check") represents a rare path in the process (only 8.33% of cases). Generalizing from this small sample (a "slice") will lead to biased performance metrics, as the typical process flow is significantly faster without this manual step. In predictive analysis, models trained solely on this data slice will be overfit to the common path, failing to accurately predict the increased latency and resource usage associated with the critical, but infrequent, manual intervention.
