Non-compliant  
1. Rule 2 requires that if the `Expedite_Flag` activity is present, the `Quality_Check` activity must occur before `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Quality_Check` (activity 7) appears after `Ship_Goods` (activity 8), violating the order requirement.
2. Additionally, while not directly fatal, the trace includes the `CFO` (activity 3) followed by an `Intern` (activity 7) with an intervening activity (activity 4: Expedite_Flag and activity 5: Issue_PO), but the direct-following prohibition (rule 4) is not violated in this case since there are two activities in between. However, the first violation in point 1 is sufficient to render the trace non-compliant.
