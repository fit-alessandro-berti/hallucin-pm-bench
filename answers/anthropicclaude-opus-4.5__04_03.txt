**No**

**Justification:**

| Rule | Satisfied/Violated | Analysis |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| **Rule 1** | **Violated** | QE and RA must occur "once each and **in that order**." In the trace, QE occurs before RA ✓, but `Notify_Authorities` intervenes between them. More critically, the rule requires QE→RA ordering, which is technically present, but the sequence is disrupted by NA occurring prematurely (see Rule 3). |
| **Rule 2** | Satisfied | Since severity = "High", VP must occur after both QE and RA. In the trace, VP_Safety_Approval occurs after both QE and RA. ✓ |
| **Rule 3** | **Violated** | `Notify_Authorities` must **not occur until after** both QE **and** RA are complete. In the trace, NA occurs *after* QE but *before* RA. This is a clear violation. |
| **Rule 4** | Satisfied | `Close_Case` occurs after NA and after VP (required for High severity). ✓ |

**Primary Violation:** Rule 3 – `Notify_Authorities` was executed before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` was complete.
