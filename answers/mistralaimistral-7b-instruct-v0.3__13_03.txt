 1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs twice in this excerpt, at CaseID 1002 and 1002.

2️⃣ An analyst who sees only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks in the full month-long log because this excerpt only represents a small portion of the total data. The analyst can't determine if these two instances are representative of the entire month or if they are outliers. For a more accurate estimation, the analyst would need to analyze the entire log for the month of March 2025.
