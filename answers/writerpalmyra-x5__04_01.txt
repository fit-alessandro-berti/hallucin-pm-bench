1. The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, requiring two approvals before `Issue_PO`. The trace shows `Approve_PO` by Procurement_Officer (event 2) and `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO (event 3), both occurring before `Issue_PO` (event 5) – satisfying Rule 1.

2. The `Expedite_Flag` is present (event 4), making `Quality_Check` optional and requiring `Risk_Assessment` before the first `Ship_Goods`. Although `Quality_Check` is not performed, it is correctly omitted due to the flag. `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurs after `Ship_Goods` (event 8), which appears to violate Rule 2 – but only if `Risk_Assessment` is not before `Ship_Goods`. However, upon correct ordering, `Ship_Goods` is at event 8 and `Risk_Assessment` at event 9: this violates the requirement that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** `Ship_Goods`. Therefore, this is **Non-compliant** under Rule 2.

Correction:

Non-compliant

2. Rule 2 states that when `Expedite_Flag` is present, `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Expedite_Flag` occurs at event 4, but `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) happens **after** `Ship_Goods` (event 8), violating this requirement.

(Note: Events are timestamp-ordered, so the sequence is validly interpreted. The violation is clear.)

Final answer: Non-compliant

2. Rule 2 is violated: `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurs after `Ship_Goods` (event 8), but must occur before it when `Expedite_Flag` is present.
