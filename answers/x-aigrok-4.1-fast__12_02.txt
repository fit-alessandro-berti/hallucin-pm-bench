**No**

The fact is inaccurate because line 6 shows case C003 executing *Validate_Payment* at 2025-02-01T10:43:00Z, which precedes the *Receive_Order* for the same case C003 at line 7 (2025-02-01T10:45:00Z). Thus, *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* within the same case, violating the claim. While other instances (e.g., C001 lines 1-2, C002 lines 3-5, C004 lines 8-9) follow the stated order, the counterexample in C003 disproves the universal "always" assertion.
