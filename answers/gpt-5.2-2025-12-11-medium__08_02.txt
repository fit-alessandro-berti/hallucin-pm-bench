**Answer 1:** **Yes.**

**Answer 2 (bonus):** T5 can be enabled without firing T3, because **P5** can be produced via the **P1-branch** (T2→T7→T4) while the token in **P2** is kept for T5. After T1, you have tokens in **P1 and P2**. Fire **T2** and **T7** to move the P1-token to **P4**, then **T4** to get **P5**. Now **P2 and P5** are both marked, so **T5** is enabled and may fire, even if **T3** never fired.

Minimal sequence: **[T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]**
