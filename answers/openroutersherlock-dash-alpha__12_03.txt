**No**

**Justification:**  
The FACT is inaccurate. Counterexamples exist where "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between:  
- **C001**: Receive_Order (09:12:00) → Validate_Payment (09:15:00) → Pack_Items (10:00:00). "Validate_Payment" is immediate after "Receive_Order" here.  
- **C002**: Receive_Order (09:30:00) → Pack_Items (09:50:00) → Validate_Payment (10:05:00). "Pack_Items" intervenes between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".  
- **C004**: Receive_Order (10:05:00) → Check_Fraud (10:07:00) → Validate_Payment (10:20:00). "Check_Fraud" intervenes between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".
