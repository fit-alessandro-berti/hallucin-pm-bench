**No.**

The claim is inaccurate because the log contains a clear counterexample: **case C003** (lines 6–7) shows *Validate_Payment* occurring **before** *Receive_Order* (line 6 at 10:43:00Z vs. line 7 at 10:45:00Z). While most cases (C001, C002, C004) follow the *Receive_Order → Validate_Payment* sequence, this exception disproves the absolute claim. Additionally, the fragment lacks a *Receive_Order* event for case C005 (lines 11–12), where *Validate_Payment* is the only recorded activity before cancellation, further undermining the "always follows" assertion. The log thus demonstrates variability in the order of these activities.
