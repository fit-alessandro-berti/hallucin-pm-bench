In the event log, the fact is inaccurate because there are cases where Validate_Payment does not follow Receive_Order. For instance, in case C003 (lines 6 and 7), Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order. Similarly, for case C005 (line 11), Validate_Payment happens without any preceding Receive_Order in the log. These examples demonstrate that Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order across all cases.
