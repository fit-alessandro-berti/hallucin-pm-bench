# Executive Memo: Claims Handling Performance Analysis Q1-2025

## Key Performance Issues

**Request Documents** presents critical concerns:
* Extreme wait time (150 minutes) creates significant customer delays
* Highest rework rate (22%) indicates frequent document resubmission
* **Action**: Implement automated document checklist system to reduce rework and establish pre-emptive document requirements notification

**Review Documents** shows efficiency problems:
* Longest processing time (25 minutes) with high variability (9 minutes)
* Second highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) affecting customer satisfaction
* **Action**: Deploy AI-assisted document review tools to reduce processing time and standardize review quality

**Initial Assessment** creates early bottlenecks:
* Third highest wait time (18 minutes) impacts downstream activities
* Moderate SLA breach rate (3.2%) indicates capacity issues
* **Action**: Reallocate resources from high-throughput, low-wait activities (e.g., Register Claim) to reduce Initial Assessment backlog

These targeted interventions would address the most problematic activities, improving overall claims processing efficiency and customer experience.
