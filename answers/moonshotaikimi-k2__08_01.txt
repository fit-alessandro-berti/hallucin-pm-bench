Answer: **Yes**, it is possible.

Concrete firing sequence  
M₀=(1,0,0,0,0,0,0)  
T1 fires ⇒ M₁=(0,1,1,0,0,0,0)  
T2 fires ⇒ M₂=(0,0,1,1,0,0,0)

In M₂ we have  
• a token in p3 (needed for T5),  
• still no token in p4, so the inhibitor arc is satisfied, and  
• no other places of T3 contain tokens, hence T3 is not yet activated.

T5 is now enabled, while T3 is not.  
Therefore T5 fires: M₃=(0,0,1,0,0,0,1) **before T3 ever fires**.
