1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in the excerpt.

3. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** is a low-support activity that occurs infrequently in the excerpt, occurring in only 1 out of 48 events and 1 out of 12 unique cases. Including this activity in performance or predictive analyses of the entire dataset can be misleading because its rare occurrence might skew the results, making the model overly sensitive to this low-support activity. Generalizing from this slice assumes that patterns observed here apply broadly, which might not hold if the activity is truly rare in the complete dataset. A more comprehensive understanding of the data, including a complete view of the entire event log, is necessary to make accurate conclusions.
