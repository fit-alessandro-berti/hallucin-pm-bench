No, the fact is not accurate.  

In case 1001, "Update_Inventory" occurs immediately before "Authorize_Refund". In case 1003, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Quality_Check" which then precedes "Authorize_Refund" (so "Authorize_Refund" is not immediately before "Update_Inventory"). Case 1002 lacks "Update_Inventory", so it is inconclusive for verifying the sequence there, but the data overall show the claim to be untrue.  

The "always" qualification fails due to the observed counterexamples in 1001 and 1003. No data support the claim.
