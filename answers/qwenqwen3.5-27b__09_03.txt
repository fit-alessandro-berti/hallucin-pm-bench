I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95 percent confidence interval for the activity Approve Invoice because Artefact A is an event-log stub where every row and timestamp value has been redacted, leaving only column headers without any usable data. Without specific start_time and complete_time values for instances of the Approve Invoice activity, it is mathematically impossible to calculate cycle times, standard deviations, or confidence intervals. Furthermore, Artefact B provides historical KPIs for the interval between Approve Invoice and Pay Invoice, which is a different metric than the cycle time of the Approve Invoice activity itself and cannot be used to derive the required statistics.
