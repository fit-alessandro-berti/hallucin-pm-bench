**Question 1:** No.

**Question 2:** T1 produces exactly one token in P2. Both T3 and T5 require P2 as an input. Since P2 has no other incoming arcs, this token is never replenished. Consequently, T3 and T5 are in structural conflict (mutual exclusion). Firing T5 consumes the P2 token, permanently disabling T3. Therefore, no firing sequence exists where both transitions fire, making it impossible for T5 to fire before T3. Additionally, T3 is enabled immediately after T1, whereas T5 requires the longer path via T4, so T3 is always enabled before T5 can fire.
