**Answer 1:** No, **T5** cannot fire before **T3** in any reachable marking.

**Answer 2:** **T5** requires both **P2** and **P5** to be marked. **P5** is only produced by **T4**, which requires **P4** (produced by **T3**). Thus, **T3** must fire to enable **T4**, which in turn enables **T5**. No sequence skips **T3** before **T5**.

*Minimal sequence where **T5** fires after **T3**:* **T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 → T5**. **T3** must precede **T5** due to the dependency chain. (Word count: 60)
