1) The requested value cannot be derived.  
2) The event log provided does not contain any timestamp or elapsed-time data (which has been explicitly redacted), making it impossible to calculate durations or cycle times for any activity. The historical benchmark data is unrelated to this log, applies to a different customer segment, and does not include information on “Review Contract” durations.
