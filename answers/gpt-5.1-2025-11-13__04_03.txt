No.

- **Rule 1 (QE before RA, both once):** Violated. `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, but `Notify_Authorities` is executed in between; the rule requires the two reviews to occur in that order within the process, and the later rules assume both are completed before dependent steps.
- **Rule 2 (High severity ⇒ VP after QE and RA):** Satisfied. `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.
- **Rule 3 (NA only after QE and RA complete):** Violated. `Notify_Authorities` occurs immediately after QE and **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
- **Rule 4 (CC only after NA and, if required, VP):** Satisfied. `Close_Case` occurs after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
