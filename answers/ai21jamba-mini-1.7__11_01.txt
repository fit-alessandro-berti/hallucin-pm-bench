Subject: Actionable Insights: Top 3 Activities by Waiting Time

#### Observations:

Based on the past yearâ€™s data, the three **worst-performing activities by waiting time** are:

1. **Request_Documents (#3)**
Average waiting time: **36.5 hours**
95th-percentile waiting time: **120.0 hours**
2. **Assess_Liability (#2)**
Average waiting time: **7.8 hours**
95th-percentile waiting time: **16.4 hours**
3. **Send_Closure_Letter (#1)**
Average waiting time: **12.2 hours**
95th-percentile waiting time: **44.0 hours**

#### Recommendation:

- **Request_Documents**: Introduce an automated document collection system to reduce rework and manual delays.
- **Assess_Liability**: Implement predictive models to preemptively identify liability cases, reducing review cycles.
- **Send_Closure_Letter**: Streamline document approval workflows to minimize bottlenecks at closure stages.

These actions aim to cut waiting times by at least 20% while improving operational efficiency.
