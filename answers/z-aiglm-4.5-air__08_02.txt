**Answer to Question 1:** Yes.

**Answer to Question 2:** The minimal firing sequence is: **T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5**.

**Explanation:** For T5 to fire, it needs tokens in P2 and P5. P2 is produced by T1. P5 is produced by T4, which requires a token in P4. To get a token in P4 without firing T3, T7 must fire, which requires a token in P3 from T2. This sequence demonstrates that T5 can fire without T3 ever being enabled.
