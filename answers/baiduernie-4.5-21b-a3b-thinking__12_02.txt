The stated fact is not accurate because Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order in the log fragment. Specifically, for customer C003 (lines 6 and 7), Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order (at 10:43 and 10:45, respectively), violating the "always follows" claim. Additionally, for customer C005 (lines 11 and 12), Validate_Payment (at 12:00) has no preceding Receive_Order in the log, as C005 events begin with Validate_Payment. These counterexamples demonstrate that the relationship is not universal.
