1. **No**

2. **Justification:**  
   The event log contains counter-examples where other activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":  
   - **Case C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` (09:30:00) → `Pack_Items` (09:50:00) → `Validate_Payment` (10:05:00). Here, `Pack_Items` intervenes.  
   - **Case C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` (10:05:00) → `Check_Fraud` (10:07:00) → `Validate_Payment` (10:20:00). Here, `Check_Fraud` intervenes.  

   Since these activities do not occur immediately after "Receive_Order" in all cases, the FACT is inaccurate.
