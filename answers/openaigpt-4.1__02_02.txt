Let’s analyze the log step by step:

---

### Q1: How many **distinct cases** are present in this fragment?

Let's look for unique case codes:

- C001
- C002
- C003

**Answer:**
> **3**

---

### Q2: For case **“C002”**, list the **sequence of activities** in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).

Find all events with `case="C002"`, in log order:

- Line 2: Receive_Order
- Line 5: Check_Stock
- Line 8: Arrange_Delivery
- Line 10: Ship_Order

So:

**Answer:**
> **Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

---

### Q3: Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

For each "Ship_Order", find the event in the same case right before it:

- **C001**:  
  Events:  
    Line 1: Receive_Order  
    Line 3: Check_Stock  
    Line 7: Ship_Order  
  Predecessor: **Check_Stock**

- **C002**:  
  Events:  
    Line 2: Receive_Order  
    Line 5: Check_Stock  
    Line 8: Arrange_Delivery  
    Line 10: Ship_Order  
  Predecessor: **Arrange_Delivery**

- **C003**:  
  Events:  
    Line 4: Receive_Order  
    Line 6: Check_Stock  
    Line 9: Ship_Order  
  Predecessor: **Check_Stock**

Distinct activities:  
- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock

Alphabetically:

**Answer:**
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
