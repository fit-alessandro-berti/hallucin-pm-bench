### Answers Based Solely on Provided Log Fragment

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occur in this fragment?**  
   **Answer:** 1  
   *(Rationale: Explicitly listed once in case A1002 at 2025-05-01T10:50:00. No other instances appear.)*  

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
   **Answer:** 5.88%  
   *(Rationale: Total logged events = 17 (18 CSV lines minus header). Occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check" = 1. Percentage = (1 / 17) × 100 = 5.88235... → rounded to **5.88%**.)*  

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check".**  
   **Answer:** A1002  
   *(Rationale: Only case A1002 includes "Manual_Fraud_Check" (timestamp 2025-05-01T10:50:00). No other cases contain this activity.)*  

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Insufficient temporal coverage**: The fragment spans only a single day (2025-05-01), missing potential variations across days (e.g., weekends, business cycles, or monthly peaks), making it unrepresentative of a full month.  
   - **Critically small sample size**: With only 4 cases total (A1001–A1004) and 1 occurrence of the activity, the sample is too small to reliably estimate a rare event (high sampling error; e.g., ±49% margin of error at 95% confidence).
