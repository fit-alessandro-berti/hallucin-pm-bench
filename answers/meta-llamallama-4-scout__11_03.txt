The current process performance data indicates that certain activities are underperforming, breaching their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and exhibiting high waiting times. Based on the provided data, the three worst-performing activities are:

- Legal Approval, which has an SLA of 600 seconds but an average throughput time of 900 seconds, exceeding the SLA by 300 seconds, with an average waiting time of 600 seconds.
- Risk Review, with an SLA of 300 seconds, an average throughput time of 600 seconds, exceeding the SLA by 300 seconds, and an average waiting time of 480 seconds.
- Credit Assessment, with an SLA of 240 seconds, an average throughput time of 300 seconds, exceeding the SLA by 60 seconds, and an average waiting time of 200 seconds.

To improve performance:
• For Legal Approval, implement an automated document review system to reduce manual review time.
• For Risk Review, allocate additional reviewers to decrease the waiting time and expedite the review process.
• For Credit Assessment, streamline data collection and analysis by adopting more efficient software tools.
