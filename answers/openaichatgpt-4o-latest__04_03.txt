**Answer:** No

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1 (QE and RA once, in order):** ✅ Satisfied. Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occur once each and in the correct order.
  
- **Rule 2 (VP after QE and RA if severity = "High"):** ✅ Satisfied. `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.
  
- **Rule 3 (NA only after QE and RA):** ❌ Violated. `Notify_Authorities` occurs immediately after QE, but before RA. It must wait until both QE and RA are complete.
  
- **Rule 4 (CC only after NA and VP if needed):** ✅ Satisfied. `Close_Case` occurs after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval` (required due to high severity).

**Conclusion:** The trace violates Rule 3, hence it is **not compliant** with ruleset R.
