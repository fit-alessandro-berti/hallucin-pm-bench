Let's analyze the Petri net starting from \( M_0 = \{P_0\} \):

- \(T_1\) fires: consumes token from \(P_0\), produces tokens in \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) (AND-split).
- \(T_2\) fires: consumes token from \(P_1\), produces token in \(P_3\).
- \(T_7\) fires: consumes token from \(P_3\), produces token in \(P_4\).
- \(T_3\) fires: consumes token from \(P_2\), produces token in \(P_4\).
- \(T_4\) fires: consumes token from \(P_4\), produces token in \(P_5\).
- \(T_5\) fires: consumes tokens from \(P_2\) and \(P_5\), produces token in \(P_6\) (synchronizing join).

### Question 1: Is it possible for \(T_5\) to fire before \(T_3\)?

#### Analysis:
- \(T_5\) requires tokens at both \(P_2\) and \(P_5\).
- \(P_2\) starts with a token after \(T_1\).
- \(P_5\) only gets a token after \(T_4\) fires.
- \(T_4\) requires a token in \(P_4\).
- \(P_4\) can be produced by either \(T_3\) (from \(P_2\)) or \(T_7\) (from \(P_3\)).
- To produce \(P_5\), \(T_4\) must fire, meaning \(P_4\) must be marked first.
- However, \(P_4\) can be marked without firing \(T_3\) if \(T_7\) fires after \(T_2\).

Therefore,
- \(T_5\) can fire after \(P_2\) (present after \(T_1\)) and \(P_5\) (produced after \(T_4\)), which depends on \(P_4\) from either \(T_3\) or \(T_7\).
- If \(P_4\) is produced via \(T_7\) (i.e., along \(T_1 \to T_2 \to T_7\)), \(T_3\) need **not** fire.
- So, it is possible to fire \(T_5\) without firing \(T_3\), and hence \(T_5\) can fire before \(T_3\).

---

### Question 2 (bonus): Give a minimal firing sequence that fires \(T_5\) before \(T_3\).

**Minimal firing sequence:**

\[
\boxed{
T_1, T_2, T_7, T_4, T_5
}
\]

Explanation:  
- \(T_1\) produces tokens in \(P_1\) and \(P_2\).  
- \(T_2\) consumes \(P_1\), produces \(P_3\).  
- \(T_7\) consumes \(P_3\), produces \(P_4\).  
- \(T_4\) consumes \(P_4\), produces \(P_5\).  
- \(T_5\) consumes tokens in \(P_2\) and \(P_5\), firing successfully without \(T_3\) having fired.

---

**Summary:** \(T_5\) can fire before \(T_3\), as \(P_4\) (and thus \(P_5\)) can be produced via the path \(T_1 \to T_2 \to T_7\), bypassing \(T_3\). Hence, \(T_5\) does not depend on \(T_3\).
