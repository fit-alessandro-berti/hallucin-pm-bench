1) **Average cycle time of “Review Contract” (hours): _Cannot be derived from the data provided._**

2) **Why / how it would be calculated:**  
To compute an average cycle time for **“Review Contract”**, we would need either:
- **timestamps** (e.g., start/end times, or at least completion timestamps plus a way to infer start), or  
- an **elapsed-time/duration field per activity instance**.

The average would then be:

\[
\text{Avg cycle time}=\frac{\sum \text{duration of each “Review Contract” occurrence}}{\#\text{ of “Review Contract” occurrences}}
\]

In the excerpt shown, we can identify **4 occurrences** of “Review Contract” (C-001 to C-004), but **no timing/duration data is available** because timestamps and elapsed-time fields are redacted, so the durations (and thus the average in hours) cannot be calculated.
