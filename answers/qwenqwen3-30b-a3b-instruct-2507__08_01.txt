**Answer: Yes**, it **is possible** for transition **T5 to fire before T3**.

### ✅ **Firing Sequence from Initial Marking:**

Initial marking:  
`p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`

**Step 1:** Fire **T1**  
- T1 enabled (p0 has 1 token)
- Postcondition: p0 → 0, p1 → 1, p2 → 1  
Current marking:  
`p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`

**Step 2:** Fire **T5**  
- T5 requires: p3 ≥ 1 (normal arc) and p4 = 0 (inhibitor arc)  
- Currently, p3 = 0 → **T5 is NOT enabled** ❌  
→ **Cannot fire T5 yet.**

Wait — this suggests we cannot fire T5 before T3, but reconsider: we need to **avoid enabling T3 too early**.

But T3 requires p2 → p4, so we cannot fire T3 unless we fire T2 first (which requires p1 → p3).

So the problem is: **To fire T5, we need p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0**  
But **T5 cannot fire unless p3 has at least one token**  
→ p3 gets token **only via T2**, which fires only if **p1 has a token**

But **T1** gives token to both **p1 and p2**. So we can fire **T2** (p1 → p3), and then **T5** could possibly fire **if p4 is empty**.

But if we fire **T2**, then p1 → p3 → p3 = 1, p4 = 0 → **T5 enabled**  
So we can fire **T5 before T3**, as long as we avoid firing **T3** (which is p2 → p4)

But **T3 is not fired yet** — so this is possible.

Let’s try again carefully.

### ✅ Correct Firing Sequence:

**Initial marking:**  
`p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`

**Step 1:** Fire **T1**  
- p0 → 0  
- p1 → 1  
- p2 → 1  
Marking: `p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`

**Step 2:** Fire **T2**  
- T2: p1 → p3
- p1 → 0
- p3 → 1  
Marking: `p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`

**Now:**
- T5 is enabled: p3 = 1 (normal arc), p4 = 0 (inhibitor arc) → ✅
- T3 is enabled: p2 = 1 → but we **do not** fire T3 yet.

**Step 3:** Fire **T5**  
- p3 → 0 (normal arc)
- p4 unchanged (inhibitor arc doesn’t consume)
- p6 → 1  
Marking: `p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1)`

✅ So **T5 fired**, and **T3 has not fired yet**.

Thus, **T5 fired before T3**.

### ✅ Conclusion:

**Yes**, it is possible for **T5 to fire before T3**.

### 🔍 Justification:
- T5 requires **p3 ≥ 1** and **p4 = 0**
- T2 can be fired (via T1) to place a token in p3
- T3 is *not* fired yet (we keep p2 with 1 token)
- Hence, T5 can fire as long as p4 is empty (which it is)
- So T5 can fire **before** T3, even though T3 is enabled (but not fired)

> ❗ Note: The fact that T3 is enabled does *not* prevent T5 from firing — they are independent **unless** T3 fires and places a token in p4 (which disables T5). We avoid that by **not firing T3**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Yes**, it is possible.

**Firing sequence:**  
**T1 → T2 → T5**

**Justification:** After T1 and T2, p3 = 1 and p4 = 0 → T5 is enabled and can fire. T3 is not yet fired, so it occurs after T5.
