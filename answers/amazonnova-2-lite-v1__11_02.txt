### Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review


To: COO, Acme Insurance


Three activities require immediate attention for improvement.
First, **Request Documents**, with **22% rework** and **5.5% SLA breaches**, is performing worst overall. This indicates repetitive tasks and systemic delays. Suggested improvement: redesign request templates to improve completion accuracy and efficiency.
Second, **Review Documents** has **12.4% SLA breaches** and **5.3% rework**. High variability (SD + 9 minutes) suggests inconsistent case handling and unclear requirements. Suggestion: Introduce standardized review guidelines and mandatory reviewer training to cut time and rework.
Third, **Initial Assessment** also stands out, with **3.2% SLA breaches** and **1.8% rework**. Long wait times (18 minutes on average, 12-minute processing) indicate resource constraints. Recommendation: re-allocate staff during peak hours to decrease bottleneck.

All other activities perform within normal and acceptable ranges.
