**Question 1:**  
No, in any reachable marking, **T5** cannot fire before **T3**.

**Question 2:**  
A minimal sequence demonstrating that **T5** cannot fire before **T3** is:  
**T1**, **T2**, **T4**, **T5**.  
Here, **T3** is never enabled without first enabling **T2** and **T4**, which both depend on **P4**, itself only reachable after **T2** has fired. Since **T2** must fire to produce tokens in **P3** and **P4**, and **T5** requires tokens in both **P2** and **P5**, **T3**'s occurrence is essential before **T5** can fire.
