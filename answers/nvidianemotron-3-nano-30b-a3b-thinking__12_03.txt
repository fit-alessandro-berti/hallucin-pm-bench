**Answer:** **No**

**Justification (citing the event‑log excerpt):**

| CaseID | Order of activities (chronological) | Does **Validate_Payment** follow **Receive_Order** immediately? |
|--------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C001** | Receive_Order (09:12) → Validate_Payment (09:15) → Pack_Items (10:00) | **Yes** – no activity occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment. |
| **C002** | Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05) | **No** – Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment. |
| **C003** | Receive_Order (09:40) → Validate_Payment (09:44) → Ship_Order (11:00) | **Yes** – no intervening activity. |
| **C004** | Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20) | **No** – Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment. |

Since at least two cases (C002 and C004) show other activities occurring between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, the statement “Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between” is **not** supported by the log data. Hence the FACT is inaccurate.
