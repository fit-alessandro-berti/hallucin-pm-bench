No, the fact is not accurate.

From the log:

- **Case 1001**: `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund`  
  Sequence: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → **Update_Inventory** → **Authorize_Refund** → Refund_Issued

- **Case 1002**: `Authorize_Refund` occurs, but **no** `Update_Inventory` activity appears in the case at all.  
  Sequence: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → **Authorize_Refund** → Refund_Issued

- **Case 1003**: `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund`, and they are **not adjacent** (Quality_Check is in between).  
  Sequence: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → **Update_Inventory** → Quality_Check → **Authorize_Refund**

In none of the cases does `Authorize_Refund` occur immediately before `Update_Inventory`.
