3. In this excerpt, “Manual_Fraud_Check” has low support (1 event, 1 case). Generalizing from this slice to the full log could mislead by underrepresenting its role, skewing performance metrics (e.g., average cycle time ignores its impact in rare fraud cases) or predictive models (e.g., underestimating fraud escalation paths, leading to inaccurate throughput predictions).
