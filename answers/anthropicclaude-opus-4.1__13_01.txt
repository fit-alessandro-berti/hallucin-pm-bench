Based on the 18 log lines provided, here are the answers:

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occur in this fragment?**
   1 time

2. **What percentage of all logged events does this represent?**
   1 out of 18 events = 5.56%

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check":**
   A1002

4. **Two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable:**
   - **Insufficient sample size**: With only 4 cases and just 1 occurrence of Manual_Fraud_Check, the sample is too small to reliably extrapolate to monthly frequencies. Random variation could significantly affect the estimate.
   
   - **Limited time window**: The fragment only covers approximately 5 hours on a single day (2025-05-01 from 09:00 to 14:05). This short duration cannot capture daily, weekly, or other temporal patterns that might affect the frequency of manual fraud checks throughout a full month.
