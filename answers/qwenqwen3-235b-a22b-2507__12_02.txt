No

The fact is inaccurate because in cases C003 and C005, *Validate_Payment* occurs before *Receive_Order*. Specifically, in line 6, case C003 performs *Validate_Payment* at 10:43:00Z, and only later in line 7 performs *Receive_Order* at 10:45:00Z. Similarly, in case C005 (lines 11â€“12), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 12:00:00Z, but there is no subsequent *Receive_Order* at all. Thus, *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order*.
