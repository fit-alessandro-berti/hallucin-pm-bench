1. **Request Documents:** Avg: 36.5h | 95th perc.: 120h  
   **Action:** Implement automated reminder emails triggered immediately upon request to policyholders, reducing follow-up delays by ≥20%.

2. **Send Closure Letter:** Avg: 12.2h | 95th perc.: 44h  
   **Action:** Automate closure-letter creation with templates triggered directly from claim-status update, achieving ≥20% waiting-time reduction.

3. **Assess Liability:** Avg: 7.8h | 95th perc.: 16.4h
