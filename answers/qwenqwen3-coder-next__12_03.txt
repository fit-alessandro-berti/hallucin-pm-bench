**No**

**Justification:**  
The FACT claims that *“Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between.”* This is contradicted by the following cases in the log:

- **C002**:  
  `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` (9:30 → 9:50) → `Validate_Payment` (10:05)  
  → *Validate_Payment occurs **after** Pack_Items*, not immediately after Receive_Order.

- **C004**:  
  `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` (10:05 → 10:07) → `Validate_Payment` (10:20)  
  → *Validate_Payment occurs **after** Check_Fraud*, not immediately after Receive_Order.

Only C001 and C003 show Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order, but the word *“always”* in the FACT requires it to hold for **all** cases. Since C002 and C004 violate this, the FACT is incorrect.
