1️⃣ The activity "Manual Fraud Check" occurs once in this data.

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the relative frequency of manual fraud checks in the complete dataset using just this excerpt because of two main data limitations: the short timeframe and low case sample. The snippet only shows a partial perspective with 3 cases in roughly an hour. Real-world scenarios would see a broader diversity of case patterns over a full month, including more activities tied to manual investigations across hundreds or thousands of cases. There might also be times/patterns that don’t yet show up here. Extrapolating broader insights from this tiny sample could lead to over-focusing on a less-common activity or under-representing others.
