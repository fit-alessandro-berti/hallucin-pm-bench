Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 is violated: the presence of `Expedite_Flag` (#4) requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur before the first `Ship_Goods`, but `Ship_Goods` occurs at #8 and `Risk_Assessment` only at #9.
2. Rule 3 is violated: `Three_way_match` takes place at #10, which is not within the next two activities after `Goods_Received` (#6), exceeding the allowed distance.
