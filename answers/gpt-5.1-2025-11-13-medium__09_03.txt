It is impossible to compute the average cycle time in hours for “Approve Invoice”, its standard deviation, or a 95 % confidence interval from the artefacts provided, because the actual event-log content (all rows and every timestamp value) has been fully removed. To calculate these metrics, I would need at least the start_time and/or complete_time for each event whose activity = "Approve Invoice" (and know whether cycle time is defined as duration of the activity itself or as throughput time between two activities). With only the column headers and no records—no timestamps, no case_ids, no event instances, and no sample size—no numerical calculation or statistical estimation is possible. The SLA catalogue and historical KPI (7.8 days from Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice) refer to a different time span and a different performance measure, and cannot be used to infer the cycle time distribution of the “Approve Invoice” activity in the redacted log.
