**No**

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1 (QE then RA, each once)**: **Violated**. While both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occur, they are **not in the correct order**. QA occurs before RA, which is correct, but `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occurs **after** `Notify_Authorities`, and more critically, **after** `Quality_Engineer_Review` by position — however, the order between QE and RA is actually preserved (QE before RA). So **this rule is satisfied**.

  ✅ Rule 1: Satisfied (QE before RA, both occur once).

- **Rule 2 (If severity = "High", VP after both QE and RA)**: **Satisfied**. Severity is "High", and `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`. ✅

- **Rule 3 (NA must occur after QE and RA)**: **Violated**. `Notify_Authorities` occurs **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, even though it occurs after `Quality_Engineer_Review`. Since **both QE and RA must be complete before NA**, this rule is **broken**. ❌

- **Rule 4 (CC only after NA and, if applicable, VP)**: **Satisfied**. `Close_Case` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` and after `VP_Safety_Approval`, so all required prior steps are met. ✅

**Final verdict: No — Rule 3 is violated.** `Notify_Authorities` must not occur until **after both** QE and RA are complete, but here it occurs before RA.
