Based on the 48-event excerpt provided:

**1. Frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check"**
The activity occurs **1** time (in case C05).

**2. Percentages**
**a) Percentage of all events:**
1 ÷ 48 = **2.08%**

**b) Percentage of all unique cases:**
1 ÷ 12 = **8.33%**

**3. Risks of Generalising (Analysis)**
With a sample size of one (N=1), this activity lacks statistical significance. Generalising from this single instance risks overfitting; analysts cannot reliably determine the standard duration or resource cost of manual checks based on C05 alone. Furthermore, predictive models may accurately capture the flow but fail to learn the specific attributes triggering the check due to extreme class imbalance. If C05 is treated as a standard representative, it introduces bias regarding the correlation between manual checks and the subsequent "Approve_Payout" outcome.
