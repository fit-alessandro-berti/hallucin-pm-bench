1. **No.**

2. The statement is violated in multiple cases:

- **Case C002**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  Here, **Pack_Items** occurs between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, so Validate_Payment is *not* immediately after Receive_Order.

- **Case C004**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  Here, **Check_Fraud** occurs between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, again breaking the “immediately after” condition.

Cases where the pattern holds:

- **C001**: `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`
- **C003**: `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order`

Because C002 and C004 contradict the claim, the fact **is not accurate** for this event-log excerpt.
