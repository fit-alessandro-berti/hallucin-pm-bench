Based solely on the provided 18 log lines:

1.  **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**
    *   **1** (occurs once in case A1002).

2.  **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**
    *   **5.56%** (1 occurrence / 18 total events = 0.05555... ≈ 5.56%).

3.  **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**
    *   **A1002**

4.  **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**
    *   **Extremely small sample size:** The fragment contains only 18 events over a single day. This is insufficient to represent the variability expected over a full month (approximately 30 days, implying thousands of events). A single occurrence in this tiny sample is highly volatile and unlikely to be representative of the true monthly rate.
    *   **Non-random sampling:** The fragment is a specific, arbitrary segment of the log (a single day's events). It is not a statistically random sample of events drawn from the entire population of events (e.g., all events over the month). Therefore, the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of "Manual_Fraud_Check" in this fragment may not reflect the true frequency distribution in the full monthly dataset. It could be unusually high, unusually low, or simply non-representative due to the specific time period chosen.
