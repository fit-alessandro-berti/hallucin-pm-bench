The user wants:

- Focus only on Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment.
- List each set of tasks that can execute concurrently (i.e., tasks that lie on different branches of the same parallel construct). So we need to identify parallel splits and merges. They gave the textual representation:

Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment (supplier-to-shelf)

1. Start
2. Receive_Stock
3. || Parallel Split #1 ||
   • Quality_Check
   • Update_Inventory
4. || Merge #1 ||
5. Store_Items
6. || Parallel Split #2 ||
   • Generate_Replenishment_Report
   • Notify_Procurement
7. || Merge #2 ||
8. End

Thus we have two parallel constructs:

- Parallel Split #1: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory can execute concurrently (two branches).
- Parallel Split #2: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement can execute concurrently.

The requirement: "list each set of tasks that can execute concurrently (i.e., tasks that lie on different branches of the same parallel construct). Number the sets in the order they appear in the process and give no information about Processes A or C."

Thus answer: 1. {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory}. 2. {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}.

But we need to consider if there are any other parallel constructs? The representation shows only two parallel splits. So we list accordingly.

Potential nuance: the question says "set of tasks that can execute concurrently" which could be a set containing tasks on same parallel construct (i.e., each set of tasks on each branch). Usually they'd be a set of tasks per parallel split. So we produce:

1. Quality_Check, Update_Inventory
2. Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement

We must also not include any info about other processes.

Thus answer: 

1. Quality_Check and Update_Inventory (Parallel Split #1)
2. Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement (Parallel Split #2)

We may optionally embed short description. But better to follow the request: "list each set ... Number the sets ..." So just numbers with the tasks.

Thus answer: 
1. {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory}
2. {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}

We must ensure we don't mention anything about Process A or C.

Now double-check the instruction: "Focusing only on Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment" and "list each set of tasks that can execute concurrently (i.e., tasks that lie on different branches of the *same* parallel construct)." So for each parallel construct, list the tasks on its branches.

Thus answer as above.

Make sure not to mention any extra info.

Thus produce answer.
