I cannot determine the average cycle time (in hours) of the "Review Contract" activity from the data provided.

Explanation: The event log header provided does not include timestamp or elapsed time information. While I can see that the "Review Contract" activity appears in cases C-001, C-002, C-003, and C-004, there is no duration data for any of these instances. The log header explicitly states that "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted," which means the necessary timing information to calculate cycle time is not available in this data.
