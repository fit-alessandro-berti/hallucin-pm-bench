Let's analyze the Petri net step by step to determine if T5 can fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

First, let's understand the net's structure:
- T1 is a parallel split from p0 to p1 and p2
- T2 removes tokens from p1 to p3
- T3 removes tokens from p2 to p4
- T4 synchronizes p3 and p4 (shifting their tokens to p5)
- T5 removes a token from p3 (normal arc) *and* inhibits a token from p4 (inhibitor arc)

For **T5 to fire before T3**, the T5 mark would need to be before the T3 mark.

Let's examine the possible T3 marks:
- T3 can only fire in the order p2→p4, so T3's mark can only be p4

Now, for **T5**:
- T5 has a normal arc to p6 and an inhibitor arc to p4
- The inhibitor arc requires p4 to be in a reset state (no tokens)
- But p2 → p4 cannot occur simultaneously with any arc from p4 (since transitions are modular, and inhibitor arcs block all incoming places while they're active)

Therefore, in any reachable marking, after p2→p4, neither p5 (which is formed by synchronizing p3 and p4), nor any subsequent place, can be simultaneously processed by a normal arc from p3 while p4 still has tokens.

 conclusion:
This means **T5 can never fire before T3**.

answer:
In any reachable marking of this net, it is **not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3**.

Proof:
- Transition T5 (to p6) can only fire after the transition to p3, since p4 is immediately after p3 in the transition sequence.
- When T5's mark is for p3, T4 has already fired (if it occurs), and T5's inhibitor arc from p4 is active, preventing any incoming tokens from p4 at that moment.
- Therefore, T5 can never fire before T3, as it is always delayed by the synchronization through T4.

The answer is: No, it is not possible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.
