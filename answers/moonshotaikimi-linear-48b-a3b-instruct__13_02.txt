3. With only one occurrence in 48 events, “Manual_Fraud_Check” is a rare outlier. Extrapolating from this tiny sample over-weights its impact, making metrics like average process time, directly-follows relationships, or fraud-check rates appear higher or more significant than they truly are. Predictive models may then misclassify similar cases as outliers or inflate expected manual-check frequency, leading to flawed strategies and misallocated resources.
