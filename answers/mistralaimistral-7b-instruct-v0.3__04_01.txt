 Compliant (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11)

Justification:
1. The PO amount exceeds €10 000, and it has received two approvals (from Procurement Officer and CFO) before the Issue_PO activity.
2. Although Expedite_Flag is present, the Quality_Check activity is not required in this trace, as it is not performed by any role. However, Risk_Assessment occurs before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods, which satisfies the rule.
3. Three_way_match is completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2) after Goods_Received.
4. No activity executed by the role Intern directly follows an activity executed by the role CFO.
5. The trace finishes with Archive_Record and contains nothing after it.
