No

**Justification:**

The trace is **not compliant** because it violates one of the rules in Ruleset R.

*   **Rule 1: Satisfied.** `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurs once and before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), which also occurs once.

*   **Rule 2: Satisfied.** The case severity is "High", and `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA are complete.

*   **Rule 3: Violated.** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs after QE but **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`. The rule requires NA to occur only *after both* QE and RA are complete.

*   **Rule 4: Satisfied.** `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
