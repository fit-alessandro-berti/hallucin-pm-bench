1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **twice** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002's events at 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z and 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).  

2️⃣ An analyst observing only this snippet might misestimate manual fraud check frequency due to low sample size and unrepresented variation. The snippet only includes 3 cases and 2 occurrences, which may not reflect general trends (e.g., fewer applications per month overall, skewed toward automatic fraud checks in cases where approvals occur quickly). Manual fraud checks only appear in one case, which could erroneously suggest they are rare or restricted to specific scenarios. Without full-month data, three factors aren’t considered: missing time-delayed checks, missed failures (e.g., declined applications), or disproportionate testing in specific cases. Thus, the estimate risks being overly optimistic or case-specific.
