1) The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” appears **1** time in this excerpt.

2) This snippet covers only three cases on a single day (all 2025‑03‑01), so it is a tiny, early, and potentially unrepresentative slice of a month‑long log. With just one occurrence of “Manual Fraud Check” here—and multiple automatic variants (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”)—an analyst might wrongly generalize that manual checks are rare or common without seeing later days, more cases, or differently labeled manual/automatic checks elsewhere. The limited scope and possible activity‑label variations can distort perceived frequency.
