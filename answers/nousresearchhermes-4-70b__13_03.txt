1️⃣ The **exact** activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1 time** in this excerpt. 

2️⃣ An analyst viewing only this snippet might overestimate the frequency of "Manual Fraud Check" in the full log. Here's why in 92 words:  
The snippet shows one manual check (CaseID 1002) versus two automatic checks within ~3 hours – suggesting a notable manual rate. However, without context of the full March data, the analyst cannot assess:  
• Whether this case was an anomaly (e.g., a flagged application).  
• If automatic checks dominate in other log portions (e.g., later in March, automatic checks may be far more prevalent).  
• Temporal trends (e.g., manual checks may spike only briefly in early March and drop off).  
Thus, generalizing frequency from this small, possibly unrepresentative sample risks misestimating the procedure's overall prevalence.
