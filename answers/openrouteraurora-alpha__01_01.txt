**Decision points in the Contoso Airlines refund process**

| # | Decision point (activity) | What is decided | When it occurs |
|---|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** | Whether the claim satisfies the eligibility rules (flight‑manifest match & weather conditions) | Immediately after the passenger submits the **RefundRequestForm** |
| 2 | **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** | Whether the claim passes the finance eligibility checklist | After the triage validation succeeds |
| 3 | **High‑value branch decision** (implicit in the flow) | Whether the refund amount is **> €1 000** → triggers the senior‑auditor path | After finance pre‑approval, based on the calculated refund amount |
| 4 | **Senior_Auditor_Review** (only for high‑value claims) | Whether the high‑value claim is approved after audit | When the amount exceeds €1 000 |
| 5 | **Process_Refund_Payment** | Whether to execute the bank‑transfer payment | Only after Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded **and**, for high‑value claims, Senior_Auditor_Review has been completed |
| 6 | **Issue_Confirmation_Letter** (system‑generated) | Whether to send the confirmation PDF to the passenger | After the payment has been successfully executed |
