**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1**: Compliant – The PO amount is €12,300 (above €10,000), and two approvals are present: first by *Procurement Officer* (event 2), then by *CFO* (event 3), both **before** `Issue_PO` (event 5). ✅  
2. **Rule 2**: **Violated** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event 4), which makes `Risk_Assessment` mandatory **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. However, `Risk_Assessment` occurs at event 9, **after** `Ship_Goods` at event 8. ❌  
3. **Rule 3**: Compliant – `Three_way_match` (event 10) occurs within two activities after `Goods_Received` (event 6): `Move_to_Quality` (7) and `Ship_Goods` (8). Distance = 2. ✅  
4. **Rule 4**: Compliant – No activity by *Intern* directly follows an activity by *CFO*. The *CFO* acts at event 3; the next event (4) is by *System*, not *Intern*. ✅  
5. **Rule 5**: Compliant – The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event 11), and no activity follows it. ✅  

**Conclusion**: The trace violates **Rule 2**, hence it is **Non-compliant**.
