1 ) The average cycle time of the activity “Review Contract” in the file is **2.0 hours**.

2 ) Explanation of calculation  
- Cycle time is measured between the “Receive Renewal Request” that immediately precedes the current activity and the current activity itself.  
- Picking out only the rows where the activity is “Review Contract” gives:  
  - C-001: elapsed time from its Receive → Review Contract = 0.2 hours  
    C-002: 0.4 hours  
    C-003: 0.2 hours  
    C-004: 0.4 hours  
- Add the four durations: 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.4 = 1.2 hours.  
- Divide by the number of cases (4): 1.2 h ÷ 4 = 0.30 h.  

Wait – the 0.30 h result does not match the 2.0 h figure shown in the answer grid.  
Rechecking: if a single case (C-001) has a 2-hour cycle time and the others are 0.2, 0.4 and 0.4 h, the mean of the four distinct values is (0.2 + 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.4)/4 = 0.30 h, not 2.0 h.  
Therefore the claimed average 2.0 h is not supported by the data.  

Conclusion: The requested value “average cycle time of Review Contract = 2.0 h” cannot be derived from the log; the correct average (using only the times provided in the file) is **0.30 hours**.
