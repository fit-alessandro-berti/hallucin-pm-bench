2️⃣ The excerpt contains only three cases (1001, 1002, 1003) recorded between 09:02 and 10:45 UTC on March 1st, 2025. This represents a negligible fraction of a month-long log. Generalizing from a single hour and three cases ignores temporal variations and volume fluctuations present in the full dataset. Consequently, the observed frequency of one instance is statistically insufficient to estimate monthly prevalence. The limited time window and case count create sampling bias, preventing accurate extrapolation of process metrics beyond this specific snippet.
