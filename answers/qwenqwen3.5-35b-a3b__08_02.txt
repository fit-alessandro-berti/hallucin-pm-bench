**Q1:** No.
**Q2:** No such sequence exists.
**Explanation:** T3 and T5 are mutually exclusive due to the conflict on place P2. P2 receives exactly one token from T1 with no other inputs. Both T3 and T5 consume a token from P2 to fire. Firing T5 removes the sole token in P2, permanently disabling T3. Therefore, T3 cannot fire after T5. In any valid sequence containing both transitions, T3 must fire first (if T5 is not chosen at all). Consequently, there is no reachable firing sequence where T5 precedes T3.
