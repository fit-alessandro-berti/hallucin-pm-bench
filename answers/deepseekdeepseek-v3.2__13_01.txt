1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1** time in the fragment.

2. This represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1 out of 18 events).

3. The case identifier containing "Manual_Fraud_Check" is **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why estimating the monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable:
   - **Limited time frame**: The data covers only one day (May 1, 2025), which may not reflect daily or weekly variations in fraud-check frequency over a full month.
   - **Small sample size**: With only four cases, the fragment is too small to provide a statistically reliable estimate for monthly activity rates.
