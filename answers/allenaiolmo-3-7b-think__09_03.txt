The event-log data (Artefact A) contains no actual rows of data—only the header row is provided, with all case-specific values, including timestamps for "Approve Invoice," redacted. Cycle time calculations require start_time and complete_time values for each activity instance, which are unavailable. Thus, the average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval cannot be computed from the given artefacts.
