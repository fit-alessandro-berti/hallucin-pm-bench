I am unable to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity “Approve Invoice” based on the provided artefacts.

The event log stub (Artefact A) explicitly states that "Every row and every timestamp value has been removed for privacy," meaning no actual event data, including start and complete times for any activity, is available. To calculate the cycle time for "Approve Invoice," one would need the individual `start_time` and `complete_time` for each instance of this activity, which are missing. Artefact B provides aggregate historical data, specifically an average duration *between* "Approve Invoice" and "Pay Invoice" (7.8 days), but this is not the cycle time *of* the "Approve Invoice" activity itself (i.e., its duration from start to completion).
