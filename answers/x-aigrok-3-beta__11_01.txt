Our analysis of waiting times across key activities over the past 12 months identifies the three worst-performing activities:  
1. **Request_Documents**: Avg. Waiting Time: 36.5h; 95th Percentile: 120.0h  
   - **Action**: Implement an automated document request system with reminders to reduce delays by ≥20%.  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg. Waiting Time: 12.2h; 95th Percentile: 44.0h  
   - **Action**: Standardize templates and automate letter generation to cut waiting time by ≥20%.  
3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg. Waiting Time: 7.8h; 95th Percentile: 16.4h  
   - **Action**: Assign dedicated staff for peak caseloads to expedite processing by ≥20%.  

These targeted, data-driven actions will improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. I’m available to discuss implementation details.
