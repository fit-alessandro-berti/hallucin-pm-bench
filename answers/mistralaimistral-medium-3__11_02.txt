**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance**

**Key Issues & Recommendations:**

1. **Request_Documents**
   - *Why underperforming*: Extreme wait time (150 min) and high rework rate (22%) indicate inefficiency in document collection or customer responsiveness.
   - *Action*: Implement automated document reminders and pre-validation checks to reduce rework.

2. **Review_Documents**
   - *Why underperforming*: Long processing time (25 min) with high variability (9 min) and SLA breaches (12.4%) suggest inconsistent review standards or bottlenecks.
   - *Action*: Standardize review guidelines and introduce parallel processing for complex cases.

3. **Initial_Assessment**
   - *Why underperforming*: Moderate wait time (18 min) and high SLA breaches (3.2%) point to capacity constraints or unclear assessment criteria.
   - *Action*: Add a triage step to prioritize high-risk claims and reduce queueing delays.

**Note**: While *Approve_Claim* and *Calculate_Payout* show minor inefficiencies, their metrics are not severe enough to warrant immediate action.

**Summary**: Focus on reducing rework in *Request_Documents*, improving consistency in *Review_Documents*, and streamlining *Initial_Assessment* to enhance throughput.
