Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2 violated:** `Expedite_Flag` occurs (#4), so `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` is at **#8** and `Risk_Assessment` at **#9** (too late).
2. **Rule 3 violated:** After `Goods_Received` (#6), `Three_way_match` must be completed **within the next two activities** (distance ≤ 2). Here, `Three_way_match` occurs at **#10**, with **three** intervening activities (#7–#9), so the distance is **4**, not ≤ 2.
