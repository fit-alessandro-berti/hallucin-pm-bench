**Answer**

**Question 1:** No, **T5** cannot fire before **T3**.

**Question 2:** **T5** requires both *P2* and *P5* to fire, while **T3** produces *P4*, which leads to *P5*. The firing sequence for **T5** must include **T3**. Therefore, **T3** must fire before **T5** to provide the required *P5* token.

Minimal firing sequence to reach **T5**:
[**T1, T2, T7, T4, T3**] (provides *P2* and *P5*)  ðŸ‘‰
[**T5**] fires
