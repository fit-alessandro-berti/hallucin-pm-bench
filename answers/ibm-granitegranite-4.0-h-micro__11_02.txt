**Subject:** Performance Analytics – Claims Handling (Q1-2025)

The Claims Handling process shows notable inefficiencies in four activities. The three worst performers are **Review_Documents**, **Approve_Claim**, and **Calculate_Payout**.

1. **Review_Documents (avg_throughput 185, sla_breach_pct 12.4%)** – High wait time (30 min) and substantial processing variability (stdev 9 min) cause frequent SLA breaches.  
   *Action:* Implement automated document validation tools to reduce manual review time and standardize document formats.

2. **Approve_Claim (avg_throughput 182, sla_breach_pct 0.9%)** – Despite a low breach rate, the long processing time (6 min) and moderate variability (stdev 2 min) hinder throughput.  
   *Action:* Introduce a fast-track approval workflow for low-risk claims to boost throughput without compromising accuracy.

3. **Calculate_Payout (avg_throughput 181, rework_rate_pct 0.8%)** – Moderate processing time (9 min) and a non-negligible rework rate indicate inefficiencies in calculation accuracy.  
   *Action:* Deploy a predictive modeling system to enhance payout calculations, thereby lowering rework frequency and speeding up processing.

These targeted actions, grounded in the provided metrics, aim to improve overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
