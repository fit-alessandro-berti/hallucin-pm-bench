1️⃣ The activity "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1 time** in this excerpt.  
2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might overestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because the small sample contains only one instance, while other activities (like "Create Application") appear more often. Without data on the total number of cases or all activity types for the full month, they may assume manual checks are rare or infrequent based on this limited sample.
