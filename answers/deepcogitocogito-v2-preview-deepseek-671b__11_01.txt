Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a process-mining analyst, and I need to draft a memo for the COO of Orion Insurance about the three worst-performing activities by waiting time. The memo must be concise, within 150 words, and follow the given instructions precisely.

First, I need to identify the three activities with the highest average waiting times. Let's list them out from the provided data:

1. **Request_Documents**: 36.5 hours (avg), 120.0 hours (95th %)
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: 12.2 hours (avg), 44.0 hours (95th %)
3. **Assess_Liability**: 7.8 hours (avg), 16.4 hours (95th %)
4. Approve_Payment: 3.2 hours
5. Initial_Screening: 2.1 hours
6. Fraud_Check: 0.9 hours
7. Reject_Claim: 0.6 hours
8. Submit_Claim: 0.4 hours

So the top three are Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, and Assess_Liability.

Next, I need to rank them from worst to third: #1 is Request_Documents, #2 is Send_Closure_Letter, and #3 is Assess_Liability.

Now, for each, I must quote both average and 95th percentile waiting times.

Then, recommend one data-driven action per activity to reduce waiting time by at least 20%. Let me think about possible actions:

1. **Request_Documents (36.5h avg)**: This has a very high waiting time, possibly due to delays in customer response. Action: Implement automated reminders and a self-service portal for document upload to reduce follow-up delays.
2. **Send_Closure_Letter (12.2h avg)**: This might be batch processing. Action: Switch to real-time automated dispatch triggered by claim closure.
3. **Assess_Liability (7.8h avg)**: Could be due to manual assessment. Action: Deploy AI-based liability assessment tools to speed up the process.

I need to ensure that each recommendation is concrete, data-driven, and likely to achieve at least a 20% reduction. Also, avoid mentioning service time, throughput, or non-listed activities.

Now, draft the memo concisely, hitting all the key points without exceeding 150 words.
