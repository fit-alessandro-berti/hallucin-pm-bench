| # | Decision point | Rule (one‑sentence description) |
|---|----------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | **Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check** | The loan is assigned a risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) based on the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow). |
| 2 | **Risk‑and‑Amount Branch** | If the risk rating is **Low or Medium** **and** the requested amount is **≤ €250 000**, the process skips the Manual‑Underwriting‑Review; otherwise it proceeds to that review. |
