No

**Justification:**
The fact is inaccurate because there are instances in the log where activities occur between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**.

*   **Case C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` (09:30:00) → `Pack_Items` (09:50:00) → `Validate_Payment` (10:05:00). Here, **Pack_Items** intervenes.
*   **Case C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` (10:05:00) → `Check_Fraud` (10:07:00) → `Validate_Payment` (10:20:00). Here, **Check_Fraud** intervenes.

Therefore, **Validate_Payment** does not *always* occur immediately after **Receive_Order**.
