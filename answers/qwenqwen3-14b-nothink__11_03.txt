**Executive Memo for COO**

The three worst-performing activities, based on both SLA breaches and high waiting times, are **Legal Approval**, **Risk Review**, and **Credit Assessment**. 

- **Legal Approval** exceeds its SLA by **300 seconds** (900 vs. 600) and has a waiting time of **600 seconds**. 
- **Risk Review** exceeds its SLA by **300 seconds** (600 vs. 300) and has a waiting time of **480 seconds**. 
- **Credit Assessment** exceeds its SLA by **60 seconds** (300 vs. 240) and has a waiting time of **200 seconds**.

**Recommendations:**  
- For **Legal Approval**, introduce a dedicated team to streamline review processes and reduce processing time.  
- For **Risk Review**, implement automated risk assessment tools to cut down on manual processing delays.  
- For **Credit Assessment**, retrain staff on efficient evaluation techniques and provide additional resources to manage workload.
