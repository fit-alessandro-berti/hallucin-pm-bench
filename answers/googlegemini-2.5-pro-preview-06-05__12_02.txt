No.

The stated fact is not accurate because there are multiple counter-examples in the log. In case C003, the activity `Validate_Payment` on line 6 occurs at 10:43:00Z, which is *before* `Receive_Order` on line 7 at 10:45:00Z. Additionally, in case C005, a `Validate_Payment` event is recorded on line 11, but a `Receive_Order` activity is never recorded for that case at all, meaning payment could not have followed an order.
