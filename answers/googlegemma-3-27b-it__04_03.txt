**No**

**Justification:**

* **Rule 1 (QE and RA order):** Violated. `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), but `Notify_Authorities` intervenes before RA is completed. The rule requires QE and RA to occur *sequentially* without interruption.
* **Rule 2 (VP after QE & RA for High severity):** Not applicable as QE and RA are not completed before VP.
* **Rule 3 (NA after QE & RA):** Violated. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA).
* **Rule 4 (CC after NA and VP):** Not applicable as earlier rules are violated.
