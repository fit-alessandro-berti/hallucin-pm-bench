Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants two things: a summary of every decision point in Acme Bank’s loan approval process and a list of all required documents in order. 

Starting with part a), decision points. From the process description, I need to identify where decisions are made. The first decision point is the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome which determines the risk rating. Then there's a conditional branch if the risk is Low/Medium and the amount is ≤€250,000, which skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review. Next is the TriVote decision gate, which requires approvals from three roles, but only two are needed to pass. That's three decision points.

For part b), documents. The process mentions several documents: Form 14B at the start, Deck Memo for Manual Review, Offer Sheet 77, Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, and Loan Dossier 2025. KYC/AML checks are outsourced, so those documents aren't part of the in-house process. I need to list them in the order they first appear.

Let me double-check the process steps to ensure I didn't miss any decision points or documents. The Tri-Color-Risk-Check leads to the first conditional branch. Then the TriVote is another decision gate. The documents are listed in order as they appear in the steps. The note about KYC/AML being outsourced confirms those aren't included. Sustainability Officer's mandatory participation is noted but doesn't add a decision point beyond TriVote. 

I think that's all. Now, structure the answers clearly for each part.
**a) Decision Points Summary:**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check Decision Point**
Assigns risk rating (Low/Medium/High) based on inputs from Scorecard-Cyan, Scorecard-Magenta, and Scorecard-Yellow.

2. **Conditional Branch Decision Point**
Determines whether to skip Manual-Underwriting-Review based on risk rating being Low/Medium AND requested amount ≤ €250,000.

3. **TriVote Decision Gate**
Requires approvals from Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer, with any two approvals sufficient for passing.

**b) Required Documents (First-Appearance Order):**

1. Form 14B (Step 1: Receive-Application)
2. Scorecard-Cyan, Scorecard-Magenta, Scorecard-Yellow (Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
3. Deck Memo (Step 5: Manual-Underwriting-Review)
4. Offer Sheet 77 (Step 7: Prepare-Binding-Offer)
5. Signed Offer Sheet 77 (Step 8: Request-Applicant-Confirmation)
6. ID Matrix Declaration (Step 8: Request-Applicant-Confirmation)
7. Loan Dossier 2025 (Step 9: Finalize-Agreement)

*Note: KYC/AML documents are outsourced to a third-party vendor and therefore not included in this list.*
