Answer: **No**

Justification based on ruleset R:
1. **Rule 1 violation**: RA occurs after NA (which should not happen until after both QE and RA complete), meaning QE and RA were not completed in the required order.
2. **Rule 2 fulfilled**: VP_Safety_Approval (VP) occurs after QE and RA (though RA is out of order).
   *(Note: QE and RA were not in order, but VP did happen after both.)*
3. **Rule 3 violation**: NA occurs before RA, violating the requirement that NA must happen after both QE and RA.
4. **Rule 4 fulfilled**: CC occurs after NA and VP (as required by Rule 2 due to high severity).

**Key violations**: Rule 1 (wrong order) and Rule 3 (NA prematurely executed).
Thus, the trace is **non-compliant**.
