1. Manual_Fraud_Check occurs exactly 1 time.

2. There are 18 events in total. Thus, 1/18 × 100 ≈ 5.56% of the events are Manual_Fraud_Check.

3. Only case A1002 contains Manual_Fraud_Check.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable are:
 • The fragment covers only a very short time period (all events are from May 1), so it may not represent the typical monthly process behavior.
 • The sample size is extremely small (just 18 events, with only 1 manual fraud check), which means the observed frequency could be heavily influenced by random variation and is not statistically robust for a monthly estimate.
