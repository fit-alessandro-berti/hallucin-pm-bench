After examining our process data, I have identified the three activities requiring immediate attention due to severe SLA breaches combined with high waiting times:

1. **Risk Review**:  
   - Current average throughput time: 600s (SLA: 300s); SLA exceeded by 300s.  
   - Significant waiting time of 480s indicates substantial delays.  
   - **Recommendation**: Assign additional qualified resources during peak processing periods to reduce waiting and processing times.

2. **Credit Assessment**:  
   - Current average throughput time: 300s (SLA: 240s); SLA exceeded by 60s.  
   - Elevated waiting time (200s) contributes significantly to lag.  
   - **Recommendation**: Streamline workflow by reallocating staff to promptly initiate assessments immediately after identity verification.

3. **Verify Identity**:  
   - Current average throughput time: 120s (SLA: 90s); SLA exceeded by 30s.  
   - High waiting time (80s) highlights inefficient queuing.  
   - **Recommendation**: Automate identity checks or introduce preliminary screening tools to lower waiting periods.

Implementing these targeted actions will directly address our most critical performance bottlenecks and improve overall SLA adherence.
