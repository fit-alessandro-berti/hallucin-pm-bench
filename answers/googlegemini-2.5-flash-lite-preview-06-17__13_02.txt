Here are the answers based on the provided log excerpt:

1.  The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time.

2.  **a)** 1 out of 48 events = **2.08%**
    **b)** 1 out of 12 unique cases = **8.33%**

3.  A low-support activity like **“Manual_Fraud_Check”**, appearing only once in this small sample, can mislead analyses. Generalizing from such a rare occurrence might overestimate its frequency or impact on process duration and outcomes. It could disproportionately skew performance metrics (like average case duration) or make predictive models unreliable, as the single instance might not be representative of typical behavior.
