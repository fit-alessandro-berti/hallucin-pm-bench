**Answer 1:** Yes.  
**Answer 2:** [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5].  

After firing T1 (initial step), P1 and P2 have tokens. Firing T2 (consuming P1竊単3), then T7 (P3竊単4), T4 (P4竊単5) enables P5. P2 remains, so T5 fires (P2+P5竊単6) **before** T3 is ever triggered. T3 requires P2, which is consumed by T5 here. No shorter sequence exists.
