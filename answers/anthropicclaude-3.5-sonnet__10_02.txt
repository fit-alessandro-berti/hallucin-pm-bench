I'll create a RACI matrix using the mandated vocabulary, translating the roles appropriately and breaking down the activities clearly.

| Activity | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|----------|:------------------:|:------------------:|:----------:|
| Log transfer instruction in system | R | I | - |
| Screen payment against sanctions list | R | C | - |
| Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary | C | R | - |
| Approve high-risk transactions | C | R | - |
| Release payment to SWIFT network | R | I | A |
| Archive case documentation | I | I | R |

Legend:
- R = Responsible (performs the work)
- A = Accountable (ultimately answerable)
- C = Consulted (provides input)
- I = Informed (kept updated)
- (-) = No involvement

Notes:
- Used "Transaction Analyst" instead of "payment clerk"
- Used "Regulatory Liaison" instead of "compliance officer"
- Used "KYC Review" instead of "customer due diligence"
- Maintained IT Support as original since it wasn't part of the vocabulary mandate
- Split activities into clear, discrete steps
- Included all key stakeholders for each activity
