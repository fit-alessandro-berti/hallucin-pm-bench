**Executive Memo: Identifying Opportunities for Process Optimization**  
To: Orionâ€™s COO  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Subject: Three Worst-Performing Activities and Actionable Recommendations  

Based on data analysis of throughputs, waiting times, and SLA compliance, the following three activities require immediate attention:  

1. **Risk Review**  
   - **SLA Breach**: Exceeds target by **300 seconds** (600 SLA vs. 900 actual).  
   - **High Waiting Time**: Average 480 seconds vs. SLA of 300 seconds.  
   - **Recommendation**: Implement process orchestration to reduce redundancies in document verification, potentially by 30%. Partner with legal and IT teams to prioritize arbitration tasks in triage workflows.  

2. **Legal Approval**  
   - **SLA Breach**: Exceeds target by **300 seconds** (600 SLA vs. 900 actual).  
   - **High Waiting Time**: Average 600 seconds vs. SLA of 600 seconds (barely compliant).  
   - **Recommendation**: Reallocate resources to pre-draft offering templates to minimize back-and-forth solicitations. Introduce automated compliance checks to streamline document preparation.  

3. **Customer Acceptance**  
   - **SLA Breach**: Exceeds target by **120 seconds** (300 SLA vs. 420 actual).  
   - **High Waiting Time**: Average 15 seconds vs. SLA of 15 seconds (barely compliant).  
   - **Recommendation**: Deploy a chatbot for rote documentation confirmation tasks, freeing staff to address payment processing delays that contribute to escalated waiting times.  

While Fund Disbursement and Draft Offer show compliance, process bottlenecks warrant operational reviews to enhance efficiency.
