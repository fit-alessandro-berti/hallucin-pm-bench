 No, the fact is inaccurate.

* **Case 1001** shows the opposite order: *Update_Inventory* (08:25:55) occurs **before** *Authorize_Refund* (08:30:02), not after.  
* **Case 1003** shows *Update_Inventory* (10:08:07) followed by *Quality_Check* and then *Authorize_Refund* (10:22:18), so *Authorize_Refund* is neither immediately before nor after *Update_Inventory*.  
* **Case 1002** contains *Authorize_Refund* but contains no *Update_Inventory* at all.
