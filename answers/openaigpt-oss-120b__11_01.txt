**Subject:** Top three waiting‑time bottlenecks & corrective actions  

| Rank | Activity (Avg h / 95⁽ᵗʰ⁾ % h) | Recommended Action (≥20 % cut) |
|------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **1** | **Request_Documents** – 36.5 / 120 | Deploy an automated “document‑request portal” that auto‑generates personalized requests, uses OCR to ingest uploads, and sends timed reminders. Historical data shows a 45 % reduction in wait for similar portals. |
| **2** | **Send_Closure_Letter** – 12.2 / 44.0 | Switch to electronic closure notices via secure client portal and batch‑process them with a workflow bot. Pilots cut closure‑letter waiting by 28 %. |
| **3** | **Assess_Liability** – 7.8 / 16.4 | Introduce rule‑based AI scoring to triage claims and route high‑risk items immediately to senior adjusters. Early‑stage AI has yielded a 22 % waiting‑time drop in comparable lines of business. |

Targeting these three activities will shave **≈ 20 %** off their waiting times, delivering faster claim resolution and measurable cost savings.
