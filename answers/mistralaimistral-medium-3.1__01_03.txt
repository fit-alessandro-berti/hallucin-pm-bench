### **a) Decision Points in Acme Bank’s Small-Business Loan-Approval Process**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3)**
   - The combined output of the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) assigns a risk rating of **Low, Medium, or High**.

2. **Conditional Skip of Manual Underwriting (Step 4)**
   - *If* the risk is **Low or Medium** **and** the requested amount is **≤ €250,000**, the process **skips** the Manual Underwriting Review (Step 5).

3. **TriVote Decision Gate (Step 6)**
   - The loan requires **at least two approvals out of three** (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) to proceed.

4. **Applicant Confirmation (Step 8)**
   - The process halts until the applicant returns the **signed Offer Sheet 77** and **ID Matrix Declaration**; without these, the loan cannot be finalized.
