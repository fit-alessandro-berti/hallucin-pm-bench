I cannot determine the average cycle time of the "Review Contract" activity from the provided data. 

Explanation: The event log header shows case IDs, activities, and resources, but does not contain any timestamp or duration information for the "Review Contract" activity. The elapsed-time fields have been redacted as stated in the header description. Without timestamp data or explicitly provided durations for this activity, I cannot calculate the average cycle time.

The historical benchmark data does provide average durations for some activities ("Receive Renewal Request," "Negotiate Terms," and "Legal Sign-off"), but notably does not include information about the "Review Contract" activity, and is from a different customer segment anyway.
