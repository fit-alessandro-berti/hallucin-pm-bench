As a process-mining analyst, I have compared the two versions of the Acme Bank *Loan_Process*. Here is the summary of the changes:

**Added tasks**
*   **Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`): Inserted as the initial step following the Start Event.
*   **Request Additional Documents** (`Task_RequestDocs`): Added as a new path originating from the decision gateway.
*   **Final Reject** (`Task_FinalReject`): Added as a task (replacing the previous reject task functionality).

**Removed tasks**
*   **Reject Loan** (`Task_RejectLoan`): This specific task ID and element were removed from the process flow in favor of the new rejection task structure.

**Gateway-type changes (e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)**
*   **Gateway_Decision**: Changed from an **Exclusive Gateway** (`<exclusiveGateway>`) to an **Inclusive Gateway** (`<inclusiveGateway>`). This enables the potential for multiple concurrent outcomes (e.g., approving while also requesting documents) rather than a single mutually exclusive path.
