I cannot compute the requested metrics because the event log contains no rows or timestamps. While the header shows that the necessary fields (activity, lifecycle, start_time, complete_time) would normally allow calculating the cycle time for “Approve Invoice” (e.g., using start-to-complete durations per event or per activity instance), all actual values have been removed. Without any timestamps or event instances for “Approve Invoice,” it is impossible to derive the average cycle time in hours, its standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval. The SLA catalogue excerpt provides only a cross-activity KPI (Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice) and cannot be used to infer the duration of the “Approve Invoice” activity itself.
