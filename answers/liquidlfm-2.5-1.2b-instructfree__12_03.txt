The log demonstrates that after “Receive_Order” (Case C001), a “Validate_Payment” occurs at 09:15:00, which is **not immediately after** the “Receive_Order” timestamp (which is 09:12:00). The activity sequence shows delays and multiple transfers between different systems, contradicting the FACT that validation is strictly adjacent to the receipt action.
