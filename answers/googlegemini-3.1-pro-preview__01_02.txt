### **Decision Points in the Process**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** 
   * **Condition:** Evaluates the independent risk scores (0–9) assigned during the Dual Underwriter Split by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B.
   * **Outcome:** If the scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues to the Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC). If they differ by more than 2 points, the application is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision before continuing.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**
   * **Condition:** Evaluates the requested loan amount.
   * **Outcome:** If the amount is **< €15 000**, the system auto-approves the loan. If the amount is **≥ €15 000**, the application proceeds to the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** *(Only for amounts ≥ €15 000)*
   * **Condition:** The Micro-loan Board reviews the application. 
   * **Outcome:** The board votes to either **approve** or **reject** the micro-loan before funds can be disbursed.
