## Rule-by-Rule Analysis

**R1 — Manager_Approval → Finance_Approval for orders > €10 000**
**Compliant.** €12 450 triggers the rule; Manager_Approval (03-03) correctly precedes Finance_Approval (03-04).

---

**R2 — Ship_Goods within 2 calendar days of last required approval (expedited)**
**Compliant.** Last required approval (Finance_Approval) was 03-04 08:17; Ship_Goods was 03-05 10:26 — ~1 day later, within the 2-day window.

---

**R3 — Pay_Invoice must not occur before Receive_Goods**
**Violated.** Pay_Invoice (03-06 09:00) occurred **one full day before** Receive_Goods (03-07 14:13).

---

**R4 — Safety_Inspection required between Receive_Goods and Store_Goods (hazardous)**
**Not Applicable.** `hazardous = false`; rule is not triggered.

---

**R5 — Change_Request after approval requires new Manager_Approval before any further processing**
**Violated.** Change_Request (event 4, 03-04 15:42) occurred after both approvals. Ship_Goods, Pay_Invoice, and Receive_Goods all proceeded **before** the re-approval (event 8, 03-07 15:10).

---

**R6 — Case must terminate with Archive_Record**
**Compliant.** The final event in the trace is Archive_Record (03-07 16:20).

---

## Overall Result

> **NON-COMPLIANT**

Two rules are violated:
- **R3** — Payment was made before goods were received (financial control breach).
- **R5** — Multiple processing steps executed after a Change_Request without the required re-approval (authorization control breach).
