**Question 1:** No.

**Question 2:** T5 cannot fire before T3 because T5 requires a token in P2 (from T1) *and* a token in P5 (from T4). T4 needs a token in P4, which can only come from T3 or T7. However, T7 depends on T2, which requires P1 (from T1). Since T1 produces P1 and P2 simultaneously, T3 (using P2) or T2→T7 (using P1) must fire before T4→T5. Thus, T3 or T7 must precede T5, making T5 firing before T3 impossible.

*Minimal sequence where T5 fires after T3:* `[T1, T3, T4, T5]`.
