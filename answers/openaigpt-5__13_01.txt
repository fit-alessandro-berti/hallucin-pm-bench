4. - Extremely small, time-limited sample: only 4 cases and 18 events from a narrow window on 2025-05-01 (≈09:00–14:05), not representative of an entire month.
   - Non-random/unknown sampling method: this fragment is a convenience slice; without random sampling across the month, selection bias can distort the estimated frequency.
