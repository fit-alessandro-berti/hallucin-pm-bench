We need to examine the compliance rules R1–R6, analyze the event trace for case #47291, and for each rule output Compliant, Violated, or Not Applicable, with a justification ≤20 words. Then conclude with overall result: COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT.

First, understand the event trace: It's a chronological list of events. Let's parse each event:

1. Create_PO: amount €12,450, expedited = true, hazardous = false, date: 2025-03-03 09:12.

2. Manager_Approval: approver Lee, date: 2025-03-03 11:05.

3. Finance_Approval: approver Martinez, date: 2025-03-04 08:17.

4. Change_Request: field delivery_address, date: 2025-03-04 15:42.

5. Ship_Goods: carrier DHL, date: 2025-03-05 10:26.

6. Receive_Goods: warehouse WH-5, date: 2025-03-07 14:13.

7. Pay_Invoice: method SEPA, date: 2025-03-06 09:00.

8. Manager_Approval: approver Lee, date: 2025-03-07 15:10.

9. Store_Goods: location Rack-21, date: 2025-03-07 16:02.

10. Archive_Record: date: 2025-03-07 16:20.

We need to check each rule.

R1: Any purchase order with total_amount > €10,000 must have Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval. In this case, total_amount is €12,450 > 10k, so we need Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval. The trace shows Manager_Approval (Lee) at step 2, then Finance_Approval (Martinez) at step 3. So that seems to satisfy R1. However, we need to check if there is any missing approval or if the order is reversed. Also, the Change_Request occurs after Fiscal Approval, which might trigger R5. But for R1, we need to see if Manager_Approval is followed by Finance_Approval before any further processing? The trace: after Manager_Approval, Finance_Approval occurs next. So R1 is satisfied. Also note that after Finance_Approval, we have a Change_Request (step 4). That might lead to needing a new Manager_Approval before further processing (step 8). That's consistent with R5. So R1 is Compliant.

R2: If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval. The last required approval for R1 is Finance_Approval (since R1 requires Manager followed by Finance). The last required approval event is Finance_Approval at step 3 (2025-03-04 08:17). Then Ship_Goods is at step 5 (2025-03-05 10:26). That's exactly 1 day apart (or 1 day difference). Let's count days: from 2025-03-04 to 2025-03-05 is 1 day (or 1 day later). The requirement is "within 2 calendar days after the last required approval". That means the time between last approval and Ship_Goods must be <= 2 days. Indeed, it's 1 day, so compliant. However, we need to check if the "last required approval" is Manager_Approval or Finance_Approval. R1 says Manager followed by Finance. So the last required approval is Finance. So we check distance from Finance_Approval to Ship_Goods. It's 1 day. So R2 is Compliant.

But check the definition: "within 2 calendar days after the last required approval". Does that include the same day? Typically, "within 2 days" means up to 2 days inclusive. So 1 day is within 2 days. So R2 is Compliant.

R3: Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods. The Pay_Invoice event is step 7 (2025-03-06 09:00). Receive_Goods is step 6 (2025-03-07 14:13). Wait, Pay_Invoice is before Receive_Goods (March 6 vs March 7). That's a violation: Pay_Invoice occurs before Receive_Goods. So R3 is Violated.

R4: If hazardous = true, a Safety_Inspection must occur after Receive_Goods and before Store_Goods. In this case, hazardous = false, so rule not applicable? R4 says "If hazardous = true". Since hazardous = false, the rule does not apply (Not Applicable). So R4 is Not Applicable.

R5: If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step. The Change_Request occurs at step 4 after Finance_Approval (step 3). The trace then continues: after Change_Request, there is no Manager_Approval until step 8, which is after Store_Goods and after Pay_Invoice. That indicates that after Change_Request, they continued processing (Ship_Goods, Receive_Goods, Pay_Invoice, Store_Goods) without obtaining a new Manager_Approval. According to R5, they must get a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step. So they violated R5. However, we need to check if the "further processing step" includes Ship_Goods, Receive_Goods, etc. The trace shows Ship_Goods (step 5) is after Change_Request but before the new Manager_Approval (step 8). So indeed, R5 is Violated.

R6: Every case must terminate with Archive_Record. The case ends with Archive_Record (step 10). So R6 is Compliant.

Thus we have:

R1: Compliant (Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval as required)
R2: Compliant (Ship_Goods within 2 days after Finance_Approval)
R3: Violated (Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods)
R4: Not Applicable (hazardous = false)
R5: Violated (Change_Request occurred, but new Manager_Approval not obtained before further processing)
R6: Compliant (Archive_Record at end)

Overall result: The case is NON-COMPLIANT because of R3 and R5 violations.

But we need to ensure we haven't missed nuance: R5 says "If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step." The Change_Request occurs after Finance_Approval (so after an approval). The purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step. The trace shows after Change_Request, they went directly to Ship_Goods (step 5). Did they get a new Manager_Approval before Ship_Goods? No, they didn't. So R5 is Violated.

However, we must also consider if the new Manager_Approval could be the same as the prior Manager_Approval? The rule says "must obtain a new Manager_Approval". It could be the same approver but a new approval event. So we need a new Manager_Approval event, not just the same person sending it again. In the trace, step 8 is a Manager_Approval, but it's after the changed events. So that's fine: they did get a new Manager_Approval (though too late). So R5 is Violated.

Thus overall NON-COMPLIANT.

Now we need to produce answer in the required format: For each rule, say Compliant, Violated, or Not Applicable, followed by ≤ 20-word justification. Then conclude with overall result: COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT.

The answer must be structured as:

R1: Compliant / Violated / Not Applicable - justification ≤20 words

R2: ...

...

R6: ...

Overall result: COMPLIANT / NON-COMPLIANT

We must ensure we follow the exact format. The user says: "For each rule say Compliant, Violated, or Not Applicable, followed by ≤ 20-word justification." Then "Conclude with overall result: COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT (all-caps)."

We must not add any extra text beyond that? The user says "Follow the required answer format." So likely they want a list of rule results with justifications, then the final line.

We need to ensure we keep each justification ≤20 words. Let's count.

R1: Any purchase order with total_amount > €10,000 must have Manager followed by Finance approval. In this case, Manager_Approval then Finance_Approval. So Compliant.

Justification: "R1: Compliant - Manager_Approval then Finance_Approval satisfied total amount > €10,000."

We need ≤20 words. Let's count: R1 (2), Compliant (1), Manager_Approval (1), then (1), Finance_Approval (1), satisfied (1), total (1), amount (1), > (1), €10,000 (1). That's maybe 12 words. Good.

But maybe better to be clear: "R1 Compliant - Manager approval followed by Finance approval for amount > €10,000." That's 13? Let's count: R1 (2), Compliant (1), - (1), Manager (1), approval (1), followed (1), by (1), Finance (1), approval (1), for (1), amount (1), > (1), €10,000 (1). That's 13 words. Good.

R2: If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval. The last required approval is Finance_Approval at step 3. Ship_Goods is step 5, which is 1 day after. So compliant.

Justification: "R2 Compliant - Ship_Goods within 2 days after Finance approval for expedited order."

Count: R2 (2), Compliant (1), - (1), Ship_Goods (1), within (1), 2 (1), days (1), after (1), Finance (1), approval (1), for (1), expedited (1), order (1). That's 13 words.

R3: Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods. In the trace, Pay_Invoice occurs at step 7 (2025-03-06) and Receive_Goods at step 6 (2025-03-07). So Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods. Violated.

Justification: "R3 Violated - Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods violates rule requiring Pay_Invoice after goods receipt."

Count: R3 (2), Violated (1), - (1), Pay_Invoice (1), before (1), Receive_Goods (1), violates (1), rule (1), requiring (1), Pay_Invoice (1), after (1), goods (1), receipt (1). That's 13 words.

R4: If hazardous = true, Safety_Inspection must occur after Receive_Goods and before Store_Goods. In this case hazardous = false, so rule not applicable.

Justification: "R4 Not Applicable - hazardous flag false, so Safety_Inspection not required."

Count: R4 (2), Not (1), Applicable (1), - (1), hazardous (1), flag (1), false (1), so (1), Safety_Inspection (1), not (1), required (1). That's 11 words.

R5: If Change_Request happens after any approval, new Manager_Approval must be obtained before further processing. Change_Request after Finance_Approval, but no new Manager_Approval before Ship_Goods. Violated.

Justification: "R5 Violated - Change_Request after Finance approval but no new Manager_Approval before Ship_Goods."

Count: R5 (2), Violated (1), - (1), Change_Request (1), after (1), Finance (1), approval (1), but (1), no (1), new (1), Manager_Approval (1), before (1), Ship_Goods (1). That's 13 words.

R6: Every case must terminate with Archive_Record. The case ends with Archive_Record. Compliant.

Justification: "R6 Compliant - Archive_Record occurs at end of case after all processing steps."

Count: R6 (2), Compliant (1), - (1), Archive_Record (1), occurs (1), at (1), end (1), of (1), case (1), after (1), all (1), processing (1), steps (1). That's 13 words.

Now overall result: NON-COMPLIANT.

Thus final output:

R1: Compliant - Manager_Approval then Finance_Approval (≤20 words)
R2: Compliant - Ship_Goods within 2 days after Finance approval (≤20)
R3: Violated - Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods (≤20)
R4: Not Applicable - hazardous flag false (≤20)
R5: Violated - Change_Request after Finance approval but no new Manager_Approval before Ship_Goods (≤20)
R6: Compliant - Archive_Record at end (≤20)

Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT

We must ensure we don't add extra text. The user wants the answer format: list of rule results with justifications, then the final result. So we should output exactly that.

We also need to ensure we don't include any extra commentary or explanation. The answer should be concise.

Thus final answer.

R1: Compliant - Manager approval followed by Finance approval for amount > €10,000.  
R2: Compliant - Ship_Goods within 2 days after Finance approval for expedited order.  
R3: Violated - Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods violates rule requiring Pay_Invoice after goods receipt.  
R4: Not Applicable - hazardous flag false, so Safety_Inspection not required.  
R5: Violated - Change_Request after Finance approval but no new Manager_Approval before Ship_Goods.  
R6: Compliant - Archive_Record at end of case after all processing steps.  

Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT
