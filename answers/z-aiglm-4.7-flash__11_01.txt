**Subject:** Bottleneck Analysis

This analysis identifies **Request_Documents** (36.5h/120h), **Assess_Liability** (7.8h/16.4h), and **Send_Closure_Letter** (12.2h/44h) as the top three waiting-time bottlenecks.

To cut waiting time by ≥20% for each:
1.  **Request_Documents:** Integrate API connections with external insurer portals for real-time auto-downloading, eliminating manual lookup latency.
2.  **Assess_Liability:** Mandate digital evidence attachment during claim entry to prevent required document re-submissions.
3.  **Send_Closure_Letter:** Switch to immediate email notifications to bypass physical postal transmission delays.
