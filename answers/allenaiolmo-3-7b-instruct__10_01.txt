Certainly. Here is the RACI matrix for the **Order-to-Cash** process using your required terminology:

| Activity | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Receive Application | C | A | A | R |
| KYC Review | R | A | R | R |
| Order Vetting | A | R | C | R |
| Payment Clearance | R | R | A | R |
| Record Update | R | R | R | A |
| Notify Customer | A | R | R | R |

**Legend (for clarity, though not requested):**  
A = Accountable  
R = Responsible  
C = Consulted  
I = Informed
