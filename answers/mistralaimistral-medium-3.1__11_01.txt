**To:** Orion Insurance COO
**From:** Process-Mining Team
**Subject:** Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Mitigation Actions

**Key Findings:** The three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:

1. **Request_Documents**
   - *Avg wait:* **36.5h** | *95th %:* **120h**
   - **Action:** Implement automated document reminders (SMS/email) triggered at 24h delays, paired with a self-service portal for uploads. *Projected impact:* ≥25% reduction via proactive nudges.

2. **Send_Closure_Letter**
   - *Avg wait:* **12.2h** | *95th %:* **44h**
   - **Action:** Batch-process letters hourly (vs. current EOD) and auto-escalate delays >12h. *Projected impact:* ≥30% faster turnaround.

3. **Assess_Liability**
   - *Avg wait:* **7.8h** | *95th %:* **16.4h**
   - **Action:** Pre-assign cases to adjudicators based on claim type (e.g., auto vs. property) to eliminate queue randomness. *Projected impact:* ≥20% wait-time cut.

**Data source:** 12-month process logs (275–320 executions/activity). Prioritize #1—its 95th-percentile wait (5 days!) dwarfs all others.
