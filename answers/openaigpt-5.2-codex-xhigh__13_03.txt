1️⃣ **1** occurrence.

2️⃣ This excerpt covers only three cases from a short time window on March 1. A single “Manual Fraud Check” here doesn’t represent the full month’s volume. Other cases and days are missing, so the rate could be higher or lower overall. Also, fraud checks appear with different labels (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check,” “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), suggesting naming variation that could hide manual checks in the full log. With such a small, partial sample, frequency estimates are unreliable.
