No, the fact is **inaccurate**.

In **Case 1001**, **Update_Inventory** occurs at 08:25:55, immediately *before* **Authorize_Refund** (08:30:02), which is the reverse of the claimed order. Similarly, in **Case 1003**, **Update_Inventory** (10:08:07) precedes **Authorize_Refund** (10:22:18). Therefore, **Authorize_Refund** does not occur immediately before **Update_Inventory**.
