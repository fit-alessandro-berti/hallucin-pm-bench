**No**. The fact is inaccurate because Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order within the same case. In case C003 (lines 6-7), Validate_Payment occurs first at line 6, before Receive_Order at line 7. Similarly, in case C005 (lines 11-12), Validate_Payment at line 11 precedes Cancel_Order at line 12 with no prior Receive_Order in that case. While it holds for cases C001 (lines 1-2), C002 (lines 3-5), and C004 (lines 8-9), the counterexamples in C003 and C005 disprove the "always" claim.
