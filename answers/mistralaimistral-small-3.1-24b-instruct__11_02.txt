**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review and Recommendations

Our Q1-2025 claims handling process review identifies three activities with significant performance issues: Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment.

1. **Request_Documents**
   - **Issue:** High `avg_wait_time_min` (150 min) and a high `rework_rate_pct` (22.0%) indicate significant inefficiencies and repeated work.
   - **Recommendation:** Implement an automated follow-up system to remind customers and internal teams to prioritize document requests, reducing wait times and minimizing rework.

2. **Review_Documents**
   - **Issue:** High `avg_wait_time_min` (30 min), high `avg_processing_time_min` (25 min), and a notable `stdev_processing_time_min` (9 min) signify bottlenecks and inconsistent processing times.
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct root cause analysis to streamline document review procedures, possibly introducing digital tools or AI to standardize and expedite the process.

3. **Initial_Assessment**
   - **Issue:** Elevated `avg_wait_time_min` (18 min) and a higher-than-average `sla_breach_pct` (3.2%) suggest delays and frequent breaches in service-level agreements.
   - **Recommendation:** Reallocate resources or prioritize this activity to reduce wait times and ensure more consistent compliance with processing time benchmarks.

Addressing these areas will enhance overall claims handling efficiency, reducing backlog and improving customer satisfaction.
