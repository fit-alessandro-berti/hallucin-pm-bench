**1.** The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in the fragment.  

**2.** The fragment contains **18** logged events.  
\[
\frac{1}{18}\times100 = 5.555\ldots\% \;\approx\; \mathbf{5.56\%}
\]  
So it represents **5.56 %** of all logged events (rounded to two decimal places).  

**3.** The case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.  

**4.** Two sampling‑related reasons why estimating a monthly frequency of manual fraud checks from this fragment is unreliable:  

1. **Very small sample size** – The fragment contains only 18 events (one day of activity). Such a tiny sample cannot capture the natural variability of manual‑fraud‑check occurrences over an entire month, leading to high statistical uncertainty.  

2. **Temporal bias (single‑day snapshot)** – All events are recorded on a single date (2025‑05‑01). Business volume, fraud‑risk patterns, and operational procedures can change across days, weeks, or seasonal periods. Relying on one day’s data ignores these temporal fluctuations, so the resulting monthly estimate is likely to be biased.
