The fact is not accurate based on the provided event-log fragment.

Justification:

Let’s examine each case in the event-log:

*   **Case 1001:** “Authorize_Refund” (08:45:12) occurs before “Update_Inventory” (08:30:02).
*   **Case 1002:** “Authorize_Refund” (10:25:10) occurs before “Refund_Issued” (10:25:10) – there is no “Update_Inventory” activity in this case.
*   **Case 1003:** “Authorize_Refund” (10:15:42) occurs before “Quality_Check” (10:22:18). There is no “Update_Inventory” activity in this case.

Because “Update_Inventory” does not consistently occur immediately *before* “Authorize_Refund” across all cases, the claim is false.
