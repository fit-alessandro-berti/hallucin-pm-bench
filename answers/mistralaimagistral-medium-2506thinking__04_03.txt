# Compliance Assessment

**Trace ID 2025-05-RX17**

**Compliance Rules Analysis**

Trace: `<create_case, capture_event_details, Quality_Engineer_Review, Notify_Authorities, Regulatory_Affairs_Review, VP_Safety_Approval, Close_Case>`

**Ruleset Requirements Evaluation:**

1. **Quality_Engineer_Review and Regulatory_Affairs_Review Order**:
   Both activities appear, with `Quality_Engineer_Review` (step 3) occurring before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (step 5). ✅

2. **High Severity Case Requires VP Approval**:
   Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` must occur after both QE and RA. In the trace, `VP_Safety_Approval` is at step 6, following QE at step 3 and RA at step 5. ✅

3. **Notify_Authorities Timing**:
   `Notify_Authorities` occurs at step 4. However, `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` completes at step 5. Therefore, `Notify_Authorities` occurs before both QE and RA are complete, violating this rule. ❌

4. **Close_Case Timing**:
   `Close_Case` (step 7) occurs after `Notify_Authorities` (step 4) and `VP_Safety_Approval` (step 6). ✅

**Conclusion:** The trace is **not compliant** with ruleset R due to a violation of rule 3.

**Final Answer:** No. The trace violates Rule 3. `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete.

\boxed{No}
