Answer: The claim is **FALSE**.

**Case 1003** shows the activity order **Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund**, with **Update_Inventory** occurring **after** the refund. Thus, “Authorize_Refund” does **not** always occur immediately before “Update_Inventory” within the same case.

**Relevant case IDs and activities**: **1003** (Quality_Check before Authorize_Refund, then Update_Inventory).
