**No**

Justification:  
- Rule 1 requires QE and RA to occur once each and in that order. Here, QE occurs before RA, which satisfies rule 1.  
- Rule 2 requires VP to occur after both QE and RA (since severity="High"). Here, VP occurs after both, which satisfies rule 2.  
- Rule 3 requires NA to occur only after both QE and RA are complete. Here, NA occurs after QE but *before* RA, which violates rule 3.  
- Rule 4 requires CC to occur after NA (and VP, if required). Here, CC occurs after both, but since rule 3 is violated, the trace is non-compliant.  

The violation of rule 3 (NA occurring before RA is complete) makes the trace non-compliant.
