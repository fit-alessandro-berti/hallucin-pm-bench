Alright, let’s go step-by-step.

## 1. Restating the question in Petri-net terms

We have a **safe** Petri net, meaning each place can hold at most one token in any reachable marking. The starting marking is:

```
M₀: p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0
```

Transitions:

1. **T1:**  p0 → p1 + p2  (parallel split: consumes p0 token, produces tokens simultaneously in p1 and p2)
2. **T2:**  p1 → p3
3. **T3:**  p2 → p4
4. **T4:**  p3 + p4 → p5  (synchronising join: both tokens required at p3 & p4)
5. **T5:**  p3 –|p4 → p6  (*normal arc* from p3, *inhibitor arc* from p4; consumes p3 and only enabled if p4 is empty)

---

## 2. Understanding the condition “T5 before T3”

We want:  
Is there a reachable marking where **T5 fires first (i.e. before any T3 firing)**?

Formally: in a firing sequence from M₀, the first appearance of T5 should occur strictly before the first occurrence of T3.

---

## 3. Check enabling rules

Let’s see what must hold for T5 to fire:

- Normal arc from *p3*: p3 must have a token.
- Inhibitor arc from *p4*: p4 must be **empty**.

To have p3=1, either:
- T2 fires (p1→p3).
And for empty p4, T3 must **not have fired** yet (because T3: p2→p4).

---

## 4. Step-by-step exploration

**Initial state** M₀:
```
p0=1
```
Only **T1** is enabled (since it needs p0).

---

### Step 1: Fire T1:
```
M₁: p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, others=0
```
Enabled now:
- T2 (p1→p3) possible
- T3 (p2→p4) possible

---

To get T5 before T3, we must **not** fire T3 yet.  
Instead, fire T2 to get p3=1.

---

### Step 2: Fire T2:
```
M₂: p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0
```
Now:
- T3 is enabled (p2 token → p4) but we don't want it yet if we want T5 before T3.
- **T5** is enabled: p3=1, inhibitor from p4 satisfied (p4=0).

---

**Thus, we can fire T5 immediately, before touching T3.**

### Step 3 (the point of interest): Fire T5:
```
M₃: p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p6=1
```
At this point, T5 has fired and T3 has not yet fired.

---

### Step 4: Later we can fire T3 (optional now), etc.

---

## 5. Example firing sequence

From M₀:
```
M₀ —T1→ M₁ —T2→ M₂ —T5→ M₃ —T3→ …
```
Symbolically: **T1, T2, T5, T3, …**

---

## 6. Conclusion

✅ **Yes** — It is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Concrete sequence:**
```
T1: p0 → p1+p2
T2: p1 → p3
T5: p3 –|p4 → p6
T3: p2 → p4    (comes later)
```

**Justification:**  
After T1 then T2, p3=1 and p4=0. The inhibitor condition for T5 is satisfied, enabling it before T3 has been fired.

---

**Answer:**
> **Yes.** Example firing sequence from the initial marking: `T1, T2, T5, T3, …`. After `T1` and `T2`, place p3 has a token and p4 is empty, enabling T5 before T3 fires.

Would you like me to also **enumerate all reachable markings** to verify no subtle constraints prevent this?
