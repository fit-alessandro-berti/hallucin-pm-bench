Based solely on the provided process description, here are the decision points and required documents:

**Decision Points:**
1.  **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility:** The triage agent decides if the claim is eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.
2.  **Finance_Controller_PreApprove:** The finance controller decides whether to pre-approve the refund using the *EligibilityChecklist*.
3.  **High-value branch decision:** Implicitly, the system/process must decide if the refund amount is **greater than €1 000** to trigger the *Senior_Auditor_Review* step. (This decision point is inherent in the branch condition).

**Required Documents:**
1.  **RefundRequestForm** (Submitted by customer in step 1)
2.  **FlightManifest** (Used in step 2)
3.  **WeatherReport** (Used in step 2)
4.  **EligibilityChecklist** (Used in step 3)
5.  **AuditTrail** (Required in step 4 - Senior_Auditor_Review)
6.  **BankTransferAuthorization** (Required in step 5 - Process_Refund_Payment)
7.  **RefundConfirmationPDF** (Generated in step 6)

**Key Notes:**
*   The decision points are the steps where an agent or the system must make a judgment or evaluation (*Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*, *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*) or where a condition is checked to determine the process path (high-value branch decision).
*   All listed documents are explicitly mentioned in the process steps.
*   No other decision points or documents are introduced beyond those defined.
