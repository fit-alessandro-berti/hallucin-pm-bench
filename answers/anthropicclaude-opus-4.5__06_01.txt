I need to analyze Process B (Manufacturing_WorkOrder) to identify all pairs of tasks that can execute in parallel.

Let me trace through Process B:

1. **Create_Work_Order** - starts the process
2. **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** - can run simultaneously after Create_Work_Order
3. **Fabricate** - only after BOTH Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines complete
4. **Quality_Check** and **Create_Documentation** - begin in parallel right after Fabricate
5. **Package** - starts when BOTH Quality_Check and Create_Documentation are finished
6. **Dispatch_to_Customer** - follows Package
7. **Close_Work_Order** - completes the process

Now identifying parallel pairs:

**Pair 1:** Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines can run simultaneously (explicitly stated in step 2)

**Pair 2:** Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel (explicitly stated in step 4)

Now I need to format these alphabetically:
- Within each pair (alphabetical order of task names)
- Overall list (alphabetical order by first task)

Pair 1: Create_Documentation comes before Quality_Check alphabetically
Pair 2: Procure_Materials comes before Schedule_Machines alphabetically

Ordering the pairs by first task:
- Create_Documentation — Quality_Check (C comes first)
- Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines (P comes second)

```
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
```
