## Answer 2: Why This Snippet Can Mislead (118 words)

A snippet containing only 14 events across 3 cases provides insufficient statistical grounding. First, selection bias: this excerpt may not represent typical loan volume or seasonal patterns. Second, case-level variation: Case 1002 required manual review before manual fraud checking, while Cases 1001 and 1003 bypassed it entirely—these different routes aren't visible in isolation. Third, rarity estimation: if manual fraud checks occur only for high-risk applications, their true frequency in a full month (with thousands of cases) could be substantially higher or lower than the 7.1% observed here. Without knowing total case volume and case-type distribution, extrapolating prevalence from this tiny sample is unreliable.
