R1: **Compliant** — Amount €12,450; Manager_Approval (03-03) followed by Finance_Approval (03-04) occurred.  
R2: **Violated** — Expedited; Ship_Goods occurred before required re-Manager_Approval after Change_Request, not after last required approval.  
R3: **Violated** — Pay_Invoice (03-06 09:00) occurred before Receive_Goods (03-07 14:13).  
R4: **Not Applicable** — hazardous = false, so no Safety_Inspection requirement.  
R5: **Violated** — Change_Request after approvals; Ship_Goods happened before new Manager_Approval, violating “before any further processing step”.  
R6: **Compliant** — Case ends with Archive_Record (last event).  

Overall result: **NON-COMPLIANT**
