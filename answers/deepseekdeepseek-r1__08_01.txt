**Yes**, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.  

**Concrete firing sequence**:  
1. **T1 fires**: Consumes the token in p0, producing tokens in p1 and p2.  
   *Marking*: p1(1), p2(1).  

2. **T2 fires**: Consumes the token in p1, producing a token in p3.  
   *Marking*: p2(1), p3(1).  

3. **T5 fires**: T5 is enabled *only if* p4 has no tokens (which is true here) and p3 has a token (which is true). Firing T5 consumes the token in p3, producing a token in p6.  
   *Marking*: p2(1), p6(1).  

**Justification**:  
- After T1 fires, both p1 and p2 hold tokens.  
- Firing T2 (before T3) creates a state where p3 has a token, while p4 remains empty (T3 has not fired).  
- In this state, T5â€™s conditions are satisfied: p3 has a token (normal arc) and p4 is empty (inhibitor arc). T5 can thus fire before T3.
