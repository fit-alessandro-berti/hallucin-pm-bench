1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** in this fragment.

2. There are 18 total logged events. This represents **5.56%** of all logged events. ([1/18]*100 = 5.56)

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:

    - **The sample size is extremely small**: With only 18 log lines, the data set is too small to make reliable estimates about the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks.

    - **The time period covered is too short**: The fragment covers only a single day's worth of activities, which may not be representative of the variations that occur within a month.
