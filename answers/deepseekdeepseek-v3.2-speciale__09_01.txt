The requested average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the provided data.  

**Explanation:**  
The event log excerpt contains only case identifiers, activity names, and resources. Timestamps and any elapsed-time fields have been redacted, meaning there is no information about when activities started or ended. Without timing data, it is impossible to compute the duration (cycle time) of any activity instance. The historical benchmark values refer to a different customer segment and do not include “Review Contract,” so they cannot be used to estimate the missing values. Therefore, the average cycle time cannot be calculated.
