### 1. Frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check"

**Exactly 1 time.**

It appears in a single log line:
`A1002,2025-05-01T10:50:00,Manual_Fraud_Check`

### 2. Percentage of all logged events

There are **18** total events in the fragment.

$$\frac{1}{18} \times 100 = \mathbf{5.56\%}$$

### 3. Case identifier(s) containing "Manual_Fraud_Check"

| Case |
|------|
| **A1002** |

That is the only case.

### 4. Two sampling-related reasons the monthly-frequency estimate would be unreliable

1. **Tiny, non-representative sample size (small-n problem):** The fragment contains only 18 events across 4 cases, all recorded within a single day (2025-05-01). A single day's worth of data is far too small to capture the true variability of fraud-check occurrences over an entire month. The observed count of 1 has an extremely wide confidence interval, making any extrapolation to a monthly figure statistically unreliable.

2. **Temporal selection bias (non-random time window):** The fragment covers only a narrow, contiguous time window on one calendar day rather than being a random or stratified sample drawn from across the full month. Fraud-check frequency may vary systematically by day-of-week, time-of-month (e.g., pay periods, promotional events), or seasonal patterns. Because the sample is confined to a single short period, it cannot account for this temporal variation and may systematically over- or under-estimate the true monthly rate.
