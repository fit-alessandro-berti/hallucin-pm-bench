### Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Analysis

**To: COO, Acme Insurance**  
**From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst**  
**Date: April 15, 2025**  
**Subject: Key Bottlenecks in Claims Handling Process**

Based on Q1-2025 dashboard data, the three worst-performing activities are Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment. These were selected due to their combination of highest wait times, rework rates, and SLA breaches, which collectively hinder overall throughput and efficiency.

1. **Request_Documents**: Underperforms with the highest avg_wait_time_min (150) and rework_rate_pct (22.0%), indicating severe queuing delays and frequent repetitions, alongside a high sla_breach_pct (5.5%). This bottlenecks the process, reducing throughput to 190 cases/day. **Recommendation**: Implement automated document requests via customer portal to cut wait times by targeting the 150-minute queue, based on observed delays.

2. **Review_Documents**: Shows the highest avg_processing_time_min (25), stdev_processing_time_min (9), rework_rate_pct (5.3%), and sla_breach_pct (12.4%), reflecting prolonged, variable execution with quality issues. Throughput drops to 185 cases/day. **Recommendation**: Standardize review checklists to reduce stdev_processing_time_min from 9 to under 5 minutes, directly addressing variability and breaches.

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Exhibits the highest avg_wait_time_min (18) among early activities and elevated sla_breach_pct (3.2%) with rework_rate_pct (1.8%), causing early pipeline slowdowns (throughput 270 cases/day). **Recommendation**: Allocate additional staff to slash wait times from 18 to under 10 minutes, leveraging the moderate 12-minute processing time to prevent downstream impacts.

Addressing these will improve end-to-end efficiency. Further analysis recommended if needed.
