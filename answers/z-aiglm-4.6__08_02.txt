**1. Yes.**

**2.** A minimal firing sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. T1 creates tokens in P1 and P2. To enable T5, a token must be placed in P5 via T4. The token for T4 can be generated through the P1→P3→P4 path (by firing T2 and T7), completely bypassing T3. After the sequence T1, T2, T7, T4, the marking is {P2, P5}. At this state, T5 is enabled and can fire before T3.
