No. T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

Reason: T5 requires a token in p3 and zero tokens in p4 (due to the inhibitor). The only way to put a token in p3 is to fire T2, which first requires T1 to fire to produce a token in p1. But T1 also simultaneously produces a token in p2. From that point on, p2 remains marked until T3 fires (the net is safe and there is no other consumer of p2). Therefore, when p3 is marked (after T2), p4 is still unmarked only until T3 fires; however, the presence of the token in p2 means T3 is enabled and, once it fires, it puts a token in p4, immediately disabling T5. Since p4 was zero only before T3, but at that time p3 was not yet marked (before T2), there is no marking where both p3 has a token and p4 has zero tokens after T1. Thus T5 can never be enabled before T3 fires, and hence cannot fire before T3.
