## 2. Percentage Calculations

| Metric | Numerator | Denominator | Percentage |

| a) All events | 1 | 48 | **2.08%** |
| b) All unique cases | 1 | 12 | **8.33%** |

## 3. Why Low-Support Activities Mislead Analysis

An activity occurring only once (2.08% of events, 8.33% of cases) introduces severe statistical sparsity. Performance metrics based on this slice (e.g., average processing time for manual checks) are unreliable single observations. Predictive models trained on such data may overfit to noise, incorrectly flagging normal claims as high-risk if manual checks are rare in the broader population. Generalizing from this slice risks mistaking this edge case for a pattern, leading to flawed process optimizations or inaccurate fraud predictions.
