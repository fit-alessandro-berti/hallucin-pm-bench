Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Key Performance Hotspots

Based on Q1 data, the three worst-performing activities are:

1) Request_Documents  
- Underperformance: Sharp throughput drop (270 → 190), extremely high wait time (150 min), highest rework rate (22%), and elevated SLA breaches (5.5%).  
- Action: Standardize document requirements and automate document reminders/collection to reduce rework and queueing.

2) Review_Documents  
- Underperformance: Lowest throughput among upstream steps (185), long wait (30 min), very high processing time (25 min) with high variability (stdev 9), and highest SLA breach rate (12.4%).  
- Action: Introduce clear assessment checklists and targeted training; route complex cases to specialists to cut variability and SLA breaches.

3) Initial_Assessment  
- Underperformance: Early bottleneck with notable throughput drop (280 → 270), elevated wait (18 min), moderate processing time (12 min) and variability (stdev 4), and SLA breaches (3.2%) higher than most downstream steps.  
- Action: Implement triage rules and capacity alignment at intake to shorten queues and stabilize assessment times.
