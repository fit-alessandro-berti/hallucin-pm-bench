Alright, let's tackle these questions one by one using only the provided event log fragment.

### Q1: How many distinct case IDs appear in the fragment?

First, I'll go through each event and list out the case IDs:
1. A-9321
2. A-9321
3. B-1045
4. B-1045
5. A-9321
6. B-1045
7. B-1045
8. A-9321
9. B-1045
10. C-77

Now, let's identify the unique case IDs:
- A-9321
- B-1045
- C-77

That's 3 distinct case IDs.

### Q2: Which activity immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case A-9321?

Looking at case A-9321, I need to find the event that happens right before "Ship_Order". Let's list all events for A-9321 in order of their timestamps:

- 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00: Receive_Order
- 2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00: Validate_Order
- 2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00: Pack_Items
- 2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00: Ship_Order

The event immediately before "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items".

### Q3: What is the earliest timestamp in the fragment?

I'll look at all the timestamps across all events:

1. 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00
2. 2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00
3. 2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00
4. 2025-04-14T08:17:00.000+00:00
5. 2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00
6. 2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00
7. 2025-04-14T09:10:00.000+00:00
8. 2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00
9. 2025-04-14T09:25:00.000+00:00
10. 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00

The earliest one is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00.

### Q4: How many times does the activity "Quality_Check" occur?

Let's go through each event's "concept:name" where the value is "Quality_Check":

1. B-1045: Quality_Check (occurrence 1)
2. C-77: Quality_Check (occurrence 2)

So, it occurs 2 times.

### Q5: List every activity that never appears as the first event of any case.

First, I need to identify the first event for each case.

- For Case A-9321:
  - First event: Receive_Order (at 08:02)

- For Case B-1045:
  - First event: Receive_Order (at 08:05)

- For Case C-77:
  - First event: Quality_Check (at 10:00) â€” this is the only event for this case

Activities in the log:
- Receive_Order
- Validate_Order
- Pack_Items
- Quality_Check
- Ship_Order

Activities that are first events:
- Receive_Order (for A-9321 and B-1045)
- Quality_Check (for C-77)

Activities that are not first events:
- Validate_Order
- Pack_Items
- Ship_Order

Therefore, the activities that never appear as the first event of any case are "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", and "Ship_Order".

### Compiling the JSON Response

Now, let's put it all together in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Pack_Items",
  "Q3": "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00",
  "Q4": 2,
  "Q5": ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]
}
```

I've verified each answer against the event log fragment, ensuring that all responses are based solely on the provided information.
```json
{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Pack_Items",
  "Q3": "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00",
  "Q4": 2,
  "Q5": ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]
}
```
