Non-compliant  

1. Rule 2: Because `Expedite_Flag` occurs (#4), `Risk_Assessment` must appear before the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace `Ship_Goods` is at step 8 and `Risk_Assessment` only at step 9, so the ordering requirement is violated.  
2. Rule 3: `Three_way_match` must occur within two activities after `Goods_Received` (#6). The two subsequent activities are #7 (`Move_to_Quality`) and #8 (`Ship_Goods`); `Three_way_match` only appears at #10, i.e., four steps later. This exceeds the allowed distance.
