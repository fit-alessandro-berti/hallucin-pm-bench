**Q1.** No, **T5** cannot fire before **T3**. For **T5** to fire, both **P2** and **P5** must be marked. **P5** is only marked after **T4** fires, which requires **T3** to have fired (to mark **P4**). Thus, **T3** must fire before **T5**.

**Q2.** No such sequence exists due to the dependency chain: **T1 → T3 → T4 → T5**.
