The fact is **not accurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification:**
- For **Case 1001**:  
  - Activities: `Update_Inventory` occurs at 08:25:55  
  - `Authorize_Refund` occurs at 08:30:02  
  - **`Authorize_Refund` does NOT occur immediately before `Update_Inventory`**; `Update_Inventory` precedes `Authorize_Refund`.

- For **Case 1002**:  
  - `Authorize_Refund` at 10:11:00  
  - `Update_Inventory` at 10:18:40  
  - Again, `Authorize_Refund` occurs after `Update_Inventory`.

- For **Case 1003**:  
  - `Update_Inventory` at 10:08:07  
  - `Authorize_Refund` at 10:15:42  
  - `Authorize_Refund` occurs after `Update_Inventory`.

**Conclusion:**  
The claim that “Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory” is **false**, as in all cases `Update_Inventory` precedes `Authorize_Refund`.
