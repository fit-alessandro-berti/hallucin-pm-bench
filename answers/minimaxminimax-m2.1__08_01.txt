Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in some reachable marking.

### Concrete Firing Sequence:
Start from the initial marking \( M_0 = (p_0=1, p_1=0, p_2=0, p_3=0, p_4=0, p_5=0, p_6=0) \).

1. **Fire T1**:  
   - Consumes token from \( p_0 \), produces tokens to \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \).  
   - Resulting marking: \( M_1 = (p_0=0, p_1=1, p_2=1, p_3=0, p_4=0, p_5=0, p_6=0) \).  

2. **Fire T2**:  
   - Consumes token from \( p_1 \), produces token to \( p_3 \).  
   - Resulting marking: \( M_2 = (p_0=0, p_1=0, p_2=1, p_3=1, p_4=0, p_5=0, p_6=0) \).  

3. **Fire T5** (before T3):  
   - Enabled because \( p_3 \) has a token (normal arc) and \( p_4 \) has 0 tokens (inhibitor arc satisfied).  
   - Consumes token from \( p_3 \), produces token to \( p_6 \).  
   - Resulting marking: \( M_3 = (p_0=0, p_1=0, p_2=1, p_3=0, p_4=0, p_5=0, p_6=1) \).  

4. **Fire T3**:  
   - Now fire T3 (consumes token from \( p_2 \), produces token to \( p_4 \)).  
   - Resulting marking: \( M_4 = (p_0=0, p_1=0, p_2=0, p_3=0, p_4=1, p_5=0, p_6=1) \).  

### Justification:
- After firing T1 and T2 (steps 1 and 2), we reach marking \( M_2 \), where \( p_3 \) has a token and \( p_4 \) is empty.  
- T5 is enabled in \( M_2 \) due to the inhibitor arc from \( p_4 \) (which has 0 tokens) and the normal arc from \( p_3 \).  
- Firing T5 in step 3 produces a token in \( p_6 \) and consumes the token from \( p_3 \), leaving \( p_4 \) still empty.  
- T3 is fired only afterward in step 4, confirming that T5 can indeed fire before T3.  

Thus, the firing sequence \( T1, T2, T5, T3 \) demonstrates that T5 can fire before T3.
