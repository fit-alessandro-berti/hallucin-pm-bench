No

**Justification:**
The statement is incorrect because there are instances where other activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," or where the order of these activities is reversed.

*   **Case C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → **`Pack_Items`** → `Validate_Payment`. Here, "Pack_Items" is performed immediately after receiving the order, not "Validate_Payment."
*   **Case C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → **`Check_Fraud`** → `Validate_Payment`. Here, "Check_Fraud" intervenes between the receipt of the order and the payment validation.
