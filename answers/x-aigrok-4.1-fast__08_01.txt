**No**, it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

**Proof:**

- T5 requires **p3 ≥ 1** and **p4 = 0** (via inhibitor arc).
- The **only** way to get a token in p3 is by firing **T2**.
- T2 requires firing **T1** first (since p1 starts empty).
- Firing T1 also puts a token in **p2**.
- The **only** way to remove the token from p2 is by firing **T3**.

Thus, in any reachable marking with **p3 ≥ 1** (enabling T5), we must have **already fired T1 → T2**, so **p2 ≥ 1**. This means **p4 = 0** (T5's inhibitor condition) holds **only if T3 has already fired** to consume p2's token.

**T5 cannot fire before T3**—it requires T3 to have fired first to satisfy p4 = 0.
