1️⃣ The activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the prevalence of manual fraud checks because the sample is limited and not representative of the entire month-long log. The small number of cases (only three complete cases shown) may not reflect the frequency of manual checks across all cases. If this snippet happens to include fewer manual fraud checks than typical, one might underestimate their overall occurrence; conversely, if it includes more, they might overestimate. Without a comprehensive view, the analyst cannot determine the true proportion of manual fraud checks relative to other activities or total cases, leading to potential misinterpretation of process behavior.
