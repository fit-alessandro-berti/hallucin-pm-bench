**TO:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**SUBJECT:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Brief  

**Worst-Performing Activities:**  

1. **Request_Documents**  
   - **Why:** Highest wait time (150 min) indicates bottlenecks in document collection, likely due to manual steps or dependencies on external parties. Rework rate (22%) suggests frequent errors or incomplete submissions.  
   - **Action:** Implement automated document request system with real-time status tracking to reduce wait times and improve accuracy.  

2. **Review_Documents**  
   - **Why:** Highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and processing variability (stdev 9 min) signal inconsistent review quality and capacity issues.  
   - **Action:** Develop a standardized checklist and mandatory training for reviewers to reduce variability and improve consistency.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - **Why:** High wait time (18 min) suggests capacity constraints. SLA breach rate (3.2%) and rework rate (1.8%) indicate inexperienced staff or unclear guidelines.  
   - **Action:** Balance workload across experienced staff and provide targeted training to reduce rework and wait times.
