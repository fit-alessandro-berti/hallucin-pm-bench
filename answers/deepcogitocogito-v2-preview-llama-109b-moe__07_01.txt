Okay, let's tackle this BPMN comparison. I need to look at both XML snippets and list the factual differences under the specified headings: Added tasks, Removed tasks, and Gateway type changes.

First, I'll start by comparing the tasks present in each version. In BPMN_v1, there's receive_request, validate_warranty, approve_return, send_rma_label, and reject_return. In BPMN_v2, we have receive_request, check_vip, validate_warranty, approve_return, generate_qr, and reject_return. So, send_rma_label is in v1 but not in v2, which means it's removed. On the other hand, check_vip and generate_qr are in v2 but not in v1, so they are added.

Next, looking at gateways. In v1, there's an exclusiveGateway with id gw_valid. In v2, it's an inclusiveGateway with the same id. That's a change in gateway type.

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other tasks or gateway changes. Let me double-check. The sequences and flows are different, but the tasks and gateways are what matter for these categories. No other tasks seem to be added or removed beyond what I've noted.

So, compiling the list:
- Added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr
- Removed tasks: send_rma_label
- Gateway type changes: exclusiveGateway changed to inclusiveGateway on gw_valid
• Added tasks  
  - check_vip  
  - generate_qr  

• Removed tasks  
  - send_rma_label  

• Gateway type changes  
  - The gateway with id="gw_valid" changed from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`
