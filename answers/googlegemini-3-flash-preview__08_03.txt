Based on the net specification provided, the answer is **yes**.

It is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**. In fact, if the "shortcut" transition **T2b** is used, transition **T3** may never fire at all.

### Shortest Firing Sequence
One of the shortest sequences where **T5** fires before **T3** (which does not fire at all in this sequence) is:
1.  **T1**
2.  **T2b**
3.  **T4**
4.  **T5**

### Step-by-Step Execution:
1.  **Initial Marking:** `[p0=1]`
2.  **Fire T1:** Consumes `p0`, produces `pa` and `pb`. (Marking: `[pa=1, pb=1]`)
3.  **Fire T2b:** Consumes `pa`, produces `pd`. This bypasses `pc` and therefore skips the requirement for **T3** to fire. (Marking: `[pb=1, pd=1]`)
4.  **Fire T4:** Consumes `pb`, produces `pe`. (Marking: `[pd=1, pe=1]`)
5.  **Fire T5:** Consumes `pd` and `pe`, produces `pf`. (Marking: `[pf=1]`)

**Conclusion:** At this point, **T5** has fired, while **T3** has not. Because **T2b** and **T2** are in conflict for the token at `pa`, choosing the shortcut path (**T2b**) fulfills the input requirement for **T5** (place `pd`) without ever enabling or firing **T3**.
