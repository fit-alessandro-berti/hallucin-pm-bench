Here's the specific improvement to enforce the SLA, using only existing elements:

```xml
<boundaryEvent id="Boundary_01" cancelActivity="true" attachedToRef="Activity_CreateAccount">
  <timerEventDefinition>
    <timeDuration>PT48H</timeDuration>
  </timerEventDefinition>
</boundaryEvent>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_09" sourceRef="Boundary_01" targetRef="Activity_AMReview"/>
```

Justification: This adds a timer boundary event to "Create Account in Core System" that escalates to the existing "Account-Manager Review" task after 48 hours, enforcing the SLA without introducing new activities.
