Attach an **interrupting boundary timer event** to **Task_RequestDocs** that is due at **Start_Claim + 48 hours** (use a *timeDate* expression based on the submission timestamp). If the timer fires, **cancel Task_RequestDocs** and route via a new sequenceFlow straight to **Task_Triage**, setting an “escalated/high priority” flag. If documents arrive in time, the existing flow **f6** completes **Task_RequestDocs** and continues normally to **Task_Triage**.
