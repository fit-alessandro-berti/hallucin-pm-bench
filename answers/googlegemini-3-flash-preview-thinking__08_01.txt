**Yes**, it is possible for transition $T_5$ to fire before transition $T_3$.

### Concrete Firing Sequence
1.  **$M_0 \xrightarrow{T_1} M_1$**: $p_0$ fires, putting one token in **$p_1$** and one token in **$p_2$**.
2.  **$M_1 \xrightarrow{T_2} M_2$**: $p_1$ fires, moving its token to **$p_3$**.
3.  **$M_2 \xrightarrow{T_5} M_3$**: With a token in $p_3$ and **zero** tokens in $p_4$ (since $T_3$ has not yet fired), the inhibitor arc condition is satisfied. $T_5$ fires, consuming the token from $p_3$ and placing one in $p_6$.

### Justification
Transition $T_5$ requires a token in $p_3$ and an empty place at $p_4$. Because the parallel split ($T_1$) enables both the $T_2 \rightarrow p_3$ branch and the $T_3 \rightarrow p_4$ branch independently, it is possible for $T_2$ to complete while $T_3$ is still "pending" (i.e., the token is still sitting in $p_2$). Since $p_4$ remains empty until $T_3$ fires, the inhibitor arc does not block $T_5$, allowing it to fire before $T_3$ ever executes.
