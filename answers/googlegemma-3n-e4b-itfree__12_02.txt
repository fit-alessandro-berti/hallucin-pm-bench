No.

The fact that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order* is not accurate. Case ID C003 shows that *Receive_Order* (line 7) is followed by *Validate_Payment* (line 7), which confirms the claim for that case. However, Case ID C004 shows that *Receive_Order* (line 8) is followed by *Validate_Payment* (line 9), also confirming the claim. However, Case ID C005 shows *Validate_Payment* (line 11) is followed by *Cancel_Order* (line 12) which does not follow *Receive_Order*. Therefore, the statement is incorrect because the log fragment contains instances where *Validate_Payment* does not immediately follow *Receive_Order*.
