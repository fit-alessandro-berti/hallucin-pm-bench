**TO:** COO, Orion Credit
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Critical Process Performance Review

Analysis of recent throughput data identifies Risk Review, Credit Assessment, and Verify Identity as the three worst-performing activities when considering both SLA excursions and high waiting times. Risk Review exhibits the highest Avg\_Waiting\_Time at 480 seconds and exceeds its Target\_SLA[s] of 300 seconds by 180 seconds. Credit Assessment shows a substantial Avg\_Throughput\_Time of 300 seconds and exceeds its Target\_SLA[s] of 240 seconds by 60 seconds. Verify Identity demonstrates an Avg\_Waiting\_Time of 80 seconds against a Target\_SLA[s] of 90 seconds; however, its Avg\_Throughput\_Time of 120 seconds already breaches the 90-second SLA by 30 seconds, complemented by the second-highest Avg\_Waiting\_Time of 80 seconds among the top three.

Recommendations based solely on throughput and waiting time metrics are as follows:

*   **Risk Review:** Target the 480 seconds in Avg\_Waiting\_Time for optimization, as this value is the highest across all activities.
*   **Credit Assessment:** Focus process improvement efforts to reduce the 300 seconds Avg\_Throughput\_Time to align with the 240-second Target\_SLA[s].
*   **Verify Identity:** Address the 80 seconds Avg\_Waiting\_Time, which contributes significantly alongside the 120 seconds Avg\_Throughput\_Time.
