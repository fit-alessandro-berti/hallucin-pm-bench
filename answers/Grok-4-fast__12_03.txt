In CaseID C002, the sequence is Receive_Order followed by Pack_Items, then Validate_Payment, so Pack_Items occurs in between. In CaseID C004, the sequence is Receive_Order followed by Check_Fraud, then Validate_Payment, so Check_Fraud occurs in between. While Validate_Payment immediately follows Receive_Order in CaseIDs C001 and C003, the presence of intervening activities in C002 and C004 means the fact does not hold universally across all cases.
