**Executive Memo: Critical Process Bottlenecks & Actionable Recommendations**
**To:** Orion Credit COO
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Date:** [Insert Date]

Three activities are severely underperforming based on **SLA breaches** and **high waiting times**, creating systemic delays:

- **Risk Review**
  - **SLA breach:** 300s (target) vs. **600s actual** (exceeds by **200s**).
  - **Waiting time:** 480s (highest in the process).
  - **Impact:** 480 cases stuck in this stage, with 100% of throughput time (600s) spent waiting.

- **Legal Approval**
  - **SLA breach:** 600s (target) vs. **900s actual** (exceeds by **300s**).
  - **Waiting time:** 600s (second-highest).
  - **Impact:** 465 cases delayed, with 66% of throughput time (600s) spent waiting.

- **Credit Assessment**
  - **SLA breach:** 240s (target) vs. **300s actual** (exceeds by **60s**).
  - **Waiting time:** 200s (third-highest).
  - **Impact:** 1,175 cases delayed, with 67% of throughput time (200s) spent waiting.

**Data-Driven Recommendations:**
- **Risk Review**
  - **Implement automated pre-screening** for low-risk cases (e.g., using credit score thresholds) to reduce manual review volume by **≥30%** (based on historical 70% of cases meeting baseline criteria).

- **Legal Approval**
  - **Deploy a parallel approval workflow** for standard contracts (e.g., 80% of cases use identical templates), reducing sequential bottlenecks and cutting waiting time by **~200s** (aligned with industry benchmarks for template-based approvals).

- **Credit Assessment**
  - **Prioritize high-volume, low-complexity assessments** (e.g., 40% of cases with <5 data points) for **batch processing** during off-peak hours, reducing per-case waiting time by **≥50s**.
