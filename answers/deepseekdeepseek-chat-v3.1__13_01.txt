Let's address each question step by step based solely on the provided log fragment:

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occur in this fragment?**  
   - The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears only once (in Case A1002 at 2025-05-01T10:50:00).  
   - Answer: **1**

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
   - Total events: 18  
   - Occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check": 1  
   - Percentage: (1 / 18) * 100 â‰ˆ 5.56%  
   - Answer: **5.56%**

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check".**  
   - Only case A1002 contains "Manual_Fraud_Check".  
   - Answer: **A1002**

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   - **Reason 1:** The fragment covers only a short time window (about 5 hours on a single day). It may not represent the entire month (e.g., seasonal variations, daily fluctuations).  
   - **Reason 2:** The sample size is very small (only 4 cases), and only one fraud check occurred. This is insufficient to generalize for a monthly estimate (high variance and potential bias).  
   - Answer:  
        **(i) The data is limited to a short time span (one day) and may not capture monthly patterns.**  
        **(ii) The sample has too few cases (only 4) and events (only one fraud check), leading to high uncertainty.**

**Summary of Answers:**  
1. 1  
2. 5.56%  
3. A1002  
4. (i) The data is limited to a short time span (one day) and may not capture monthly patterns.  
   (ii) The sample has too few cases (only 4) and events (only one fraud check), leading to high uncertainty.
