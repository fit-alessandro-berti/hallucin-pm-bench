**Question 1.**
Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

**Question 2 (bonus).**
A minimal firing sequence that demonstrates this is:
**[ T1, T2, T7, T4, T5 ]**

For T5 to fire, it requires tokens in P2 and P5. The token in P2 is created by the initial AND-split (T1). The token for P5 must be created by T4.

Crucially, T4 is enabled by a token in P4, which can be produced by *either* T3 or T7. By choosing the path through T2 and T7, we can create the token in P4 without firing T3. T4 then fires, enabling T5. T5 can then fire, consuming the token from P2 before T3 ever does.
