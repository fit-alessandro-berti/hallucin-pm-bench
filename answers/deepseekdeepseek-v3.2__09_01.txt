The average cycle time for the activity "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the provided data.

**Explanation:**  
The event log only includes activity names and resources, with timestamps and elapsed-time fields redacted. Cycle time calculations require duration data for each instance of the activity, which is not available in this log. The historical benchmark data is explicitly stated to be from a different source and cannot be applied to the given log. Therefore, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time for "Review Contract" based on the information provided.
