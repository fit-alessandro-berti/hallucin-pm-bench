**Question 1:** Based on the provided log fragment, the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs exactly once.  
**Answer:** 1  

**Question 2:** To calculate the percentage of all logged events that "Manual_Fraud_Check" represents, first, the total number of logged events is 18. Since "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs once, the percentage is (1 / 18) * 100 â‰ˆ 5.555...%. Rounded to two decimal places, it is 5.56%.  
**Answer:** 5.56%  

**Question 3:** The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is A1002.  
**Answer:** A1002  

**Question 4:** Using only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable due to sampling-related issues:  
1. **Temporal bias:** The fragment covers a short time period (approximately part of a single day on May 1, 2025) and does not account for variations that may occur over the course of a full month, such as different days of the week, weekends, holidays, or seasonal changes, which could affect the frequency of manual fraud checks.  
2. **Insufficient sample size:** The fragment contains only 18 events from 4 cases, which is too small a sample for accurate estimation over a monthly period. This can lead to high variability and increased uncertainty, as random fluctuations in the data may not reflect the true underlying frequency in the process.
