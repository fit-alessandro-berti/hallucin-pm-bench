 **Yes.**

**Concrete firing sequence:**  
`T1 → T2 → T5`

**Justification:**  
1. After firing **T1**, the marking is `{p1, p2}` (one token in each).  
2. Firing **T2** consumes the token from `p1` and produces one in `p3`.  
   The current marking is `{p2, p3}`; place `p4` is still empty.  
3. At this marking, transition **T5** is enabled because:
   - It has a normal input token from `p3` (present), and
   - Its inhibitor arc from `p4` is satisfied (`p4` contains **zero** tokens).  
   Meanwhile, **T3** is also enabled (token in `p2`), but we may choose to fire **T5** first.  

Since **T5** can fire while `p4` remains empty and before the token from `p2` is moved to `p4` by **T3**, it is indeed possible for **T5** to fire before **T3**.
