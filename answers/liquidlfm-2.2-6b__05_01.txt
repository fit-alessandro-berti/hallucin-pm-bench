To meet the 48-hour SLA without adding tasks, introduce a **delayed event** named `Delay_Start` with an initial delay of 24 hours (from `Start_Claim`), and connect it via a sequence flow `f10` to `Task_Check`. In `Task_Check`, set a **direct business rule**: if `Entry.Name` contains "-Delay_Start", flag the claim and route it to `Task_Triage` automatically. This ensures claims delayed event must move to triage after delay, effectively enforcing the SLA by reducing wait time and triggering automatic triage. Key elements: `Task_Check`, `Delay_Start`, sequence flow `f10`.
