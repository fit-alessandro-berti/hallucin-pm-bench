**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance**

**Key Underperformers:**
1. **Request_Documents**
   - *Why*: Highest `avg_wait_time_min` (150) and `rework_rate_pct` (22.0%), indicating inefficiencies in document collection and frequent rework.
   - *Action*: Implement automated document request tracking with real-time status alerts to reduce wait times and rework.

2. **Review_Documents**
   - *Why*: Longest `avg_processing_time_min` (25) and high `sla_breach_pct` (12.4%), suggesting bottlenecks in document review.
   - *Action*: Deploy AI-assisted document review tools to expedite processing and reduce SLA breaches.

3. **Notify_Customer**
   - *Why*: While metrics are strong, its throughput (179/day) lags behind earlier steps (e.g., 280/day for *Register_Claim*), creating a potential backlog.
   - *Action*: Automate customer notifications to align throughput with upstream activities.

*Note*: Other activities (e.g., *Initial_Assessment*) show moderate wait times but lack clear evidence of being the worst performers.
