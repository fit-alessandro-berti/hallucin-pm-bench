1) The average cycle time for the activity "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the given data.

2) Explanation:  
To calculate the average duration (cycle time) of an activity, timestamps for activity start and completion are required. The provided event log has timestamps and elapsed-times explicitly redacted, offering only the sequence of activities and the associated resources. Without timestamps, start-and-end points, or explicit activity duration, the calculation of the "Review Contract" average cycle time is impossible.
