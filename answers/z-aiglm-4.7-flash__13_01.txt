4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.
*   **Insufficient Sample Size:** The fragment contains only 4 cases, meaning the presence of a single "Manual_Fraud_Check" event accounts for a large proportion of the data (50% of cases), making the estimate statistically volatile and unstable.
*   **Lack of Temporal Representativeness:** The data is limited to a single day (May 1st). Monthly estimates assume a trend or average over 30 days; the occurrence of fraud is likely influenced by cyclical factors (e.g., weekends, month-end processing) that a one-day sample cannot capture.
