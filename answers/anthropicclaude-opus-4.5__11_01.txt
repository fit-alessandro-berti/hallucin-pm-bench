**EXECUTIVE MEMO**

**To:** COO, Orion Insurance  
**From:** Process Mining Analytics  
**Re:** Top 3 Activities by Waiting Time – Findings & Recommendations

---

**Ranked by Average Waiting Time (Worst → Best):**

| Rank | Activity | Avg Wait | 95th %ile Wait |
|------|----------|----------|----------------|
| #1 | Request_Documents | 36.5 h | 120.0 h |
| #2 | Send_Closure_Letter | 12.2 h | 44.0 h |
| #3 | Assess_Liability | 7.8 h | 16.4 h |

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Request_Documents:** Deploy automated customer portal with SMS/email reminders and pre-populated document checklists—targeting ≥20% reduction through faster customer response.

2. **Send_Closure_Letter:** Implement event-triggered auto-generation of closure letters immediately upon final decision, eliminating manual queue delays.

3. **Assess_Liability:** Introduce workload-balancing algorithm to redistribute cases when adjuster queues exceed 4-hour threshold, reducing bottleneck wait.
