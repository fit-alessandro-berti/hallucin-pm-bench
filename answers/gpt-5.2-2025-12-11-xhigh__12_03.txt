1. **No.**

2. The excerpt contains cases where **other activities occur between** “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment”:

- **C002:** `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  (“Pack_Items” occurs in between, so Validate_Payment is **not** immediately after Receive_Order.)

- **C004:** `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  (“Check_Fraud” occurs in between, so Validate_Payment is **not** immediately after Receive_Order.)

Only **C001** (`Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`) and **C003** (`Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order`) match the claimed pattern, so the “always” statement is not supported.
