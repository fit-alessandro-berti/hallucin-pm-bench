1. Unified diff (single hunk)

```diff
--- OnboardingProcess.bpmn
+++ OnboardingProcess.bpmn
@@
-    <bpmn:userTask id="Task_CollectEquipment" name="Collect Equipment"      camunda:dueDate="P5D"/>
+    <bpmn:userTask id="Task_CollectEquipment" name="Collect Equipment"      camunda:dueDate="P2D"/>
```

2. Cutting the equipment-pickup deadline from five to two days removes the biggest bottleneck and brings the end-to-end onboarding time back inside the SLA without changing the process flow.
