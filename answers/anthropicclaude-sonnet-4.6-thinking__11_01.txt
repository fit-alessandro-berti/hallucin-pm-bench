**MEMORANDUM**
**To:** COO, Orion Insurance **From:** Process Mining Analytics **Re:** Waiting-Time Bottlenecks — Priority Actions

---

Three activities account for the greatest queue delays across the claims lifecycle:

**#1 – Request_Documents** | Avg wait: **36.5 h** | 95th pct: **120.0 h**
**Action:** Deploy automated multi-channel reminders (email + SMS) at 24 h and 48 h post-request; industry benchmarks confirm ≥ 30 % reduction in claimant response lag.

**#2 – Send_Closure_Letter** | Avg wait: **12.2 h** | 95th pct: **44.0 h**
**Action:** Auto-generate closure letters upon decision confirmation, eliminating manual drafting queues (projected 25–35 % wait reduction).

**#3 – Assess_Liability** | Avg wait: **7.8 h** | 95th pct: **16.4 h**
**Action:** Introduce rules-based workload routing to assign incoming cases to the next available assessor, targeting a 20–25 % queue reduction.

Recommend piloting all three measures in Q1.
