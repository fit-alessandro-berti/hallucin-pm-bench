Let’s check each rule in order.

---

**Rule 1:**  
PO amount = €12 300 (>€10 000) ⇒ needs **two** approvals (Procurement Officer then CFO) **before** `Issue_PO`.  
Trace: `Approve_PO` (PO role) at #2 → `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO role) at #3 → `Issue_PO` at #5.  
✅ Rule 1 satisfied.

---

**Rule 2:**  
`Expedite_Flag` is present at #4.  
- `Quality_Check` becomes optional (not in trace at all — allowed).  
- `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** first `Ship_Goods`.  
`Ship_Goods` at #8, `Risk_Assessment` at #9 ⇒ occurs **after**, not before.  
❌ Rule 2 violated.

---

**Rule 3:**  
`Goods_Received` at #6 ⇒ `Three_way_match` must occur **within the next 2 activities** (i.e., at #7 or #8).  
`Three_way_match` is at #10 ⇒ distance from #6 to #10 is 4 steps (6→7, 7→8, 8→9, 9→10).  
❌ Rule 3 violated.

---

**Rule 4:**  
No Intern activity **directly after** CFO activity.  
CFO activity at #3, next activity at #4 is System ⇒ no violation.  
Intern activity at #7, previous activity at #6 is Warehouse_Clerk ⇒ no violation.  
✅ Rule 4 satisfied.

---

**Rule 5:**  
Trace ends with `Archive_Record` at #11, nothing after.  
✅ Rule 5 satisfied.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Multiple violations (Rule 2 and Rule 3).

**Answer:**
```
Non-compliant
1. Rule 2: Risk_Assessment must occur before Ship_Goods when Expedite_Flag is present, but here Risk_Assessment (#9) occurs after Ship_Goods (#8).
2. Rule 3: Three_way_match (#10) occurs more than 2 activities after Goods_Received (#6).
