**a) Decision points:**

- After the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, if the risk rating is Low or Medium *and* the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, then skip the Manual-Underwriting-Review (step 5); otherwise, proceed to step 5.
- At the TriVote Decision-Gate (step 6), the process passes if the loan receives approvals from any two out of the three required roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer).
