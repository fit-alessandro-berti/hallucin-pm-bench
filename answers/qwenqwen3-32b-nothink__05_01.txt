Add a **timer intermediate catch event** on the outgoing flow from `Task_Triage` (e.g., after `f5` and `f6`), routed to a new **intermediate throw event** connected to an external **escalation event**. However, since we cannot add new activities, instead configure a **timed boundary event** on `Task_Triage` with a 48-hour timer to trigger escalation if the task isnâ€™t reached in time. This ensures the SLA is enforced **without new tasks**, leveraging existing elements like `Task_Triage` and existing flows like `f5`, `f6`, and `f7`.
