The fact is **not accurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification:**
- In **Case 1001**: “Authorize_Refund” occurs **after** “Update_Inventory”, not before.
- In **Case 1002**: There is **no “Update_Inventory”** activity at all, so the stated order is not applicable.
- In **Case 1003**: “Update_Inventory” occurs **before** “Authorize_Refund”, with an intermediate activity “Quality_Check” between them.

Therefore, “Authorize_Refund” does **not** always occur immediately before “Update_Inventory” in any case in this fragment.
