Non-compliant

1. Rule 3 is violated: After `Goods_Received`, activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance â‰¤ 2). In the trace, `Risk_Assessment` occurs between `Goods_Received` and `Three_way_match`, making the distance 2, which is acceptable. However, the sequence of activities after `Goods_Received` is `Move_to_Quality`, `Ship_Goods`, `Risk_Assessment`, and then `Three_way_match`. The `Three_way_match` should have occurred immediately after `Goods_Received` or at most after one other activity, but it occurs after three other activities.

2. Rule 3 is violated: Activity `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs before `Risk_Assessment`, which violates this rule.
