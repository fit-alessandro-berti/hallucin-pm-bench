Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3.

ðŸ”¹ Shortest firing sequence showing that T5 can fire before T3:

T1 â†’ T2b â†’ T4 â†’ T5

ðŸ“˜ Explanation:
Starting from the initial marking: p0 = 1

1. T1 fires: consumes token from p0, produces tokens in pa and pb  
   Marking: pa = 1, pb = 1

2. T2b fires: consumes token from pa, produces token in pd  
   Marking: pb = 1, pd = 1

3. T4 fires: consumes token from pb, produces token in pe  
   Marking: pd = 1, pe = 1

4. T5 fires: consumes tokens from pd and pe, produces token in pf  
   Marking: pf = 1

âž¡ Transition T3 has not fired at any point in this sequence, yet T5 was able to fire because its input places pd and pe had tokens produced via T2b (for pd) and T4 (for pe), thus showing that T5 can fire before T3.
