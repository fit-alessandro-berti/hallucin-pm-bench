Okay, let's compare these two BPMN XML snippets step by step to identify all changes according to the required categories. 

First, I need to look for any tasks that were added in version 2 that weren't in version 1. Then, check if any tasks were removed. Finally, see if there are any gateway type changes. Let's go through each category one by one.

**Added Tasks:**
Comparing the `<task>` elements in both versions:
- In `RMA_v1`: 
  - receive_request
  - validate_warranty
  - approve_return
  - send_rma_label
  - reject_return
- In `RMA_v2`:
  - receive_request
  - check_vip (new)
  - validate_warranty
  - approve_return
  - generate_qr (new)
  - reject_return

So, in `RMA_v2`, there are two tasks that weren't present in `RMA_v1`:
1. `check_vip` (name: "Check Customer VIP Status")
2. `generate_qr` (name: "Generate RMA QR Code")

**Removed Tasks:**
Now, looking at tasks present in `RMA_v1` but not in `RMA_v2`:
- `send_rma_label` (name: "Send RMA Label") is present in `RMA_v1` but not in `RMA_v2`.
- The rest were either present in both or added in `RMA_v2`.

**Gateway Type Changes:**
Next, checking the gateway elements:
- In `RMA_v1`: There's an exclusiveGateway with id `gw_valid` and name "Warranty Valid?".
- In `RMA_v2`: The gateway with the same id `gw_valid` is now an inclusiveGateway.
- The id and name are the same, but the type has changed from exclusive to inclusive.

This is a change in the gateway's type from exclusive to inclusive while keeping the same id and name.

**Other Changes:**
- The sequenceFlow IDs have changed in some cases (e.g., `f3` to `f4` in connections), but we are only concerned with tasks and gateway types as per the categories.
- No changes to gateways in terms of addition or removal; only the type changed.

**Summary:**
- **Added tasks:** `check_vip` and `generate_qr`
- **Removed tasks:** `send_rma_label`
- **Gateway type changes:** `gw_valid` changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway.

There are no other relevant changes to mention under these specific categories. The rest of the process elements like start events, end events, and sequence flows (aside from renumbering) are consistent between versions, so they don't fall into the required change types.
• **Added tasks**  
  check_vip  
  generate_qr  

• **Removed tasks**  
  send_rma_label  

• **Gateway type changes**  
  gw_valid: Changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway
