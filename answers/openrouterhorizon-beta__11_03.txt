COO,

Based on the provided operational data, the three worst-performing activities—considering both SLA breaches and high waiting times—are Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment.

Risk Review averages 600 seconds of throughput time against a 300-second SLA, exceeding its target by 300 seconds, with a high average waiting time of 480 seconds across 480 cases. Legal Approval averages 900 seconds against a 600-second SLA, exceeding by 300 seconds, with a waiting time of 600 seconds across 465 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300 seconds against a 240-second SLA, exceeding by 60 seconds, with a waiting time of 200 seconds across 1,175 cases.

Recommendations:
• Risk Review: Introduce a prioritization queue to reduce the 480-second average waiting time for the 480 cases.  
• Legal Approval: Allocate additional approval capacity during peak demand to lower the 600-second average waiting time across 465 cases.  
• Credit Assessment: Streamline pre-assessment checks to cut the 200-second average waiting time across 1,175 cases and close the 60-second SLA gap.
