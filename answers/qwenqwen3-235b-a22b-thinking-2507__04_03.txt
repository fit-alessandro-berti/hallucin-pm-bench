**No**  

**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1:** Satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` (step 3) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (step 5), and both appear exactly once.  
- **Rule 2:** Satisfied. Severity is "High", and `VP_Safety_Approval` (step 6) occurs after both `QE` (step 3) and `RA` (step 5).  
- **Rule 3:** **Violated.** `Notify_Authorities` (step 4) occurs *before* `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (step 5). Rule 3 requires NA to happen *only after both QE and RA are complete*â€”here, RA is not complete at the time of NA.  
- **Rule 4:** Satisfied. `Close_Case` (step 7) occurs after `Notify_Authorities` (step 4) and `VP_Safety_Approval` (step 6), as required for high-severity cases.  

The violation of Rule 3 alone makes the trace non-compliant.
