**1. Occurrences of “Manual_Fraud_Check”**  
- The activity appears **once** (case C05).

**2. Percentages**  
- a) Events: \( \frac{1}{48}\times100 = 2.08\% \) (rounded to two decimals)  
- b) Unique cases: \( \frac{1}{12}\times100 = 8.33\% \) (rounded to two decimals)

**3. Why a low‑support activity can be misleading (≤ 100 words)**  
When an activity occurs in only a few events or cases, its performance metrics (e.g., duration, cost, success rate) are based on an extremely small sample. Generalising these metrics to the whole process inflates variance and may suggest patterns that are not representative of typical claims. Predictive models trained on such sparse data can over‑fit the rare occurrence, leading to inaccurate forecasts for most cases and potentially misguided resource allocation or risk‑assessment decisions.
