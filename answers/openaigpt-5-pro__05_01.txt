Add SLA timer boundaries to the pre-triage path. Attach an interrupting Timer Boundary Event (timeDate = Start_Claim occurrence + PT48H) to Task_Receive, Task_Check, and Task_RequestDocs. Each timer’s sequence flow should go directly to Task_Triage. If the claim hasn’t reached Task_Triage within 48 hours of submission, whichever activity is active is aborted and the case is auto‑escalated into triage. Normal flows (f4–f7) continue for on‑time cases. No new tasks or subprocesses are added—only boundary events and sequence flows. This ensures every claim reaches Task_Triage within the SLA.
