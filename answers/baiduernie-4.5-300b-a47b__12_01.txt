The fact is **not accurate**.  

- **Case 1001**: "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02) occurs *after* "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55), not before.  
- **Case 1002**: "Authorize_Refund" (10:18:40) occurs without a subsequent "Update_Inventory" activity in the log fragment.  
- **Case 1003**: "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18) occurs *after* "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07), not before.  

No case in the provided fragment shows "Authorize_Refund" immediately preceding "Update_Inventory"; the reverse occurs in two cases, and one case lacks "Update_Inventory" entirely.
