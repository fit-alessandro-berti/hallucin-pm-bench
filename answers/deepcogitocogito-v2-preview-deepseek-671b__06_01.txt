I need to analyze Process B (Manufacturing_WorkOrder) to identify all pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel based on the process description.

Let's break down Process B's structure:
1. Create_Work_Order (must complete before others start)
2. After Create_Work_Order finishes, Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines can run simultaneously
3. Fabricate starts only after both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines finish
4. After Fabricate finishes, Quality_Check and Create_Documentation run in parallel
5. Package starts after both Quality_Check and Create_Documentation finish
6. Dispatch_to_Customer follows Package
7. Close_Work_Order follows Dispatch_to_Customer

From this, I can identify the following parallel task pairs:
- Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines (explicitly stated they may run simultaneously)
- Quality_Check and Create_Documentation (explicitly stated to begin in parallel)

Now I need to list these pairs in alphabetical order both within pair and in the overall list:

First pair alphabetically: 
Create_Documentation — Quality_Check 
(they are executed in parallel)

Second pair:
Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

Note: I'm ignoring Process A completely as instructed. The only parallel tasks in Process B are these two pairs.
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check  
Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
