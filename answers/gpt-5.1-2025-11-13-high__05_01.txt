Attach a non-interrupting timer boundary event to “Request Missing Docs” (id=Task_RequestDocs).  

Configure the boundary timer (e.g., id=Timer_SLA_48h, cancelActivity="false") with timeDuration = "PT48H" (48 hours from submission, using the submitted timestamp set at Start_Claim).  

Route the timer’s outgoing sequence flow to a new escalation end event (e.g., id=End_SLA_Escalated).  

If the claim is still in Task_RequestDocs 48 hours after submission (i.e., has not yet reached Task_Triage), the boundary event fires and automatically escalates the case, while the normal path to Task_Triage remains unchanged.
