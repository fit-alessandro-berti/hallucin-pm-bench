Let's analyze the given XES event log fragment step by step.

---

### **Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

We look at the `case` attribute in each event:

- Line 1: C001  
- Line 2: C002  
- Line 3: C001  
- Line 4: C003  
- Line 5: C002  
- Line 6: C003  
- Line 7: C001  
- Line 8: C002  
- Line 9: C003  
- Line 10: C002  

Unique case IDs: **C001, C002, C003**

✅ **Answer: 3**

---

### **Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

We extract all events for case **C002** and sort them by timestamp:

- Line 2: `Receive_Order` — 2025-03-01T09:15:10  
- Line 5: `Check_Stock` — 2025-03-01T09:22:55  
- Line 8: `Arrange_Delivery` — 2025-03-01T10:15:20  
- Line 10: `Ship_Order` — 2025-03-01T10:25:40  

Order by time:  
**Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

✅ **Answer: Receive_Order→Check_Stock→Arrange_Delivery→Ship_Order**

---

### **Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**

We need to find, for **each occurrence** of `Ship_Order`, what the **immediately preceding activity** was in the same case.

We’ll go case by case:

#### Case C001:
Events:
- Receive_Order (09:12:00)  
- Check_Stock (09:20:05)  
- Ship_Order (10:05:10) ← **preceded by Check_Stock**

→ Predecessor: **Check_Stock**

#### Case C002:
Events:
- Receive_Order (09:15:10)  
- Check_Stock (09:22:55)  
- Arrange_Delivery (10:15:20)  
- Ship_Order (10:25:40) ← **preceded by Arrange_Delivery**

→ Predecessor: **Arrange_Delivery**

#### Case C003:
Events:
- Receive_Order (09:21:30)  
- Check_Stock (09:25:05)  
- Ship_Order (10:20:30) ← **preceded by Check_Stock**

→ Predecessor: **Check_Stock**

---

So, all immediate predecessors of `Ship_Order` are:
- Check_Stock (from C001 and C003)
- Arrange_Delivery (from C002)

Distinct predecessors: **Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock**

Alphabetically ordered:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

✅ **Answer:**
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```

---

### ✅ Final Answers:

**Q1:** 3  
**Q2:** Receive_Order→Check_Stock→Arrange_Delivery→Ship_Order  
**Q3:**  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
