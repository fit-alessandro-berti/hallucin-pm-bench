Add an intermediate timer boundary event to `Task_RequestDocs` with a 48-hour duration. If the claim remains in `Task_RequestDocs` without completing within 48 hours, the timer triggers escalation to `Task_Triage`, bypassing the wait period. This ensures the claim reaches "Triage Claim" (via `f6`) within SLA without adding tasks. The timer replaces manual handoff, making the process self-correcting for delays in document submission.
