## 4. Two Sampling-Related Reasons Why the Monthly Estimate is Unreliable

1. **Insufficient sample size / Short observation window:**  
   The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01) with just 4 cases. A one-day snapshot is not representative of typical monthly behavior; seasonal patterns, day-of-week effects, and weekly cycles cannot be detected from such limited data.

2. **Selection bias / Non-random sampling:**  
   There is no evidence that these 18 events were randomly selected from the full month's activity. If this fragment represents only certain types of orders, time periods, or transaction values, it may overrepresent or underrepresent the true frequency of manual fraud checks. For example, if fraud checks are triggered by specific risk factors, a day with one high-risk order is not necessarily typical of all days.
