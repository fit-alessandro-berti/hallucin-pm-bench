**No**

Justification:
- **Rule 1 (QE before RA, once each):** Violated – `Notify_Authorities` occurs **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
- **Rule 2 (VP after QE & RA for High severity):** Satisfied – VP occurs after both QE and RA.
- **Rule 3 (NA after QE & RA):** Violated – NA occurs **before** RA.
- **Rule 4 (CC after NA & VP if required):** Satisfied – CC occurs after both NA and VP.
