**Non-compliant**

1.  **Violation of Rule 2:** The trace contains the activity `Expedite_Flag` (Event #4). According to the rule, if this flag is present, `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at Event #8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs at Event #9, which is after the shipment has already taken place.
2.  **Violation of Rule 3:** Activity `Goods_Received` occurs at Event #6. Rule 3 mandates that `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (i.e., at Event #7 or #8). In this trace, `Three_way_match` occurs at Event #10, which is a distance of 4 activities, exceeding the allowed limit.
