**MEMORANDUM**  
TO: Chief Operating Officer  
FROM: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
SUBJECT: Critical SLA Breaches and Waiting Time Analysis  

Analysis reveals three activities with severe SLA breaches and elevated waiting times:  
- **Risk Review**: Throughput exceeds SLA by 300s (600s vs. 300s), with waiting time of 480s.  
- **Legal Approval**: Throughput exceeds SLA by 300s (900s vs. 600s), with waiting time of 600s.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Throughput exceeds SLA by 60s (300s vs. 240s), with waiting time of 200s.  

**Recommendations**:  
- • For Risk Review: Analyze queue bottlenecks to reduce waiting time.  
- • For Legal Approval: Allocate additional resources to decrease waiting time.  
- • For Credit Assessment: Investigate handoff inefficiencies to lower waiting time.
