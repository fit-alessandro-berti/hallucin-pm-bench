1. **1**
2. **5.56%** (1 manual fraud check / 18 total events)
3. **A1002**
4. **Two sampling-related reasons for unreliability:**
    *   **Insufficient Sample Size:** The log fragment contains only 18 events and 4 cases, which is too small to represent statistically significant patterns or seasonal variations required for a monthly estimate.
    *   **Temporal Bias (Short Duration):** The data covers a span of only five hours on a single day (09:00 to 14:05). This "snapshot" cannot account for fluctuations in fraud frequency that might occur at different times of the month, during peak shopping hours, or on weekends.
