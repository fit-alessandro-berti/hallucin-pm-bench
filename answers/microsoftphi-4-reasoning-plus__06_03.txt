User instructions state: Focusing only on Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment, list each set tasks that can execute concurrently. The process B is. The text: 

```
Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment (supplier-to-shelf)
    1. Start
    2. Receive_Stock
    3. || Parallel Split #1 ||
         • Quality_Check
         • Update_Inventory
    4. || Merge #1 ||
    5. Store_Items
    6. || Parallel Split #2 ||
         • Generate_Replenishment_Report
         • Notify_Procurement
    7. || Merge #2 ||
    8. End
```

We are specifically focus on Process B only. And user instruction says: focusing only on Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment, list each set of tasks that can execute concurrently. It instructs: "list each set tasks that can execute concurrently (i.e., tasks that lie on different branches of the same parallel construct)", but then said: "Number the sets in the order they appear in the process and give no information about Processes A or C."

So the user is asking: specifically using Process B. And specifically list only the sets tasks that are executed concurrently (parallel splits) "in the same parallel construct". The design parts in Process B as indicated are:

Inside Process B:
- At number 3 line, there is "|| Parallel Split #1 ||" then list tasks: "• Quality_Check, • Update_Inventory" then line 4: "|| Merge #1 ||"
- Then step 5: "Store_Items" (not in a parallel split, but a serial step)
- Then step 6: "|| Parallel Split #2 ||" then list tasks: "• Generate_Replenishment_Report, • Notify_Procurement" then step 7: "|| Merge #2 ||"
- Step 8 "End".

So they ask then: "list each set tasks that can execute concurrently" i.e. tasks that are inside parallel splits. So set being in parallel #1, set tasks: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory. And also set tasks in parallel #2: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement.

So answer should be:
1. In the first parallel split: tasks "Quality_Check" and "Update_Inventory".
2. In the second parallel split: tasks "Generate_Replenishment_Report" and "Notify_Procurement".

We number them in order they appear in the process. So answer: "Set #1: tasks: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory; Set #2: tasks: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement". 
Since we must list "each set of tasks" meaning direction: Possibly "Set 1: ..." "Set 2: ..." Perhaps using bullets? But the instruction says "Number the sets in the order they appear in the process". I must list exactly tasks maybe with "1. Quality_Check and Update_Inventory", "2. Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement". And must include no referencing of Process A or Process C. So only Process B.

I must include no details of the business process flows from A or C.

Thus I produce answer, following directives "Focusing only on Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment" that list each set tasks concurrently. Note that user says "list each set of tasks that can execute concurrently (i.e., tasks that lie on different branches of the same parallel construct)". There are two parallel constructs. In Process B definition, Step 3 includes parallel construct "Parallel Split #1", step 6 includes parallel construct "Parallel Split #2". So that's the answer.

Double-check sequences: The process: Start, then Receive Stock, then (Parallel Split #1: Quality_check and Update inventory concurrently) then Merge #1 -> Store items -> (Parallel Split #2: Generate replenishment report and Notify procurement concurrently) then Merge #2 -> End.

Thus answer: First concurrent group (Parallel Split #1) tasks: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory. Second concurrent group (Parallel Split #2) tasks: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement.

I must present answer without including unnecessary context. I'll produce my answer lines with numbering:
1. From Parallel Split #1: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory.
2. From Parallel Split #2: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement.

I must ensure to specify them as "concurrently".

I'll produce answer in my plain language with steps: "1. Quality_Check and Update_Inventory, 2. Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement."

I'll produce the answer answer.

I'll produce answer in my own words and then verification.
Yes.

I'll produce answer as: "1. Quality_Check and Update_Inventory (from Parallel Split #1), 2. Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement (from Parallel Split #2)".

I'll produce answer not as a statement including process. No mention of process A or C. No details aside from these sets.

I'll produce answer: "For Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment, the following sets of tasks run concurrently: 
Set 1: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory.
Set 2: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement."

I'll produce answer message only these. 
I'll then produce answer.

I'll produce answer now in plain text.Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment includes two parallel constructs where tasks can run concurrently:

1. Parallel Split #1: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory  
2. Parallel Split #2: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement
