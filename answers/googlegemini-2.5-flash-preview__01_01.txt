Here are the decision points in Contoso's flight-refund process, along with the required documents for each:

*   **Decision Point:** Is the refund amount greater than â‚¬1,000?
    *   **Required Documents (if Yes):** AuditTrail
    *   **Required Documents (if No):** *None listed as specifically required *at this decision point*.*

**Summary of All Document Requirements:**

While the decision point only explicitly lists `AuditTrail` as required based on the outcome, the process definition mentions the following documents being used by activities:

*   RefundRequestForm
*   FlightManifest
*   WeatherReport
*   EligibilityChecklist
*   AuditTrail (used in the high-value branch)
*   BankTransferAuthorization (required before `Process_Refund_Payment`)
*   RefundConfirmationPDF (generated in `Issue_Confirmation_Letter`)
