# Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Date:** Q1-2025
**Subject:** Claims Process Performance Review – Priority Interventions Required

**Analysis Summary**

Three activities require immediate attention based on the Q1 dashboard:

**1. Request_Documents** exhibits the most severe performance gaps. With an average wait time of 150 minutes—8× higher than any other activity—it functions as a critical bottleneck. Additionally, its 22.0% rework rate is 12× the process average, indicating systemic quality issues in initial document requests. **Recommendation:** Implement mandatory document checklists at the Initial Assessment stage to reduce downstream rework, and parallelize request generation to eliminate the queue bottleneck.

**2. Review_Documents** shows the highest SLA breach rate at 12.4%, driven by a 25-minute average processing time with 9 minutes of variability. This unpredictability disrupts downstream scheduling and suggests inconsistent case complexity or reviewer expertise gaps. **Recommendation:** Deploy tiered case routing: simpler cases to junior reviewers with tighter SLAs, complex cases to senior specialists with extended targets.

**3. Initial_Assessment** presents moderate but concerning metrics: an 18-minute wait time and 3.2% SLA breach rate. While not the worst in any single metric, its upstream position means its inefficiencies cascade through subsequent activities. **Recommendation:** Conduct a time-in-state analysis to identify whether the 18-minute queue stems from capacity constraints or case prioritization issues, and adjust staffing accordingly.
