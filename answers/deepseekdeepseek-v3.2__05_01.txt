Add a **non-interrupting timer boundary event** to **Task_Receive** with a 48-hour duration. Connect this timer directly to **Task_Triage** via a new sequence flow. This creates a bypass path that automatically escalates claims stuck in initial processing to triage within the SLA timeframe.

This ensures compliance without altering the core process logic. Claims completing normally proceed through Task_Check, while delayed claims automatically jump to Task_Triage when the timer expires, maintaining the 48-hour SLA.

**Element IDs**: Attach timer to `Task_Receive`, create new flow to `Task_Triage`.
