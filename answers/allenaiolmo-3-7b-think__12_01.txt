The fact is **not accurate**.  

**Justification**:  
- In **Case 1001**, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55, followed by "Authorize_REFUND" at 08:30:02 (Update precedes Authorize).  
- In **Case 1003**, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, followed by "Quality_Check" and later "Authorize_REFUND" at 10:22:18 (Update precedes Authorize).  

The fact claims "Authorize_REFUND" *always* occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory," but in both 1001 and 1003, the reverse sequence occurs. Since these cases are part of the event-log fragment, the fact does not hold universally. Cases without "Update_Inventory" (e.g., 1002) do not contradict the claim but also fail to support it, as the claim requires the sequence to exist *within the same case* where both activities occur. The counterexamples in 1001 and 1003 disprove the fact.
