Below is the answer based on Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process:

──────────────────────────────
a) Decision Points

1. Tri‐Color Risk Check Branch – After receiving the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) that determine a Low, Medium, or High risk rating, the process checks whether the risk is Low or Medium and the requested amount is at most €250,000; if both conditions hold, the application bypasses the Manual Underwriting Review, otherwise that review is required.

2. TriVote Approval Gate – At the “TriVote” step, the application must receive approvals from at least two out of the three designated roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) to pass the gate and proceed with the offer.
