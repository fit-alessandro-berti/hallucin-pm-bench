To compute the average cycle time of activity "Approve Invoice", we would typically need the start and complete times for this specific activity in the event log. However, the provided event log (Artefact A) has all row and timestamp values redacted for privacy, leaving only the column names. 

Given this limitation, we cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity as the necessary timestamp data is not available. The information provided in Artefact B, such as the average time from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice", does not directly relate to the cycle time of "Approve Invoice" itself and does not include the required timestamp details for calculation. Therefore, without access to the actual event log data, including start and complete times for "Approve Invoice", these metrics cannot be calculated.
