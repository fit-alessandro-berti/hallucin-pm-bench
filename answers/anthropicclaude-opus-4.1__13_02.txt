## 3. Why Low-Support Activities Can Mislead

Manual_Fraud_Check appears in only one case, making it statistically insignificant. With such limited occurrence, any performance metrics (like duration or success rate) calculated for this activity would be based on a single instance, making them unreliable. This single case cannot represent the true behavior of manual fraud checks across the organization. Generalizing from this would ignore variability in execution times, outcomes, and triggering conditions. Additionally, predictive models trained on this data might either completely miss the importance of manual checks or incorrectly estimate their impact on case outcomes.
