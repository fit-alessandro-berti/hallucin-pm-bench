Based solely on **Process B â€“ Warehouse_Replenishment**, the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently (within the same parallel split) are:

1. **Set 1** (after Parallel Split #1):  
   - `Quality_Check`  
   - `Update_Inventory`  

2. **Set 2** (after Parallel Split #2):  
   - `Generate_Replenishment_Report`  
   - `Notify_Procurement`  

### Explanation of concurrency in Process B:
- **Set 1** occurs after the first parallel split (`|| Parallel Split #1 ||`). The tasks `Quality_Check` and `Update_Inventory` run independently on separate branches until `|| Merge #1 ||`.
- **Set 2** occurs after the second parallel split (`|| Parallel Split #2 ||`). The tasks `Generate_Replenishment_Report` and `Notify_Procurement` run independently on separate branches until `|| Merge #2 ||`.  

No other tasks in Process B are executed concurrently.
