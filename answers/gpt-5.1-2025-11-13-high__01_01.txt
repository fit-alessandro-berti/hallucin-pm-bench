**Decision points in Contoso’s refund process**

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision:** Is the submitted refund claim eligible to proceed?  
   - **Basis for decision:**  
     - The passenger’s claim as captured in the **RefundRequestForm**.  
     - Cross-check against the **FlightManifest**.  
     - Conditions in the **WeatherReport**.  
   - **Effect:** If the eligibility check succeeds, the case can move on to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**; if it fails, the process cannot proceed further for that claim (no additional activities are defined).

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   - **Decision:** Should the refund be pre-approved by finance?  
   - **Basis for decision:**  
     - The controller verifies conditions using the **EligibilityChecklist** (applied to the already-validated claim).  
   - **Effect:** Only successfully pre-approved cases can move toward payment (and, for high-value claims, onward to **Senior_Auditor_Review**).

3. **High-value branch (amount > €1 000)**  
   - **Decision:** Is the refund amount greater than **€1 000**?  
   - **Basis for decision:**  
     - The refund amount associated with the claim (an attribute of the case; no extra artefact).  
   - **Effect:**  
     - If **> €1 000**: the case must go through **Senior_Auditor_Review**, which must include the **AuditTrail**, before payment can be processed.  
     - If **≤ €1 000**: **Senior_Auditor_Review** is skipped, and the case can move directly toward **Process_Refund_Payment** once pre-approved.

4. **Senior_Auditor_Review** (only for high-value claims)  
   - **Decision:** Should a high-value refund be approved after senior audit?  
   - **Basis for decision:**  
     - Review of the case including the **AuditTrail**.  
   - **Effect:** Only after **Senior_Auditor_Review** is completed can **Process_Refund_Payment** begin for high-value claims.

5. **Process_Refund_Payment – readiness to execute payment**  
   - **Decision:** Can the refund payment now be executed?  
   - **Preconditions / basis:**  
     - **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** has succeeded.  
     - For claims > €1 000, **Senior_Auditor_Review** has been completed.  
     - A signed **BankTransferAuthorization** is present.  
   - **Effect:** Once these conditions are met, the finance team executes the payment.

*(The final step, **Issue_Confirmation_Letter**, is a system action that sends confirmation; no decision point is described there.)*
