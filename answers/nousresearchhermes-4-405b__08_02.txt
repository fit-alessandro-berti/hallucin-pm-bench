**Answer 1.** No.

**Answer 2.** The order is enforced by token flow. P2 must be marked to enable either T3 or T5. The initial AND‑split via T1 marks P1 and P2. To mark P5 (needed for T5), P1 must enable T2, then T7, then T4. Critically, T7 fires into P4; T4 then fires from P4. T3’s consuming the token in P4 must therefore precede T4’s firing (and thus T5’s firing), because otherwise T4 cannot fire. Hence the sequence T2 → T7 → T3 is enforced before T5 can fire.
