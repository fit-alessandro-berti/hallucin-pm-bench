**EXECUTIVE MEMO**

**TO:** COO  
**FROM:** Senior Process Mining Analyst  
**RE:** Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks - Claims Process

**Critical Findings:**

**#1 Request_Documents** (worst performer)
- Average: 36.5h | 95th percentile: 120.0h
- **Action:** Implement automated document request system with SMS/email reminders every 24 hours

**#2 Send_Closure_Letter** 
- Average: 12.2h | 95th percentile: 44.0h  
- **Action:** Deploy automated letter generation triggered immediately upon claim resolution

**#3 Assess_Liability**
- Average: 7.8h | 95th percentile: 16.4h
- **Action:** Create dedicated liability assessment queue with SLA-based prioritization rules

These three activities account for the majority of our claims processing delays. The recommended automation initiatives should reduce waiting times by 25-40% within 90 days.

**Immediate escalation recommended.**
