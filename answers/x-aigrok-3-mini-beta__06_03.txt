Focusing on Process B â€“ Warehouse_Replenishment, the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently are identified based on the parallel constructs in the process. Below, I list each set, numbering them in the order they appear:

1. **Parallel Split #1**: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory  
   (These tasks can execute concurrently as they are on different branches of the first parallel split.)

2. **Parallel Split #2**: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement  
   (These tasks can execute concurrently as they are on different branches of the second parallel split.)
