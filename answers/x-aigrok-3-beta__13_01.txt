4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   - **Small Sample Size**: This fragment contains only 18 log lines across 4 cases, which is an extremely limited dataset. Such a small sample is unlikely to be representative of the overall population of events in a month, leading to potential bias or inaccurate frequency estimations for “Manual_Fraud_Check”.
   - **Temporal Bias**: The fragment covers events from a single day (2025-05-01). If manual fraud checks are more or less frequent on different days, weeks, or under varying conditions (e.g., holidays or specific business cycles), the estimate based on this single day will not reflect the true monthly frequency.
