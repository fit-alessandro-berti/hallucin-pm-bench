2️⃣ This excerpt contains only three distinct cases (1001–1003). Case 1002 triggered a “Manual Fraud Check,” whereas 1001 and 1003 used automatic variants. Inferring monthly frequency from this sample ignores the unknown volume of the full log. An analyst might assume manual checks occur in 33% of cases, but ignores sample bias: 1002 is the only case shown with a manual step. Without the case count for March, projecting this 1-in-3 ratio risks overestimation or underestimation of the true monthly volume. The snippet lacks data to represent the process flow accurately, as only one activity type matches the query out of three cases, and the remaining log volume is unknown.
