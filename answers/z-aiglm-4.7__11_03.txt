Analysis of our process data reveals that three activities are failing SLA targets due to excessive waiting times. Legal Approval is the most critical, averaging 900s throughput against a 600s target, with waiting time constituting 600s. Risk Review also severely underperforms, exceeding its 300s SLA by 300s while cases wait 480s. Additionally, Credit Assessment misses its 240s target by 60s, with a 200s average wait.

Immediate interventions are necessary:
*   Reduce the Legal Approval backlog by adding resources to address the 600s average waiting time.
*   Prioritize Risk Review resources to lower the 480s wait, bringing the 600s average closer to the 300s target.
*   Investigate the Credit Assessment queue to eliminate the 200s wait and meet the 240s SLA.
