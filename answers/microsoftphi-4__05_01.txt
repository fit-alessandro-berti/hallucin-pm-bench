To ensure compliance with the 48-hour SLA, introduce a Timer Event (Intermediate Catching) between the `Check Completeness` task (`Task_Check`, ID: Task_Check) and the `Docs complete?` gateway (`GW_Docs`, ID: GW_Docs). This timer should delay 48 hours, corresponding to the SLA period. Additionally, configure a boundary event on `Task_Check` that triggers if the timer expires, leading to an alternative flow. 

Modify `sequenceFlow` `f3` by adding an additional condition for escalation using a signal or message event to inform downstream processes of an escalation need if documents are not yet complete. This ensures claims that haven't reached `Task_Triage` within 48 hours are appropriately flagged for escalation, maintaining SLA without introducing new tasks. This implementation ensures that claims are triaged within the required timeframe or escalated if they are not, with existing activity paths still utilized.
