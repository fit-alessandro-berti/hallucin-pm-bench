**• Added tasks**
* **Verify Identity (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)**: A new task inserted at the beginning of the process, shifting the sequence flows so that it occurs between the Start Event and the "Review Application" task.
* **Request Additional Documents (`Task_RequestDocs`)**: A new task added as a routed outcome from the decision gateway, terminating at the End Event.
* **Final Reject (`Task_FinalReject`)**: A new task created to handle ineligible applications path, terminating at the End Event. *(Note: Because it possesses a completely new XML ID, it is a structural addition rather than a cosmetic rename.)*

**• Removed tasks**
* **Reject Loan (`Task_RejectLoan`)**: This task (and its sequence flow to the End Event) was structurally removed from the XML, effectively replaced by the newly created "Final Reject" task.

**• Gateway-type changes (e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)**
* **Gateway_Decision**: The element type was upgraded from an **Exclusive Gateway** (`<exclusiveGateway>`) to an **Inclusive Gateway** (`<inclusiveGateway>`). Additionally, its outgoing sequence flows were expanded and updated from two branches ("yes", "no") to three branches ("eligible", "missing docs", "ineligible") to accommodate the new tasks. 

*(Note: The name changes to `Task_ApproveLoan` ["Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan"] and `Gateway_Decision` ["Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check"] share identical ID tags between versions and have been omitted as cosmetic renamings per your instructions.)*
