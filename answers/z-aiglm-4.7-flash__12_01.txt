No, the fact is **inaccurate**.

**Justification:**
1.  **Case 1001:** The activity **Update_Inventory** occurs at 08:25:55, which is *before* **Authorize_Refund** at 08:30:02.
2.  **Case 1002:** The activity **Update_Inventory** is entirely missing from the log for this case, occurring neither immediately before nor after **Authorize_Refund**.
