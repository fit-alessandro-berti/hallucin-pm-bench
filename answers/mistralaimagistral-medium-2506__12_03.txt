**Answer:** No

**Justification:**
The FACT claims that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between. However, the event log provides counterexamples:

1. **CaseID C004**: Between "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T10:05:00) and "Validate_Payment" (2025-01-03T10:20:00), the activity "Check_Fraud" occurs at 2025-01-03T10:07:00. This violates the claim.

Additional observations (though not necessary to disprove the FACT):
- Cases C001, C002, and C003 do follow the sequence where "Validate_Payment" occurs directly after "Receive_Order" with no intervening activities (though CaseID C002 has "Pack_Items" before "Validate_Payment", which also violates the claim upon closer inspection).

But the key counterexample is C004, where "Check_Fraud" intervenes between the two activities. Thus, the FACT is incorrect.

**Revised Answer (after closer inspection of C002):**
Upon reviewing CaseID C002:
- "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T09:30:00) is followed by "Pack_Items" (2025-01-03T09:50:00) **prior** to "Validate_Payment" (2025-01-03T10:05:00).

**Therefore, two cases (C002 and C004) violate the FACT,** definitively proving it incorrect.

**Final Answer:** No
**Cases violating the FACT:** C002, C004.

(Note: C001 and C003 do conform to the FACT, but the presence of exceptions disproves it.)

\boxed{C002,C004} ‚Üê Cases that violate the FACT.
