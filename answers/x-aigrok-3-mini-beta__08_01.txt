Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in some reachable marking. Here's a concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:

### Firing Sequence:
1. Fire T1: Consumes 1 token from p0, adds 1 token to p1 and 1 token to p2.  
   New marking: [p0:0, p1:1, p2:1, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0]

2. Fire T2: Consumes 1 token from p1, adds 1 token to p3.  
   New marking: [p0:0, p1:0, p2:1, p3:1, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0]

3. Fire T5: Enabled because p3 has 1 token and p4 has 0 tokens (due to the inhibitor arc), so it consumes 1 token from p3 and adds 1 token to p6.  
   New marking: [p0:0, p1:0, p2:1, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:1]

At this point, T5 has fired, but T3 has not yet fired. T3 could fire next (consuming from p2 and adding to p4), but in this sequence, T5 occurs before T3.

### Brief Justification:
This sequence reaches a marking where T5 is enabled and fires before T3, as T3 requires a token in p2, which is still available but not used until after T5. The inhibitor arc on T5 ensures it can fire only when p4 is empty, which is the case here before T3 executes.
