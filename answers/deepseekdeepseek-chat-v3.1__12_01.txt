Based solely on the provided event-log fragment, the fact is **not accurate**.

**Justification:**
The log shows three cases (1001, 1002, 1003). In two of them (1001, 1003), "Update_Inventory" occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund". In one case (1002), "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all, so the claimed relationship does not apply. There is no case in this log where "Authorize_Refund" occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory".
