The claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order* is inaccurate. In case C002 (lines 3–5), *Receive_Order* (line 3) is followed by *Check_Inventory* (line 4) before *Validate_Payment* (line 5), violating the immediate sequence. Additionally, in case C003 (lines 6–7), *Validate_Payment* (line 6) occurs before *Receive_Order* (line 7), directly contradicting the claim. These deviations (C002 and C003) prove that *Validate_Payment* does not consistently follow *Receive_Order*.
