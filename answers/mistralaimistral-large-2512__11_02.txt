**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Top 3 Bottlenecks & Actions

1. **Review Documents**
   - *Why:* Highest SLA breaches (12.4%) and rework (5.3%), coupled with long processing (25 min) and high variability (9 min). Wait time (30 min) compounds delays.
   - *Action:* Pilot AI-assisted document validation to reduce manual review time and rework.

2. **Request Documents**
   - *Why:* Lowest throughput (190 cases/day) and extreme wait time (150 min), driving 22% rework and 5.5% SLA breaches.
   - *Action:* Implement automated customer reminders (e.g., SMS/email) to cut document submission delays.

3. **Initial Assessment**
   - *Why:* Second-highest SLA breaches (3.2%) and rework (1.8%), with moderate wait (18 min) and processing (12 min) times.
   - *Action:* Standardize assessment criteria via a decision-tree tool to reduce variability and rework.

*Note:* "Check Coverage" and "Calculate Payout" show minor inefficiencies but are not top-tier concerns based on the data.
