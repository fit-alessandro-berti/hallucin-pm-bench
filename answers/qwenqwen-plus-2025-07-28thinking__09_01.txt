The requested value cannot be derived.

**Explanation:**  
The event log provided intentionally has "timestamps & elapsed-time fields redacted" as stated in the context. Without timestamps or duration data, it is impossible to calculate the cycle time for any activity—including "Review Contract"—as cycle time requires start and end times to compute durations.  

The historical benchmark data provided is explicitly noted to be from **FY-2023** and a **different customer segment**, so it cannot be applied to this log. Additionally, the benchmark does not include a value for "Review Contract" in any case.  

While the log shows that "Review Contract" occurred in 4 cases (C-001, C-002, C-003, C-004), no temporal information is available to determine how long each instance took. Cycle time calculations require time-based event data, which is entirely absent here.
