Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

Consider the following firing sequence starting from the initial marking:

**Initial marking**:  
p0 = 1, p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0, p4 = 0, p5 = 0, p6 = 0

1. Fire **T1** (enabled because p0 has 1 token):  
   → consumes 1 from p0, produces 1 in p1 and 1 in p2  
   New marking: p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, others 0

Now, **T2** and **T3** are both enabled (p1 and p2 each have a token), but we are asking if T5 can fire before T3.

Currently, p3 has no token, so T5 is **not yet enabled**.

So, next:

2. Fire **T2** (p1 → p3):  
   → consumes 1 from p1, produces 1 in p3  
   New marking: p1=0, p3=1, p2=1, others 0

Now:
- p3 has 1 token
- p4 has 0 tokens ⇒ so **inhibitor condition for T5 is satisfied**

Thus, **T5 is enabled**.

Note that **T3 has not fired yet** (p2 still has 1 token, p4 still has 0).

So now we fire:

3. Fire **T5** (p3 → p6, enabled because p4 = 0):  
   → consumes 1 from p3, produces 1 in p6  
   New marking: p3=0, p6=1, p2=1, others 0

At this point, **T5 has fired**, and **T3 has not**.

✅ Therefore, **yes**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Firing sequence**: T1 → T2 → T5  
**Justification**: After T1 and T2, p3 has a token and p4 is empty, satisfying T5’s normal and inhibitor arc conditions. T3 remains unfired but was available; however, the net allows choosing to fire T5 first.
