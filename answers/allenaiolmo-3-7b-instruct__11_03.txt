Subject: Process Performance Analysis – Top Issues and Recommended Actions

Dear COO,

Our process analysis identifies three activities that most significantly miss SLA targets and exhibit elevated waiting times: Credit Assessment (exceeding its 240s target by 60s, waiting time 200s), Legal Approval (SLA breach of 300s, waiting time 600s), and Receive Application (SLA breach of 60s, waiting time 10s, though relatively low compared to others but still non-compliant).

Recommendations:  
• For Credit Assessment, implement parallel assessment workflows to reduce processing time and waiting.  
• For Legal Approval, introduce automated status alerts to streamline review cycles and cut delays.  
• For Receive Application, establish a pre-verification queue to quickly triage eligibility and minimize initial wait times.

These targeted actions are grounded in current performance data and aim to directly address both SLA non-compliance and high customer waiting times.
