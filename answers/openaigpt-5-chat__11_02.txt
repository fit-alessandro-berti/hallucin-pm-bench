**Executive Memo – Q1 2025 Claims Handling Performance**  

COO,  

Analysis of the Q1 dashboard highlights **three clear performance bottlenecks**:  

1. **Request_Documents**  
   - *Issues*: Very low throughput (190/day), extreme queueing (150 min wait), high rework rate (22%), and the highest SLA breaches among early steps (5.5%). Long waits and repeat requests indicate upstream information gaps.  
   - *Action*: Introduce a standardized, automated document checklist at claim registration to reduce missing‑document loops and cut rework.  

2. **Review_Documents**  
   - *Issues*: Significant wait (30 min) plus long, variable processing (25 min avg; ±9 min). Elevated rework (5.3%) and SLA breaches (12.4%) suggest complexity and inconsistency in review criteria.  
   - *Action*: Implement targeted reviewer training and decision‑support tools to reduce variability and standardize review.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - *Issues*: Long wait (18 min), moderate processing (12 min) but higher variability (±4 min) than most peers, with 3.2% SLA breach rate—second only to the above bottlenecks.  
   - *Action*: Streamline triage rules and ensure balanced workload allocation to minimize queue build‑up and delay.  

Addressing these three steps should significantly improve end‑to‑end claim cycle time and SLA adherence.
