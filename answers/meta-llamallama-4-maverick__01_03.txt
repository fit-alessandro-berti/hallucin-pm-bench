## Step 1: Identify the decision points in Acme's SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process.
The decision points are the steps where a decision is made that affects the flow of the process. From the given process description, the decision points are: (1) the conditional branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check (step 4), and (2) Decision-Gate "TriVote" (step 6).

## Step 2: Describe the rule for each decision point in one sentence.
For step 4, the rule is: The process skips Manual-Underwriting-Review if the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is less than or equal to €250,000. For step 6, the rule is: The loan is approved if any two out of the three required approvals (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) are obtained.

## Step 3: List all the documents required in the process in the order they first appear.
The documents are: (1) **Form 14B** (step 1), (2) **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** (step 3), (3) **Deck Memo** (step 5), (4) **Offer Sheet 77** (step 7), (5) **ID Matrix Declaration** (step 8), and (6) **Loan Dossier 2025** (step 9).

## Step 4: Address part a) of the user's question by summarizing the decision points.
The decision points are: (1) the conditional branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check, which skips Manual-Underwriting-Review if the risk is Low or Medium and the requested amount is ≤ €250,000, and (2) Decision-Gate "TriVote", which approves the loan if any two out of three required approvals are obtained.

## Step 5: Address part b) of the user's question by listing the required documents in order.
The documents required, in order of their first appearance, are: **Form 14B**, **Scorecard–Cyan**, **Scorecard–Magenta**, **Scorecard–Yellow**, **Deck Memo**, **Offer Sheet 77**, **ID Matrix Declaration**, and **Loan Dossier 2025**.

The final answer is: 
For part a): 
1. The process skips Manual-Underwriting-Review if (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ €250,000).
2. The loan is approved at "TriVote" if any two out of three approvals are obtained.

For part b): 
1. **Form 14B**
2. **Scorecard–Cyan**
3. **Scorecard–Magenta**
4. **Scorecard–Yellow**
5. **Deck Memo**
6. **Offer Sheet 77**
7. **ID Matrix Declaration**
8. **Loan Dossier 2025**
