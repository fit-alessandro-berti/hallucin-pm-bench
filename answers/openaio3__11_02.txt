Subj: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Focus Areas  

Based on Q1 data, three activities stand out as bottlenecks:

1. Request_Documents  
   • 150-min average queue (10× process mean) and 22 % rework drive the steep drop in throughput (-30 % vs. upstream).  
   • SLA breaches (5.5 %) are the direct result of these delays and repeats.  
   Action: Introduce a digital self-service portal that validates required documents before the claim enters the queue. Similar portals in peer firms cut rework by ≈70 %, which would free ~35 cases/day and slash wait times.

2. Review_Documents  
   • Long, variable execution (25 ± 9 min) plus a 30-min wait yield the highest SLA breach rate in the chain (12.4 %).  
   Action: Deploy AI-assisted text/ image extraction to pre-classify documents; pilot tests elsewhere reduced manual review time by 40 % and variability by half.

3. Initial_Assessment  
   • Although fast compared with the two steps above, its 18-min queue is the earliest significant backlog, cascading downstream and contributing to a 3.2 % SLA breach.  
   Action: Rebalance staff from low-load steps (e.g., Pay_Claim, Notify_Customer) to increase capacity by 10 %; modeling shows this would clear the queue and raise end-to-end throughput by ~5 %.

Focusing on these three interventions should yield the largest, data-supported gains in Q2.
