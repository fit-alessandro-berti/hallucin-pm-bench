Yes

Justification:
1. Quality_Engineer_Review and Regulatory_Affairs_Review occur once each and in the correct order.
2. VP_Safety_Approval happens after both QE and RA due to the severity being "High".
3. Notify_Authorities occurs after QE and RA are complete.
4. Close_Case occurs after NA and VP_Safety_Approval (as required by rule 2).
