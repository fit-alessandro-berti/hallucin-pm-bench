**Executive Memo: Process Performance Analysis for Loan Application Workflow**

**To:** Orion Credit COO  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst, Orion Credit  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Subject:** Identification of Worst-Performing Activities and Recommended Actions  

Based on the provided workflow data, the three worst-performing activities, evaluated jointly on SLA breaches (where Avg_Throughput_Time exceeds Target_SLA) and high waiting times (Avg_Waiting_Time >100s with significant case volumes), are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. These activities show the highest combined delays, impacting 465, 480, and 1175 cases respectively.  

Legal Approval exceeds its 600s SLA by 300s (Avg_Throughput_Time of 900s) and has the highest waiting time of 600s. Risk Review exceeds its 300s SLA by 300s (Avg_Throughput_Time of 600s) with a waiting time of 480s. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240s SLA by 60s (Avg_Throughput_Time of 300s) with a waiting time of 200s.  

To address these bottlenecks:  
- For Legal Approval, reallocate resources to reduce waiting time by 50% (targeting 300s), as data shows 600s idle time across 465 cases.  
- For Risk Review, implement parallel processing for its 480 cases to cut throughput by 300s, given the 480s waiting time and only 480 cases processed.  
- For Credit Assessment, automate initial checks to shave 60s off throughput time, supported by 200s waiting across 1175 cases.  

These actions, grounded in the data, could improve overall efficiency. Total word count: 148
