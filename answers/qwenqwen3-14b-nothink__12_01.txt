No, the fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification:**  
In **Case 1001**, "Authorize_Refund" occurs **after** "Update_Inventory". The sequence is:  
**Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued**.

This directly contradicts the claim that "Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory" within the same case.
