It is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" from the information provided. The event log contains only the column names, with all rows and timestamps redacted. Since no actual timestamp data (start_time or complete_time) are available, the duration of any activity instance cannot be calculated. Without these durations, no time-based metrics—including cycle time statistics—can be derived. Therefore, all requested computations are infeasible given the absence of observable event times.
