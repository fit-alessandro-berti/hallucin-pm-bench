MEMO

The three weakest activities, based on Q1-2025 metrics, are:

1) Request_Documents  
   • Under-performs due to the highest average wait time (150 minutes) and a 22% rework rate, which together drive SLA breaches (5.5%).  
   • Action: Introduce a revised document checklist and automate requests to cut wait times and reduce rework.

2) Review_Documents  
   • High processing time (25 minutes) and large variability (stdev 9) contribute to a 12.4% SLA breach rate.  
   • Action: Standardize review criteria and implement targeted training to lower execution time and variability.

3) Initial_Assessment  
   • Though throughput is relatively good, its 18-minute wait time and 3.2% SLA breach indicate delayed starts and moderate rework (1.8%).  
   • Action: Realign staffing or scheduling to reduce queue buildup and maintain consistent assessment speed.

All other activities show comparatively lower wait times, processing durations, and SLA breaches. These findings suggest focusing resources and process improvements where bottlenecks (long queues, high variation) and rework remain most pronounced.
