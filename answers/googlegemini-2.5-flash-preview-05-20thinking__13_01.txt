Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided event-log fragment:

1.  The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.
2.  This represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1 / 18 * 100 = 5.555..., rounded to 5.56%).
3.  The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.
4.  Two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable are:
    *   **Limited Timeframe:** The data covers only a single day (2025-05-01), which is not representative for estimating a *monthly* frequency. Fraud checks might have daily, weekly, or seasonal variations not captured in such a short period.
    *   **Small Sample Size:** The fragment contains only 18 events from 4 cases, which is a very small sample to generalize about the overall frequency of an event across a larger population of cases or a longer period. It does not account for the typical volume or patterns of operations.
