We are Phi. I see a conversational query. There is a set of processes from an informal description and need to create a RACI table that covers every task, using only the mandated terms for specific roles: "Transaction Analyst" [not "payment clerk", which is not allowed as mandated term but note: Allowed terms in mandated vocabulary with instructions: "Use 'Transaction Analyst' --never “Payment Clerk”, “Processor”, or “Agent”".

But note: "Transaction Analyst" is used - "KYC Review" is mandated instead of "Customer Due Diligence" check.
Wait exactly:
"For activities and roles, use using only mandated terms: 
-- KYC Review (not aka "Customer Due Diligence" but must be called "KYC Review" because the text says: Use "KYC Review" -- never "Customer Due Diligence" or "CDD"(?) 
-- Regulatory Liaison is mandated instead of "Compliance Officer".
-- Transaction Analyst instead of "Payment Clerk" (or "Processor, agent", etc.)

So let's re-read the vocabulary mandate:
"Vocabulary mandate – follow strictly in every output:
• Use "KYC Review" — never "Customer Due Diligence", "CDD", or similar.
• Use "Regulatory Liaison" — never "Compliance Officer".
• Use "Transaction Analyst" — never "Payment Clerk", "Processor", or "Agent".

So in output text, whenever they mention "Customer Due Diligence", use "KYC Review". Also, "Compliance Officer" should be replaced with "Regulatory Liaison".

Now "Payment Clerk" in the informal description should be replaced with "Transaction Analyst" because mandated terms require use "Transaction Analyst".

Let's re-read the process text and note tasks we have:
Informal description:

1. "A payment clerk receives the customer’s transfer instruction and logs it in the system." -> Instead, call them "Transaction Analyst" because in mandated vocabulary, we must not use payment clerk. So we must update the text.

2. "The clerk screens the payment against the sanctions list." -> So these tasks are performed by Transaction Analyst? Not sure, potentially the same role.

3. "A compliance officer performs the customer due diligence check on both sender and beneficiary." -> Instead we say "Regulatory Liaison performs the KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary."

4. "If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, the compliance officer must approve it." -> that means "Regulatory Liaison approves the transaction on high risk."

5. "Once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent." -> So what roles? The payment release is done by the Transaction Analyst. The sending of SWIFT message is done by IT Support?

6. "Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified." -> So IT Support archives case file. And instead of notifying compliance officer, we must say "Regulatory Liaison is notified" as mandated mapping.

Now need to produce a RACI table that covers every task, using only the mandated terms required.

We must produce in markdown format table.

We must produce a RACI table covering every task. So likely need to produce headings: "Tasks" and then columns "Responsible", "Accountable", "Consulted", "Informed". And list tasks then assign to each stakeholder among permitted names.

The tasks are:
Task: "Receive customer transfer instruction and log it in system"
Task: "Screen payment against sanctions list"
Task: "Perform KYC Review [customer due diligence check] on sender and beneficiary". However mandated term "KYC Review" is the mandated usage for what "customer due diligence" means. 
Task: "Approve high-risk transaction via mandated process"
Task: "Release the payment (once approved) and ensure SWIFT message is sent (by IT>S)". Actually tasks might be: "release payment" perhaps handled by Transaction Analyst, and "ensure the SWIFT message is sent" is done by IT Support.
Task: "Archive the case file"

Wait, check exactly detail: Step 1 is: Payment clerk receives the customer’s transfer instruction and logs it in the system. Step 2: The clerk screens the payment against the sanctions list. Step 3: KYC Review is performed by Regulatory Liaison on both sender and beneficiary. Step 4: If flagged high risk, then Regulatory Liaison must approve it. Step 5: Once approved, Transaction Analyst (replacing clerk) releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent.
Step 6: IT Support archives the case file and Regulatory Liaison is informed by IT Support.

We have roles: Transaction Analyst (for step 1 execution, 2, and payment release in step 5) ; Regulatory Liaison (for steps 3 and 4 & notification in step 6) ; IT Support. So what are the roles in our RACI table? We need to present a RACI table with these roles as column headings? Possibly list tasks with Role columns: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support. 
But then the tasks might require assign who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed, but we must name them using the mandated terms. But the question says "create a RACI table that covers every task, using only the mandated terms above for activities and roles."

I must check if tasks are inter-role subjects. Possibly the RACI table should include tasks and then assign columns for each department (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support)

I do not see any consultation with regulatory bodies. But mandated terms don't allow customer due diligence etc. But they have "Regulatory Liaison" as a designated role, which is mandated roles.

I look up the mandated vocabulary: It says "Use KYC Review" so step 3 becomes "regulatory liaison performs the KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary". Also, must use "Transaction Analyst" in place of Payment Clerk.

So tasks become:
1. Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system. Who is responsible?
2. Screen the payment against the sanctions list.
3. Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary.
4. Approve high risk transactions.
5. Release the payment; ensure SWIFT message is sent. Actually what the role should be, perhaps distribution between Transaction Analyst and IT Support.
6. Archive the case file and notify Regulatory Liaison.

But must be a RACI table which includes tasks and roles for each role.

We can list the tasks as separate rows and assign R A C I for each role: maybe we have these roles as columns: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support. But instructions say "covers every task" means tasks are rows, and then columns: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed. But sometimes RACI matrix is grouped by roles as columns instead of tasks as rows. However instructions: "create a RACI table" typically have columns with roles on top, then tasks in rows and then assign cells for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed.

We can consider generic roles might include "Transaction Analyst" and "Regulatory Liaison" and "IT Support". But may also require including "KYC Review" as a specific activity that must be assigned.

Wait: Let's check instructions. The informal process is given as a list of tasks. The text is "cross-border payment service" and we have required vocabulary. The mandated roles: "Transaction Analyst" instead of Payment Clerk, "Regulatory Liaison" instead of Compliance Officer. KYC Review is mandated instead of Customer Due Diligence. But what are actual tasks enumerated? They are:

Task 1: "Receive and log the customer’s transfer instruction." Task 2: "Screen payment against sanctions." Task 3: "KYC Review on sender and beneficiary." Task 4: "Approve flagged high-risk transaction if needed." Task 5: "Release the payment; IT support ensures SWIFT message." Task 6: "Archive case file; notify Regulatory Liaison."

I need to decide who is Responsible vs Accountable for each task. Let's try to map: 
Task 1:
- Who is capturing input? The mandated role for Payment Clerk is now replaced by Transaction Analyst. So probably "Transaction Analyst" is Responsible for monitoring and logging the instruction. Possibly also "Regulatory Liaison" might be Accountable to ensure that the proper policies are being adhered? But "Accountable" is usually the one with final authority oversight. Let's check: Who does the main steps though? Starting with Customer instructions: They are "Transaction Analyst". 
Accountable means the party that is answerable. Possibly "Regulatory Liaison" is in overall oversight of compliance tasks including KYC Review. But how to assign? Let's try to assign:

Task 1: "Receive and log customer transfer instruction"
- It requires that the transfer instructions are received and logged. The mandated actor for logging is Transaction Analyst perhaps? But normally, from the text: "a payment clerk receives instruction and logs it" but that role is now represented with Transaction Analyst. So "Transaction Analyst" is Responsible for that task. But what's with Accountable? Possibly Regulatory Liaison: No, that doesn't seem to be oversight for logging internal instructions. But in a typical RACI matrix, Accountable is normally a higher role. Who is Accountable for this process? Possibly the Regulatory Liaison overall? But let's check next tasks:

Task 2: "Screen the payment against the sanctions list." RACI: Who should do it? It's part of receiving instruction. Possibly assigned to Transaction Analyst. However, the decision rule "Ask, assign Accountable" defines: if a step is delegated to someone else. In cross-border payments, Screen transaction is a necessary step, so Transaction Analyst has execution responsibility and must consult Regulatory Liaison if it's flagged high risk. But the number 5 said once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent. 

Let's re-read the process description:
a. Step 1: Receive and log transfer instructions. 
b. Step 2: Screen against sanctions. 
These are basically done by the Transaction Analyst.
c. Step 3: KYC Review performed by Regulatory Liaison.
d. Step 4: If transaction flagged high-risk, Regulatory Liaison must approve it. 
This might be inserted as additional risk escalation task which Regulatory Liaison is responsible.
e. Step 5: Once approved, clerk (Transaction Analyst) releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent.
f. Step 6: IT Support archives case file; Regulatory Liaison is notified.

However, one potential point: Regulatory Liaison's notification in step 6 probably not responsible for making sure file is archived? But instructions says: "archiving" is done by IT Support but Regulatory Liaison is Informed. So IT Support is Responsible for archiving, not Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison. Check if archiving is mentioned: "archiving the case file" is explicitly mentioned in step 6 "Finally, IT Support archives the case file."
So far we have three integrated roles: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support.

However, if we check the mandated vocabulary, we are only allowed three roles or maybe it is just pairwise mapping using mandated roles? But mandated roles doesn't include "IT Support" because that's not replaced by anything. But then the IT Support in the tasks is not mandated term. Is that allowed? But instructions says "using only the mandated terms above" also for roles. But what about IT Support? Is it a permitted role? The allowed vocabulary? It says "roles: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison are mandated. But instructions can also allow IT Support as that is not mentioned in the vocabulary mandate specifically. But it might be allowed because we are directly using the informal process description steps. The mandated vocabulary given are only for Payment Clerk, Compliance Officer, Customer due diligence. But what about IT Support? There's no replacement needed because instructions from mandated vocabulary don't list IT Support because it's not something to replace with our mandated terms? The directive says "provided that *only* the mandated terms are used for activities and roles" But careful reading: "using *only* the mandated terms above for activities and roles" Means that when we use a role in our documentation related to those functions, we must use the specific terms: KYC Review for testing, Regulatory Liaison for CDD compliance, Transaction Analyst for payment processing. However, the terms already used in the description "IT Support" is not explicitly mandated to be replaced with any term. So maybe we can leave "IT Support" as is.

Now check the roles columns: maybe we have columns for roles not calculated by verbosity: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support.

I must produce a table in Markdown using headings and rows that lists each task and gives the RACI info. Let me produce a Markdown table with columns: Task, Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed. But a typical RACI matrix is set out with roles as columns along the top and the rows being tasks, then in each cell an X for assigned R, A, C, I. But sometimes the instructions require reorganization.

Because the mandated vocabulary for "Transaction Clerk" is now "Transaction Analyst", so it might be assigned that as the name for digital money roles. Then further tasks, we want the matrix to include each task then columns with the roles: "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", and "IT Support". But then tasks may be allocated R, A, C, I. But sometimes it's better to produce a RACI matrix with tasks as rows, and then columns for each mandatory role. I should produce a table in markdown that is a proper RACI table:

I may have "Tasks" and then "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "IT Support" as columns and then rows for each of the tasks. I'll assign responsibilities as follows:

Let's define tasks as, per steps:

Task 1: Receive and log customer's transfer instruction.
Possible assignments:
   Responsible: Transaction Analyst does the receiving and logging.
   Who is Accountable? Possibly the same Transaction Analyst might be both, but does it require any oversight? Possibly Regulatory Liaison because they must ensure valid KYC? But then the information is provided in step no. But wait, typically Accountability is with either the manager. However, workflow suggests that initial input goes to Transaction Analyst. But may not be directly: Transaction Analyst has responsibility, but who is answerable to? That's usually something like the manager of cross-border payments might not be included. But we only have three roles. But maybe we assume Regulatory Liaison is overall compliance and oversight and IT Support is technical. So between the two, Regulatory Liaison is more likely to be Accountable for the KYC/transaction workflow because he is in charge of compliance.

But perhaps not. Alternatively, consider: Transaction Analyst is the doer that executes multiple tasks. Regulatory Liaison is the gatekeeper. But then when it's risk screening or KYC checks, Regulatory Liaison does that so maybe they are Responsible for those tasks, not Transaction Analyst.

Let me think: Usually the typology for Payment processing workflow in banks: The data entry clerk is responsible for input tasks, the compliance officer (here Regulatory Liaison) is responsible for KYC and risk screening. The technical support team ensures SWIFT messages and archiving. But we want RACI matrix:
- Identify clear roles for each step. Review work flow:

Step 1: The Transaction Analyst receives and logs instructions in the system. They are Responsible because they are the primary point. The Accountable may be them as well or might be Regulatory Liaison? But regulations usually require Regulatory Liaison oversight. But in risk processes, it is usual that the releasing party (Before releasing the payments, they need approval by Regulatory Liaison if flagged high risk). Therefore, if no risk is flagged, maybe Regulatory Liaison is not involved in approval? But might be consulted at the risk screening stage.

Let’s assign tasks with care:

Task 1: Receive and log customer transfer instructions.
Who is directly performing that? That would be Transaction Analyst (RA or R role) and may consult IT Support sometimes because IT Support might have logistic technical support. But typical scenario: The initial task of accepting a customer instruction is controlled by Transaction Analyst. But possibly the identity screening functionalities? But maybe Regulatory Liaison should also be consulted because KYC Review is required to be done right away? But check tasks: In Step 3, Regulatory Liaison performs KYC Review. So that is a separate task. Therefore, Task 1: "Receive and log instruction" is done solely by Transaction Analyst. There's no consultation required from Regulatory Liaison? But step 3 is: "Regulatory Liaison performs the KYC Review". So that suggests that after receiving instructions, the Transaction Analyst might forward to the Regulatory Liaison. But then the actual Task 1 should not include dependencies for Regulatory Liaison. So I'll assign:

Task 1: 
Responsible: Transaction Analyst.
Accountable: Transaction Analyst (because they are the ones who ensure the instructions are logged properly; maybe answerable to managers but no explicit designation?). But perhaps Regulatory Liaison would be informed about customer instructions? Well, not really, because only after logging is when check begins.
Consulted: Possibly Regulatory Liaison (because the subject of KYC review might come later)
Informed: IT Support? Possibly not.
Not sure.

I think the typical RACI for initial data entry: 
- Responsible: Transaction Analyst (usually doer), potentially Associate (maybe Accountable also to Regulatory Liaison? But no, that would conflict with tasks that are mandated to be done by Regulatory Liaison later.)
For the receiving and logging instructions: 
Assignment:
R (Responsible): Transaction Analyst.
A (Accountable): Transaction Analyst. But who should have oversight? In typical process design, the one who is executing the procedure is Responsible, however the one who has final oversight (accountable) is normally a manager or supervisor. But we only have the designated roles for process steps.
Maybe I need to read second instructions: "using only the mandated terms above for activities and roles." Therefore we might list that actions "KYC Review" and "Regulatory Liaison" must be the only terms used for compliance checks. So maybe the RACI matrix tasks:
I can create groups: 
- Data capture and sanction screening by Transaction Analyst. Submission to KYC Review by Regulatory Liaison.
- KYC Review: Regulatory Liaison is Responsible (perform the check) and also Accountable perhaps, including if flagged. 
- Release Payment: Task may be executed by Transaction Analyst with IT Support 'Action' to ensure SWIFT message is sent.
- Archiving of file is executed by IT Support, Regulatory Liaison is informed.

It is tricky to assign exactly the RACI for each step if not documented in the text. Let me attempt then to assign based on a standard separation of duties:
Tasks:
1. Receive and log transfer instructions.
   - Responsible (R): Transaction Analyst
   - Accountable (A): Transaction Analyst (since they are directly responsible for initial processing)
   - Consulted (C): Regulatory Liaison? They may not be consulted though because it's a front desk operation. Possibly I might not include any Consulted in this step.
   - Informed (I): IT Support maybe? However, there's no notification requirement.

Alternatively, start by forming a table with tasks subject rows and columns for roles names "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "IT Support". But we have additional category for "KYC Review" which is an activity not corresponding to a role. But the instruction might be: "using only mandated terms when referring to roles or activities." meaning that when we reference high risk approval; we must refer to it as "Regulatory Liaison." So if an activity in the original text said "customer due diligence check", then we replace it with "KYC Review." So we incorporate as row header "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary."

I will produce a table with tasks as rows, and columns for "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "IT Support." Then assign R, A, C, or I accordingly. 

Tasks (based on process steps):
1. Receive & Log instructions.
2. Screen payment against sanctions list.
3. Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary.
4. Approve flagged high-risk transaction (if flagged high risk).
5. Release payment and ensure SWIFT message is sent.
6. Archive case file and notify.

I must produce a RACI table. However, note the original process tasks are not explicitly named as tasks. But we want a table that covers every task. To be thorough, I'll outline tasks and assign roles:

For "Receive and logcustomer transfer instruction": 
- Responsible: Transaction Analyst
- Accountable: Transaction Analyst (because they log the transfer and then proceed with needed steps)
- Consulted: Regulatory Liaison? Not sure. I doubt regulatory liaison consults on transaction data entry. Let's check the next tasks conditions: The Screening of transaction is usually done by the same person that logs the transaction. So maybe Regulatory Liaison consults for suspicious cases? But nobody is explicitly consulting at this stage. Perhaps we leave Consulted blank and Informed blank. 
I can leave them as: 
   - Transaction Analyst: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted: not applicable maybe?
   - Regulatory Liaison: Informed is not required? I worry that in RACI you sometimes fill blank if not involved in a particular stage.
But in RACI usually every task gets an assignment for some role, but it's OK if a cell remains blank or N/A.

However, the instructions likely intend a complete table where tasks get a designated classification for each of the roles from: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support. 
I can create columns for these to show which are Responsible, etc.

Let's decide: 
- Task 1: Receive & Log Instruction.
   Likely only Transaction Analyst is responsible for logging and then they forward the transaction to Screening: so we assign:
   Role Responsibilities:
      Transaction Analyst: Responsible, Accountable possibly.
      Regulatory Liaison: Not involved? Possibly Consulted if troubleshooting?
      IT Support: Possibly Not involved, so I might say No assignment. I can put an X under "Not Involved".

Wait but RACI table design is normally to have "R", "A", "C", or "I" under each task for each role. But we have columns for roles: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support.
But, strictly, we must use mandated terms.
Let's assign: 
For Task 1 "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" I'll assume: 
- "Transaction Analyst" is Responsible (R) for the implementation of the data collection. 
- And also "Transaction Analyst" should be accountable (A), because they own the process step. It's typical that if no one else is designated, the person executing is responsible and also accountable.

Task 2: "Screen payment against sanctions list."
- Likely also done by Transaction Analyst. So:
   - Transaction Analyst: Responsible (R), possibly Accountable? But then which one is actually verifying? Typically the screening might be a mandate that's done as a form of risk assessment, but is not explicitly the domain of Regulatory Liaison? 
   - Perhaps it is best to say that both Transaction Analyst is Responsible and Regulatory Liaison should be Consulted (if suspicious) because they have the expertise on sanctions compliance. But the informal text says "The clerk screens the payment", i.e., performed by the Transaction Analyst. But then the Compliance Officer (Regulatory Liaison) only performs the KYC review. So risk screening is not performed by Regulatory Liaison. 
   - So for Task 2, "Screening against sanctions list" is expected to be executed by Transaction Analyst, but if there's an issue, then compliance is involved possibly later if issues arise.
   - So I assign:
      * Transaction Analyst: Responsible (R)
      * Transaction Analyst: Possibly Accountable (A) as well. But then Regulatory Liaison: Informed maybe because they might need to know about any potential issues. But does step 2 ask to consult Regulatory Liaison? Not in this step. But in check stage, perhaps Regulatory Liaison is notified if the action is unclear.
   - Alternatively, if we want to maintain separation of duty, we might say:
       Transaction Analyst: Responsible, and Regulatory Liaison: Consulted.
   - Let's assign: 
         Responsible: Transaction Analyst. 
         Accountable: Transaction Analyst.
         Consulted: Regulatory Liaison (if there is any doubt or support needed in screening; but then that might not be real because screening against a sanctions list is a well-defined process result in automated screening. But the task explicitly said "the clerk screens", meaning review, check, process the screening result. Reg. Liaison is not doing that. They only do KYC Review. So maybe we do not include Regulatory Liaison here.)
         I'll decide: 
         For Task 2, I'll assign:
         Transaction Analyst: Responsible, Accountable, No Consulted, Informed: Not involved.

Task 3: "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary".
- This activity is mandated replacement for "Customer Due Diligence", so must be referenced as "KYC Review." 
- Which role performs this activity? The "Compliance Officer" (mandated term: Regulatory Liaison) performs it. So assign: Regulatory Liaison is both Responsible and Accountable for this task. 
- That is typical for a KYC Check.

Task 4: "Approve high-risk transaction if flagged."
- This is a subset of the KYC Review process perhaps. But the text "If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, the compliance officer must approve it" means Regulatory Liaison must approve. So I assign:
  - Responsible: Regulatory Liaison is responsible for the actual approval.
  - Accountable: Regulatory Liaison remains accountable. 
  - Possibly consult the Regulatory Liaison? Possibly no consult.
  There is no mention of any other role in approving high risk. So maybe Transaction Analyst are not involved. But interesting twist is that the KYC Review in Task 3 is a review but here it says "if flagged high risk, the compliance officer must approve it." This is an additional decision that might be delegated to Regulatory Liaison. Possibly, Regulatory Liaison is also Consulted? But I think it's best to leave it: 
  For Task 4: 
  Regulatory Liaison is Responsible and Accountable, no consulted or informed. 
  In practice, depending on your RACI design, the same person might be involved.
  
Task 5: "Once approved, release payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent."
- This task decomposes two tasks: Payment Release, and Transmission of SWIFT message.
- "Release payment" usually is done by the Transaction Analyst because they initiated transaction instructions. And then "ensuring SWIFT message is sent" is done by IT Support. But how do we assign RACI for a composite task? Possibly we'll call this task "Payment Release and SWIFT Transmission".
- For assigning, I think we separate like this: 
   - Transaction Analyst: Responsible for releasing payment (the transaction is released). Also, maybe Accountable for that step, because they check that the transaction already has approval. But the system: 
   Actually text: "Once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent."
   So maybe breakdown:
      a) Releasing a payment is done by Transaction Analyst.
      b) Ensuring SWIFT message is sent is done by IT Support.
- Since it's a composite task, one option is to create two rows: one for Payment Release, one for SWIFT message transmission. But instructions says "covers every task" does that mean each subtask? Possibly yes.
- But usually, tasks should not be too granular. But I think it's acceptable to list "Release Payment" as one row and then "Send SWIFT message" as another row.
- So I'll add two rows:
   5a: "Release Payment"
         - Responsible: Transaction Analyst. 
         - Accountable: Transaction Analyst.
         - Consulted: Possibly Regulatory Liaison? But no, Regulatory Liaison might not be consulted for releasing payment.
         - Informed: IT Support might be informed? But the text says after release, then SWIFT message is sent by IT Support. But then a notification might be performed. 
         But usually, the releasing task does not require any consultation.
         I'll assign:
         Transaction Analyst: Responsible, Accountable.
         Regulatory Liaison: Informed? Not sure.
         IT Support: Consulted? 
         Actually, maybe I can rearrange: 
         Release Payment is done by Transaction Analyst who is responsible and accountable. It is likely that they consult with Regulatory Liaison if they are not sure if payment is cleared, but actual check is performed in Step 3. So I think don't include consult.
         So I'll mark:
          Row for "Release Payment": 
                Transaction Analyst: R and A.
                IT Support: N/A.
                Regulatory Liaison: not involved.
         and then next:
   5b: "Send SWIFT message"
         Responsible: IT Support.
         Accountable: IT Support.
         Perhaps Transaction Analyst consults IT Support when sending the SWIFT message? But the text says "IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent", which means IT Support is in the "responsible" role. 
         Possibly Regulatory Liaison is Informed about the sent message? But the text did not mention notifying Regulatory Liaison for sending SWIFT, it said "IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified" in Task 6.
         So for Task 5b, assign:
         IT Support: Responsible and Accountable, Transaction Analyst: being no role in this event. Possibly Regulatory Liaison is Informed too (but instructions said "the compliance officer is notified" only in Task 6, not in Task 5? Wait, the actual text says: "Once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent." It doesn't say Regulatory Liaison is notified. So I'll not assign any notification for SWIFT in Task 5.)
         Therefore, for Task 5: 
            Row for "Send SWIFT message": IT Support: Responsible and Accountable. No consult or inform necessary.

   Now Task 6: "Archive the case file; notify Regulatory Liaison."
         But then the text says "Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified." So this task is explicitly two parts: The archiving part is done by IT Support, and the notification by Regulatory Liaison is done. 
         But an alternative interpretation: "archive the case file" is a separate task entirely. Wait, careful: It says, "Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified." So the task of archiving the case file is done by IT Support, and the notifying is done or performed by IT Support? It might be that IT Support archives and then as part of that process, Regulatory Liaison is notified, but more likely the action of "notifying Regulatory Liaison" is performed by IT Support, but a RACI matrix would assign that responsibility to IT Support, and Regulatory Liaison is marked as informed. 
         However, if we look semantically: The transaction is not likely to be independently notified by Regulatory Liaison. 
         Let's detail Task 6:
         Subtask 6a: "Archive the case file":
               Responsible: IT Support. 
               Accountable: IT Support.
               Consulted: Possibly Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison? But likely not.
         Subtask 6b: "Notify Regulatory Liaison":
               Responsible: IT Support (because they do the archiving, and then notify the Regulatory Liaison, but it's not clear. But the instruction says "IT Support archives the case; the compliance officer is notified." But a typical notification in a RACI table, the notifying person is the "doer of the function"? Usually the notifier is the one generating the notification)
               So for notifying, assign IT Support as Responsible, and Regulatory Liaison is Informed. 
         But I have the choice: Do I split it into two rows, one for archiving and one for notifying? Possibly yes because they are distinct tasks.
         I'll produce:
            Task 6.1: Archive Case File: IT Support: Responsible and Accountable.
            Task 6.2: Notify (Regulatory Liaison): Responsible: IT Support, and Regulatory Liaison: Informed. And maybe Transaction Analyst is Consulted? Not sure.
         So I'll produce two rows for Task 6. Alternatively, I can combine it as one row "Archive and Notify," with roles across two columns. But tasks "Archive" and "Notify" are two separate steps. They could be combined if they are within the same workflow, but then RACI matrix breakdown is supposed to not be ambiguous because in a RACI table each task gets R, A, C, I designations.

I could produce the table with tasks numbered corresponding to the informal description numbering. But the table columns should be the three roles: "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", and "IT Support", while rows are tasks. And then I can combine several tasks if appropriate. Several tasks though, to catch nuances in the output.

However, the prompt says: "make a RACI table that covers every task" using the mandated vocabulary. So likely I should produce a table that breaks the tasks down and then assign the roles for each using the symbols R, A, C, I in the cells for the roles.

We must follow the vocabulary mandate exactly: 
- Instead of "Payment Clerk", use "Transaction Analyst" in all assignment
- Instead of "Compliance Officer", use "Regulatory Liaison"
- Instead of "Customer Due Diligence", use "KYC Review"
- And not use any other language for those roles.

I also know: The result is a markdown document.

I need table in markdown. Usually a markdown table header: 
| Task                                            | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |

Then rows with assigned RACI codes. But in a standard RACI table, we include three columns, with roles: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed? 
Wait, typically a RACI matrix has rows for tasks, columns for roles, and each cell contains a letter signifying which aspect: R, A, C, or I. 
However, some RACI tables also assign each column cell for each of the four columns. But actually, a common approach is to create separate columns showing each of the roles (e.g. "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "IT Support") and then separately designate R, A, C, and I using checkboxes. But instructions is ambiguous.

Alternatively, the RACI matrix could be drawn with rows for tasks and columns: "Responsible", "Accountable", "Consulted", "Informed". But then where do roles go? I think a more conventional RACI table as I've produced in org charts: tasks as rows, columns are roles. Each cell gets assignments R, A, C, I assuming each cell by eligible role's involvement. For example:

| Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Receive & log instructions | R/A   | I? maybe?               | maybe blank |
| Screen against sanctions list | R/A | maybe? |

However, options: Using a typical RACI table structure, I can have columns as: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support, and then assign each task as "R, A, C, I" in the appropriate corresponding cell. But if a task has 2 responsibilities for one role (say TA is Responsible, and also Accountable), I can annotate as "R/A". 
But the RACI table with rows for tasks and columns for roles often uses a changed structure with designations in each cell. 
Alternatively, I can set up a table with tasks as rows, and for each task indicate for each role if they are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, or Informed. I need to decide how to do it, perhaps columns become: "Task", "Transaction Analyst (Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed)", "Regulatory Liaison (RACI)", "IT Support (RACI)". I think I'll produce a table with tasks as rows and then columns showing which role is doing which function.

There is a standard format:
 
| Task                                           | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support   |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| 1. Receive and log transfer instruction         | Responsible, Accountable | Informed ? | Informed?   |
| 2. Screen the payment against sanctions list     | Responsible, Accountable  | Consulted?  | Not involved        |
| 3. KYC Review (on sender and beneficiary)         | Consulted?             | Responsible, Accountable | Not involved   |
| 4. Approve high-risk transaction                  | --                     | Responsible, Accountable | --             |
| 5. Release payment                                | Responsible, Accountable | Consulted or Informed? |  --? Possibly none?  |
| 5 (b subtask) SWIFT message transmission        | Possibly Consulted?             | Informed?         | Responsible, Accountable |
| 6. Archive the case file                          | Consulted?  | Informed?             | Responsible, Accountable |
| 6. Notify Regulatory Liaison                      | --                     | Informed?          | Responsible? But notification is done by? possibly IT Support notifies Regulatory Liaison. In analysis I'm not sure. I think I'll incorporate both parts in a single row:

But the instructions said "covers every task" so making additional subtask rows is often acceptable.

I have to shape it carefully:

Perhaps I'll re-read the original tasks list as given:

(1) A payment clerk (Transaction Analyst) receives and logs transfer instruction.
(2) The clerk screens the payment against the sanctions list. -> also Transaction Analyst.
(3) A compliance officer (Regulatory Liaison) performs the customer due diligence check on both sender and beneficiary -> Replaced with "KYC Review performed by Regulatory Liaison"
(4) If the transaction is flagged as high risk, the Regulatory Liaison must approve it.
(5) Once approved, the clerk (Transaction Analyst) releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent.
(6) Finally, IT Support archives the case file; Regulatory Liaison is notified.

I think I'll produce a table with rows:
Row 1: Instructions Logging and Screening (splitting tasks 1 and 2 into one row might be acceptable if they are contiguous).
Row 2: KYC Review (task 3 with subtask 4 if flagged).
Row 3: Payment Release and SWIFT Message Transmission (combining 5a and 5b)
Row 4: Archive Case File and Notification (combining 6a and 6b)

Yes, I can combine tasks that are sequentially executed steps. But tasks 1 and 2 are closely linked. But careful: The tasks are executed by Transaction Analyst. So perhaps I'll make rows:
- Row "Receive and Log Transfer Instruction"
- Row "Screen Payment Against Sanctions"
- Row "Perform KYC Review"
- Row "Approve High-Risk Transaction" [maybe subtask of KYC Review, but not necessarily separate row, I can incorporate as a separate row if necessary, but it might be confusing].
- Row "Release Payment" (which is executed by Transaction Analyst) 
- Row "Send SWIFT Message" (executed by IT Support)
- Row "Archive Case File"
- Row "Notify Regulatory Liaison"

That would be 8 rows but maybe too granular. However, in a RACI table, it's common to have a row for each distinct action element. But these tasks each represent distinct steps. But maybe it's too many rows.

Alternatively, I could combine 1 and 2 as "Transaction Admission" and 5a and 5b as "Payment Release & Message Transmission". Then similar for 6. But also need a row for "Approve high-risk transaction" (task 4) because that's a distinct decision gate triggered by screening results.

I must include all mandated terms in the table exactly.

Since the task said "covers every task", I must include all 8 tasks. But the text might count "KYC Review" as the one that includes the default compliance check, but not separate tasks. Let me re-read the instructions:

"Informal description: 
1. A payment clerk receives the customer transfer instruction and logs it.
2. The clerk screens the payment against the sanctions list.
3. A compliance officer performs the customer due diligence check on both sender and beneficiary. 
4. If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, the compliance officer must approve it.
5. Once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent.
6. Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified."

I see distinct steps: step 4 is a conditional sub-task. I might split tasks as: {Data Collection, Screening, KYC Review, High-Risk Approvals, Payment Disbursement, Case File Archiving, Notifications}. That is 7 steps.

But instructions say "covers every task" using informal description, so we can assign a separate row for each:

Maybe I'll use rows as:
Row 1: "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction"
Row 2: "Screen Against Sanctions"
Row 3: "Perform KYC Review on Sender and Beneficiary"
Row 4: "Approve High-Risk Transaction"
Row 5: "Release Payment"
Row 6: "Ensure SWIFT Message is Sent"
Row 7: "Archive the Case File"
Row 8: "Notify Regulatory Liaison"

That would cover each line in the process description. That might be the most straightforward approach.

But then I consider: Do tasks 1 and 2 always happen sequentially, so they might be done by Transaction Analyst in the same stage. But to cover every task with clarity, I'll produce separate rows for clarity.

Now I assign RACI roles:
For each row, I need to choose columns: Role names: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support. And then assign R, A, C, or I.

We must follow mandates (e.g., if Regulation Liaison gets purpose specifically for KYC Review, then use Regulatory Liaison names exactly. And use Transaction Analyst for all clerk tasks.)

Let's assign each row:

Row 1: "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction"
Who is responsible? The text says "A payment clerk" but mandated role: "Transaction Analyst."
Thus:
   Transaction Analyst: Responsible and optionally Accountable also?
   But which one is accountable for this step? Possibly Transaction Analyst, as they execute data entry.
I'll denote it as "R/A" for Transaction Analyst? But then for Regulatory Liaison? Not involved, so I'll leave them as "N/A" according to RACI principles. But then might assign Regulatory Liaison as Consulted? But not necessarily. 
Wait, let me evaluate: The process is: "Receive & log transfer instruction." That is an initial transaction that gets logged in the system. Usually, internal control, the clerk is not consultative for that. Possibly under RACI convention, every task should fall under one designation among the involved roles. It might be considered that Regulatory Liaison is later going to review the customer due diligence. So Regulatory Liaison is not mandated to review that input. So I'll assign for row 1:
   Transaction Analyst: Responsible and Accountable, maybe include Consulted? I'm thinking use R/A on one cell.
   For Regulatory Liaison, maybe "I"?
   For IT Support, likely "I," because they need to know that the transaction is logged? Possibly not.
The safest assumption if a step does not involve someone directly, leave that row blank or mention "N/A".
I prefer to denote by: 
Transaction Analyst (R/A), Regulatory Liaison (I) but if it is not required to be notified, then it's left blank. But usually in a RACI table, each column cell gets a letter if the role is involved and then "NA" or empty if not.

Maybe I want to list only the intended rows that are actually involved. But instructions say "covers every task", so I want to fill cells for each involved role columns only if they participate. 
I decide to mark cells that are not involved with "N/A" or just blank.

I can fill all cells for each row with a letter corresponding to roles that are involved.

Let me outline potential assignment per row:

Row 1: "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction."
- Who is performing? Transaction Analyst is performing this so they are responsible and accountable.
- Regulatory Liaison: Although they do not actively do this step, they may be informed about new transactions for subsequent KYC Review. But do they need to be informed at this stage? It might be that it's not necessary to inform Regulatory Liaison at the logging stage. However, in some processes, once a transaction is logged, the system might trigger a signal for KYC Review, and then Regulatory Liaison gets notified or consult with it? 
I might mark Regulatory Liaison as Consulted or Informed. But maybe not, because step 3 explicitly states Regulatory Liaison will perform KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary. That likely means regulatory liaison aren't involved in initiating data input. They might need to be consulted only if something is unclear, but I'm not sure if the RACE matrix lists a "Consult" for them.
Given that later, Regulatory Liaison reviews KYC so I don't assign them here.

I might mark:
Transaction Analyst: R, A, and no consult/information.
Regulatory Liaison: NA (or not assigned)
IT Support: NA

But sometimes in a RACI matrix, you might have to fill in names for non-involved roles with N/A. The instructions do not require to fill N/A entries, but it's typical to include all process participants.
I can include Regulatory Liaison and IT Support if they are not involved.

I think I assign:
TRX Analyst: Responsible, Accountable (R/A)
Regulatory Liaison: Not Involved  -----------------> I'll mark blank.
IT Support: Not Involved -----------------> I'll mark blank.

Alternatively, I can use a separate column design labeling each role with R, A, C, I in a single cell. But different RACI tables vary in style. A common style is a simple matrix with rows as tasks, columns as roles, and entries filled with R, A, C, or I to denote if that role has that responsibility, except blank means not involved. Let me do that.

Row 1: 
- Transaction Analyst: R, A. But I cannot put two letters per cell normally. I might denote "R/A" for that cell.
- Regulatory Liaison: N/A or blank.
- IT Support: N/A or blank.

I need to decide: To be safe, I believe following is a common format of a RACI table: column header for each role, then inside the cell, we put letter(s) for that role. So I'll do that.

For each row:

Row 1 "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction":
- Transaction Analyst: R/A (which stands for Responsible and Accountable).
- Regulatory Liaison: I blank (or NA).
- IT Support: blank.

Row 2 "Screen Payment Against Sanctions":
This is done by Transaction Analyst. So I assign:
- Transaction Analyst: R/A.
- Regulatory Liaison: Not involved in screening; maybe borderline Consulted if there's any doubts, but instructions do not indicate that regulatory liaison is consulted in screening. Perhaps I'll mark Regulatory Liaison as Consulted? 
Let’s check process. The sanctions screening is a compliance control step but is performed by Transaction Analyst. But sometimes Regulatory Liaison reviews critical data if any discrepancy arises. But step 3 is a separate process for KYC Review. So maybe I do not include Regulatory Liaison in step 2.
So I'll leave Regulatory Liaison blank, and IT Support blank.

Row 3 "KYC Review (on both sender and beneficiary)":
- This is performed by Regulatory Liaison. So Regulatory Liaison gets Responsible and Accountable. 
- Transaction Analyst may be Consulted? Possibly, they might confirm info, but the text doesn't say they are involved. Usually no, but maybe the "KYC Review" is a function that the Regulatory Liaison handles on behalf of the company compliance.
- IT Support: not involved in KYC Review. 
So assign:
Transaction Analyst: Possibly Consulted? But the original process doesn't indicate that the clerk consults with the regulatory liaison. The regulatory liaison may ask for clarification from the clerk, but not sure.
However, the text "A compliance officer performs the customer due diligence check" implies the role that does the check is solely the compliance officer. So Regulatory Liaison is responsible.
I decide to assign: Regulatory Liaison: R/A, and Transaction Analyst: maybe not involved? But what about the fact that the Transaction Analyst already has initial data? I could see if they might be Consulted. But not automatically. Let me assign:
- Transaction Analyst: Not involved (N/A)
- Regulatory Liaison: R/A
- IT Support: N/A

That is pretty clear.

Row 4 "Approve High-risk Transaction":
This is the conditional authorization performed by Regulatory Liaison. So assign:
- Transaction Analyst: None (N/A)
- Regulatory Liaison: Responsible and Accountable (R/A)
- IT Support: N/A

Row 5 "Release Payment":
- This is performed by the clerk i.e., Transaction Analyst after approval confirmed.
So assign:
- Transaction Analyst: R/A.
- IT Support: Possibly Consulted? Because maybe IT Support logs are needed if extra help for transaction release.
- Regulatory Liaison: Informed, because they need to know that payment is being released? But not necessarily, in fact the Regulatory Liaison might not need to be informed whether the payment is released because it's been approved earlier. But there's no explicit instruction "notify Regulatory Liaison" for this step, as the text says "once approved, the clerk releases the payment". The notification event is only mentioned in Step 6 for archiving. However, maybe in a cross-check, the Regulatory Liaison should check the release? But at a high risk, Regulatory Liaison was already involved. Here if transaction is not flagged high risk, there is no additional approval. So no role of Regulatory Liaison in releasing payment.
   Possibly IT Support might even consult with Transaction Analyst if needed.
I lean towards: Transaction Analyst: R/A; IT Support: Not involved. The Regulatory Liaison might be Informed? But not necessarily. In many processes, if a high risk transaction is flagged, then Regulatory Liaison is involved. But in a non-high risk situation, the transaction release is automatically triggered. So Regulatory Liaison doesn't necessarily need to be informed that the payment was released. 
I assume then: Transaction Analyst: R/A; Regulatory Liaison and IT Support: N/A. But also, since step 5 says IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent, that will be a separate row.
I might just mark the row "Release Payment" as:
   Transaction Analyst: R/A
   IT Support: N/A (we will handle SWIFT message transmission separately)
   Regulatory Liaison: N/A.

Alternatively, I can have a combined cell for both "Release Payment" and "SWIFT message" in one row. But maybe it's more clear to have separate rows.

Row 6 "Send SWIFT Message":
- This is performed by IT Support. So assign:
   IT Support: R/A.
   Transaction Analyst: N/A, Regulatory Liaison: N/A maybe (are they Informed? Possibly not required.)

Row 7 "Archive Case File":
- This is performed by IT Support. 
So assign:
   IT Support: R/A.
   Transaction Analyst and Regulatory Liaison: N/A.
But then step 6 also states that Regulatory Liaison is notified. That I already considered as another row.
Alternatively, I can merge the archiving and notifying into one row if it's better. But I'll separate them.

So row 7 remains "Archive Case File" with IT Support as R/A.

Row 8 "Notify Regulatory Liaison":
- Who ensures notification? The text says "IT Support" archives the file and then the "compliance officer (Regulatory Liaison)" is notified of that by IT Support. So the notifying action is done by IT Support? But typically, the notifier is the one carrying out the archiving, so I assign:
   IT Support: Responsible for notification.
   And Regulatory Liaison: is Informed (I) in that row.
So:
   IT Support: R/A for the notification? Actually, if IT Support is doing the archiving and then notifying, that is the same person. But it's different: the archiving step, they had R/A. So for archiving, IT Support remains R/A. But for the notification which is part of the archiving process is done by IT Support, so IT Support is Responsible, but then Regulatory Liaison is Informed. But since I have two separate rows for archiving and notifying, I might decide to combine them.
   Alternatively, I can leave the archiving in row 7, and then row 8 as "Notify Regulatory Liaison" is done by IT Support (Remaining R) and Regulatory Liaison is Informed. But then in the archiving row, who notifies Regulatory Liaison? That might be left in a separate row. 
   I must not double assign the same role as Accountable if there's already an account for archiving. According to step 6, a single process is: "IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified." I can treat this as one composite task with responsibilities split: IT Support does archiving and notifying, but if a composite task, then it's hard to designate Individual roles for each subtask and avoid duplication.
   Possibly I can combine row 7 and row 8 into a single row: "Archive and notify" with roles as follows:
   IT Support: Responsible and Accountable for archiving, 
   IT Support: Responsible for notification (or do we assign a separate Responsibility for notification separately? But then that's double assignment).
   However, if I want a clear RACI matrix that is not redundant, I have two rows: one for archiving and one for notification.
   But my initial plan wants to mirror the sequence. The instructions say "covers every task" so I should cover notifications. So I include row 8 "Notify Regulatory Liaison" even though it is a part of archiving but not distinct enough to warrant separate row.
   But then I'm left with two rows for IT Support tasks:
      Row 7: Archive the case file: IT Support: Responsible and Accountable.
      Row 8: Notify Regulatory Liaison: IT Support: Responsible and Accountable or maybe Responsible and Consulted? The Disclosure of task probably as "Performing notification" task done by IT Support, while Regulatory Liaison is the recepient (Informed) in that row.

But if I have two rows with exactly the same role (IT Support) as the doer, then I'll have repetition. 
Maybe it's best to combine: I'll create row 6 "Archive case file and Notify Regulatory Liaison". But then I combine roles:
   It says: "The clerk releases payment; IT Support archives the case file; Regulatory Liaison is notified." Actually the step 6 says that after SWIFT message is sent, then IT Support archives the file and Regulatory Liaison is notified. In the process description, steps 5 and 6 are sequential: after SWIFT message transmission, IT Support archives the file and notifies Regulatory Liaison.
   I see five steps: step 5 covers both releasing payment and sending SWIFT message by respectively Transaction Analyst and IT Support; step 6 covers both archiving and notification by IT Support and Regulatory Liaison.
   It could be merged into a two-step structure if needed.

Given that we want to cover every task specifically, it's fine if we have 8 rows: 
Row 1: Data input and logging.
Row 2: Screening.
Row 3: KYC Review.
Row 4: Approve high-risk transaction.
Row 5: Release payment.
Row 6: Send SWIFT message.
Row 7: Archive Case File.
Row 8: Notify Regulatory Liaison.

That is comprehensive. 

Now, fill in RACI roles for rows 5,6,7,8.

Row 5: "Release Payment"
- Transaction Analyst: Is Responsible and Accountable (R/A)
- IT Support: not involved in actual release (N/A)
- Regulatory Liaison: They are not involved in release because they have already done KYC and possibly flagged high-risk if applicable. However, transaction release might need to be validated by regulatory liaison? In our process, it seems the Transaction Analyst does release directly. So Regulatory Liaison I think remain uninvolved. So answer:
   Transaction Analyst: R/A, Regulatory Liaison: "I" is not designated because they are not notified.
   Possibly IT Support: not involved. So row 5: TA: R/A, RL: N/A, IT: N/A.
   But in the original text: "Once approved, the clerk releases the payment." But then the next phrase "IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent" is clearly separate because that's not part of the release process. So I'll assign row 5 as: TAR: Responsible and Accountable.

Row 6: "Send SWIFT Message"
- IT Support is Responsible and Accountable for this step. 
- Transaction Analyst: not involved.
- Regulatory Liaison: not involved, so assign N/A.

Row 7: "Archive the Case File"
- IT Support: Responsible and Accountable.
- Transaction Analyst: not involved.
- Regulatory Liaison: not involved, so N/A.

Row 8: "Notify Regulatory Liaison"
- IT Support: Responsible for sending notification to Regulatory Liaison? The text: "Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified." But notification - who does that? Does IT Support notify Regulatory Liaison? That is implied. So I will assign:
   IT Support: Responsible for notification, and Regulatory Liaison: Informed in that row.
   Alternatively, should I mark that as A for RL? No, because RL is not performing the notification, they are the recipient. 
   Transaction Analyst: not involved.

After re-checking IR, it might be better to merge row 7 and row 8 because they are part of one IT Support action. But then I'd have different RACI assignments for archiving and notifying. 
I might list them as separate rows to ensure clarity, though it is redundant in the doer.

Maybe I can combine them as a single row: "Archive Case File & Notify", with IT Support Responsible and Accountable for both archiving and notification, and Regulatory Liaison is Informed. This seems better to avoid duplicating the same role. 
I will combine row 7 and row 8 into one row since step 6 as described in the informal text also appears to be one logical outcome. IT Support archiving, immediately followed by notifying RL, thus it's one overall operation in step 6. But then what about the "Send SWIFT Message" that is in step 5 if not combined? 
Let's re-read step 5 and step 6: "Once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent. Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified."
So step 5 has two independent actions:
(5a) Payment release by Transaction Analyst.
(5b) SWIFT message by IT Support.
Step 6 has two actions:
(6a) Archiving case file by IT Support.
(6b) Notifying regulatory liaison.
Since SWIFT message sending and archiving are both IT Support actions, can combine them as a single row? Alternatively, it's usually best to keep them separate for clarity. But consider: SWIFT message sending happens immediately after release, while archiving and notification happen after release and transaction completion, so they are separated.
I might keep them separate. But instructions are ambiguous. 
Given that the initial text separately delineated these subtasks, I'll keep them as separate rows, but then each row's tasks which are performed by the same actor may be redundant. 
I think it's acceptable.

But I'll note that in many RACI matrices, each task gets a row. It's acceptable to have two rows performed by the same role. It's not redundant? 
Row 6: "Send SWIFT Message" and Row 7: "Archive Case File and Notify Regulatory Liaison" as a single row is also acceptable but then in separate rows, it's less clear if we want to merge them. Let me check the informal description: It explicitly says "IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent" (one action) and then "IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified" ( another action). So these are two distinct actions:
- Ensuring SWIFT message: IT Support.
- Archiving file: IT Support.
- Notifying: IT Support does archiving and then RFCinform the Regulatory Liaison.
I may combine Archiving and Notification because it's one step in the process after payment release. I'll accept combining them into one row to simplify the matrix.
So final rows:
Row 1: Receive and Log Transfer Instruction (Transaction Analyst).
Row 2: Screen Payment Against Sanctions (Transaction Analyst).
Row 3: KYC Review on sender and beneficiary (Regulatory Liaison).
Row 4: Approve High-Risk Transaction (Regulatory Liaison).
Row 5: Release Payment (Transaction Analyst).
Row 6: Send SWIFT Message (IT Support).
Row 7: Archive Case File and Notify Regulatory Liaison (IT Support and IT Support notifies Regulatory Liaison who is then Informed).

I'll then assign the RACI designation:

Row 1: Receive & Log:
   - Transaction Analyst: R/A, Regulatory Liaison: (blank, not involved) IT Support: (blank)
Row 2: Screen Payment Against Sanctions:
   - Transaction Analyst: R/A, others: blank.
Row 3: KYC Review:
   - Regulatory Liaison: R/A, Transaction Analyst: (Consulted maybe, but no, I see no requirement for consulting in KYC review by the data entry clerk. But perhaps the data entry might be asked to provide additional info if needed. The informal text "KYC Review" is clearly performed by regulatory liaison. The mandated vocabulary wouldn't allow any other person to be involved, so I'll mark Regulatory Liaison: R/A).
   - So no roles for others.
Row 4: Approve High-Risk Transaction:
   - Regulatory Liaison: R/A, no involvement of Transaction Analyst or IT Support.
Row 5: Release Payment:
   - Transaction Analyst: R/A, not others.
Row 6: Send SWIFT Message:
   - IT Support: R/A, Transaction Analyst: not involved, Regulatory Liaison: not involved.
Row 7: Archive Case File and Notify Regulatory Liaison:
   - IT Support: Responsible for archiving, but then also for notification? Actually requirement says: "IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified." In RACI, if a task is composed of multiple steps, each should be assigned as needed. But in the combined row, archiving is done by IT Support and notification is done by IT Support as well. But the regulatory liaison is just notified. So in this row, IT Support would be Responsible and Accountable for the combined steps, Regulatory Liaison would be Informed. 
   But if there are two tasks in a single cell, can I mark Regulatory Liaison as Consulted? Not really - they are merely notified so that's "I".
   So assign: IT Support: R/A, Regulatory Liaison: I, Transaction Analyst: N/A.

So final matrix:

Rows: labeled "Task", columns with name of Roles: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support.
Then for each row, write "R/A" in the appropriate cell if applicable. For roles not involved, leave blank. I might use N/A if needed.

The matrix in markdown should be properly formatted in a table, with columns labeled, e.g.:

| Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Receive & Log Transfer Instruction | R/A |        |      |
| Screen Payment Against Sanctions | R/A |         |        |
| KYC Review (on Sender and Beneficiary) |         | R/A |          |
| Approve High-Risk Transaction |      | R/A |         |
| Release Payment | R/A |         |         |
| Send SWIFT Message |         |         | R/A  |
| Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison |         | I | R/A |

That would be a matrix representing each role's responsibilities.

But wait, is it consistent with the instructions that we use only mandated terms? I must not mention any name that is not mandated. I must not use "Payment Clerk" but it seems I already replaced it with Transaction Analyst.
I must ensure KYC Review is used exactly when referencing the due diligence check.
I must ensure that Regulatory Liaison is used for compliance officer tasks.
I must ensure that Transaction Analyst is used for payment clerk tasks. 

Yes, I'm doing that.

I need to ensure that in my table I deliver the output in Markdown as requested.

I should also check formatting: use triple backticks maybe or only markdown table syntax.

I want to produce markdown table with column headings: "Task", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "IT Support". And then rows as described above.

Maybe I should include the mandated terms in each task description text. For example, tasks 3: "KYC Review on Sender and Beneficiary" rather than "Customer Due Diligence" check.

I must ensure to use the specific mandated term "KYC Review" in task 3. 
And "Approve" might be worded as "Approve High-Risk Transaction" but it's acceptable.

Now check if there's any ambiguity: 
- Step 1: "Receive and Log Transfer Instruction" I simply label as "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction" that's clear.
- Step 2: "Screen Payment Against Sanctions" is good.
- Step 3: "Perform KYC Review on Sender and Beneficiary" is mandated, so I call it "KYC Review (on Sender and Beneficiary)".
- Step 4: "Approve High-Risk Transaction" is clear.
- Step 5: "Release Payment" is fine.
- Step 6: "Send SWIFT Message" is fine.
- Step 7: "Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison" is merged row from step 6 where both occurred.

I also check if "KYC Review" should also include the consult? In our process, our "KYC Review" row stands solely as Regulatory Liaison performing the KYC Review. It might also include the approval if transaction is high-risk. But then we already have a separate row for High-Risk Approval. I allocated "Approve High-Risk Transaction" as separate row instead of including it in KYC Review row.
But perhaps, logically, the task "KYC Review" can't be final unless it reaches a high-risk condition. It might be integrated with High-Risk Approval. Alternatively, we can integrate them: "Regulatory Liaison performs KYC Review and, in the event of a high-risk condition, approves the transaction." But then it's two responsibilities in one row: one is reviewing and then making the decision which only may occur for high risk transactions. It's ambiguous if regulatory liaison's role should get split into two rows: one for performing KYC review and one for approval. 
But the original instructs: "If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, the compliance officer must approve it." That's specific decision. 
We need to include the conditional branch. 
I can add a conditional sub-row "Approve High-Risk Transaction" which will be only triggered if flagged. But I must include in the matrix representation all responsibilities regardless of condition? Yes, I can include it because it's part of the process.
So I think it's acceptable to have row 3 "Perform KYC Review (on sender and beneficiary)" with Regulatory Liaison (R) and then row 4 "Approve High-Risk Transaction" stemming from that KYC review, both done by Regulatory Liaison. 

I worry about duplication of roles, but not too much.
Alternatively, I could combine these two into "Regulatory Liaison - KYC Review and Approve high risk". But I worry that then it might be unclear with the question: "cover every task" then the high-risk approval is a task of its own. We need to consider every branch. I'll treat that as a separate row.

Now check row 8: "Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison". This uses a comma. Is that acceptable? Or should I use "Archive & Notify" all steps? 
Combining "Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison" is a good summary because the trigger "IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer (Regulatory Liaison) is notified" constitutes a combined operation. 

I must assign R/A for IT Support because archiving is done by IT Support. Notification: Regulatory Liaison is Informed in the corresponding row.
I assume that no other role is involved in notification because the process description says that notification flows from IT Support to Regulatory Liaison. 
Therefore, in the row, designate IT Support as Responsible and Accountable, Regulatory Liaison is Informed, and Transaction Analyst is not involved.

I now produce a neat Markdown table. Let me produce a table in Markdown.

I assume the format:

| Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Receive & Log Transfer Instruction | R/A          |          |          |
| Screen Payment Against Sanctions | R/A          |          |          |
| Perform KYC Review (Sender & Beneficiary)  |          | R/A       |          |
| Approve High-Risk Transaction |          | R/A       |          |
| Release Payment | R/A          |          |          |
| Send SWIFT Message |              |          | R/A       |
| Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison |   |   I     | R/A       |

I need to double-check: Usually, in a RACI, the letters are: Responsible = "R", Accountable = "A", Consulted = "C", Informed = "I". For cells with two responsibilities, sometimes denote "R/A" to indicate that the role has both responsibilities. 
I'll denote "R/A" appropriately.

It seems roles have a pairing: Transaction Analyst gets R/A in rows 1,2,5; Regulatory Liaison gets R/A in rows 3 and 4; IT Support gets R/A in rows 6 and 7 for the action of archiving notification.

Let's check if Regulatory Liaison is informed in row 7. I have that in my table: cell for Regulatory Liaison in row 7 is "I". 
But wait, in row 7 "Archive & Notify Regulatory Liaison", the notification is to Regulatory Liaison which is the notified party. So Regulatory Liaison should be marked as "I", not "A". 
And IT Support is Responsible for archiving, so they are R/A. 

That seems consistent.

The table is in Markdown. I'll need to ensure that I follow the mandated vocabulary. I check if only the terms ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "KYC Review") are used. 
I must check each:
Row 3: "Perform KYC Review (on sender and beneficiary)" uses "KYC Review" which is correct.
Row 4: "Approve High-Risk Transaction" is fine.
Row 1,2,5: "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction", "Screen Payment Against Sanctions", "Release Payment" are fine.

I must also check if in the table, I must use exactly "KYC Review" when referring to customer due diligence, so I've done that.
I must use exactly "Regulatory Liaison" when referring to previously referred to "compliance officer." I've not use that term anywhere except in row 3, 4,7. 
I must use "Transaction Analyst" instead of "Payment Clerk." And I've avoided the term "Payment Clerk" completely.
So it's compliant.

Now produce the table in Markdown. I'll produce it as:

```
| Task                                            | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| Receive & Log Transfer Instruction              | R/A                 |                     |            |
| Screen Payment Against Sanctions                | R/A                 |                     |            |
| Perform KYC Review (on Sender & Beneficiary)    |                     | R/A                 |            |
| Approve High-Risk Transaction                   |                     | R/A                 |            |
| Release Payment                                 | R/A                 |                     |            |
| Send SWIFT Message                              |                     |                     | R/A        |
| Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison   |                     | I                   | R/A        |
```

This is in Markdown format.

I will now produce something like that in my final answer. I must include the table in Markdown format. I'll produce it as plain text in a markdown code block perhaps.

I think it's acceptable.

I must check also if I should include task numbering? Possibly I'll include the numeral items. Possibly I can include a separate column "Task" but enough.

I can produce it as:

```
| Task                                            | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| 1. Receive & Log Transfer Instruction           | R/A                 |                    |            |
| 2. Screen Payment Against Sanctions             | R/A                 |                    |            |
| 3. Perform KYC Review (on Sender & Beneficiary)  |                     | R/A                |            |
| 4. Approve High-Risk Transaction                |                     | R/A                |            |
| 5. Release Payment                              | R/A                 |                    |            |
| 6. Send SWIFT Message                           |                     |                    | R/A        |
| 7. Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison|                     | I                  | R/A        |
```
I must include a similar table.

I want to check if some cell require the letter "I" where Regulatory Liaison is notified in row 7. I want to check also if I want to symbol "R/A" if one role is both Responsible and Accountable. I want to check if this is clear. Possibly I should denote "R/A" in column for the row if that role is both. But I'll keep it as "R/A" as per conventions.

Now output in Markdown without code formatting? The instructions said: "put the table in Markdown". So I'll produce it in a markdown table code block, i.e. three backticks markdown. In my answer I'll produce final table. 
I'll not add additional commentary. 

I'll now produce final answer in Markdown table.Below is one example of a RACI table that “covers every task” while strictly using the mandated terms. In this version the informal process was broken out into these distinct rows:

• A payment clerk’s role is replaced by “Transaction Analyst.”  
• The “customer due diligence” activity must now be called “KYC Review.”  
• The “compliance officer” is always referenced as “Regulatory Liaison.”

Note that in a real‐world situation you might combine or further decompose some steps, but the following table follows the six‐step process as described:

--------------------------------------------------

| Task                                             | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support  |
|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 1. Receive & Log Transfer Instruction            | R/A                 |                    |             |
| 2. Screen Payment Against Sanctions              | R/A                 |                    |             |
| 3. Perform KYC Review (on Sender & Beneficiary)  |                     | R/A                |             |
| 4. Approve High-Risk Transaction                 |                     | R/A                |             |
| 5. Release Payment                               | R/A                 |                    |             |
| 6. Send SWIFT Message                            |                     |                    | R/A         |
| 7. Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison |                     | I                  | R/A         |

--------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the assignments:

• Task 1 and Task 2 (“Receive & Log Transfer Instruction” and “Screen Payment Against Sanctions”) are performed by the Transaction Analyst who is both Responsible (R) and Accountable (A).

• Task 3 (“Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary”) is theResponsibility of the Regulatory Liaison.

• Task 4 (“Approve High-Risk Transaction”) is also handled solely by the Regulatory Liaison (R/A).

• Task 5 (“Release Payment”) is executed by the Transaction Analyst (R/A).

• Task 6 (“Send SWIFT Message”) falls to IT Support (R
