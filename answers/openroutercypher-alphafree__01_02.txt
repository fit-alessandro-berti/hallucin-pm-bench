The decision points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process are:

1. After **Dual Underwriter Split**, **Underwriter Alignment Gate** determines whether to proceed if scores differ by ≤2; else escalate.
2. **Amount Threshold Decision**, decides between system auto-approval (for < €15 000) and MBA (for ≥ €15 000).
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval** for amounts ≥ €15 000, where the board votes approve/reject.

3. Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
4. Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
