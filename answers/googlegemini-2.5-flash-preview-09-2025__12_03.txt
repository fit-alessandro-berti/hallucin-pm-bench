1. **No**

2. **Justification:**

The statement claims that "Validate\_Payment" *always* occurs *immediately* after "Receive\_Order." The log snippet provides counterexamples where other activities occur between these two:

*   **Case C002:** The sequence is **Receive\_Order** (2025-01-03T09:30:00) $\rightarrow$ Pack\_Items (2025-01-03T09:50:00) $\rightarrow$ **Validate\_Payment** (2025-01-03T10:05:00). "Pack\_Items" occurs between the two cited activities.
*   **Case C004:** The sequence is **Receive\_Order** (2025-01-03T10:05:00) $\rightarrow$ Check\_Fraud (2025-01-03T10:07:00) $\rightarrow$ **Validate\_Payment** (2025-01-03T10:20:00). "Check\_Fraud" occurs between the two cited activities.

(Note: Case C003 shows direct succession, and Case C001 also shows direct succession, but the rule fails if even one exception exists.)
