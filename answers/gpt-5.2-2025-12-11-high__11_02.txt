**To: COO, Acme Insurance — Q1-2025 Claims Handling performance exceptions (top 3)**

1) **Request_Documents** is the clearest bottleneck: **lowest throughput (190/day)**, **very high wait (150 min)**, and **extreme rework (22%)** with elevated **SLA breaches (5.5%)** despite short processing time (5 min).  
**Action:** Implement a “first-time-right” document package (standard checklist + dynamic templates) and require completeness validation before sending; target **rework from 22% → <10%** to release queue time.

2) **Review_Documents** shows the worst execution risk: **highest processing time (25 min)**, **high variability (stdev 9)**, and the **highest SLA breach rate (12.4%)**, plus reduced throughput (185/day).  
**Action:** Introduce structured review playbooks and triage (simple vs complex) to cut variability; aim to reduce **stdev 9 → <5** and **SLA breaches 12.4% → <6%**.

3) **Initial_Assessment** under-performs on flow: **high waiting (18 min)** and **SLA breaches (3.2%)** with moderate processing time (12 min).  
**Action:** Rebalance capacity at this step (staffing/shift alignment) to bring **wait 18 → <10 min** and reduce breaches proportionally.
