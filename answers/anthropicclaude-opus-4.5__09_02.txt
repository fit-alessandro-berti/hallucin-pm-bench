**The average cycle time for "Dual Authorization" cannot be determined because no timestamp data was provided in the supplied artefacts.**

The event log header confirms that timestamps exist in the original file (via the Time extension), but the actual `<trace>` elements containing the `time:timestamp` attributes were removed for confidentiality. The frequency table only shows occurrence counts, not durations. Calculating cycle time (complete timestamp − start timestamp) requires the actual timestamp values, which are unavailable.
