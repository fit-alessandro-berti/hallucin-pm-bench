**Executive Memo**  
*To: COO, Acme Insurance*  
*From: Senior Performance Analyst*  
*Date: [Insert Date]*  
*Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Analysis*  

**Three Worst-Performing Activities**:  
1. **Register_Claim** (avg_throughput: 280)  
2. **Check_Coverage** (avg_throughput: 270)  
3. **Request_Documents** (avg_throughput: 190)  

**Performance Explanations**:  
1. **Register_Claim** lacks SLA alignment (10% breach rate) despite rapid throughput (280/day) and short processing (3 mins). High rework (20%) and low variability suggest errors during claims entry, offsetting throughput gains.  
2. **Check_Coverage** underperforms due to significant rework (0.6% of cases) and SLAs breached (1.5%). Poor coverage verification processes likely cause repeated checks, impacting both speed and reliability.  
3. **Request_Documents** has the lowest throughput (190/day), prolonged wait (150 mins), and critical SLAs breached (5.5%). High rework (22%) suggests inadequate document requests or loose validation criteria, compounding delays.  

**Data-Driven Actions**:  
1. **Register_Claim**: Implement AI-based claims auto-entry with validation logic to reduce errors (expected throughput +10%, SLA reduction to 5%).  
2. **Check_Coverage**: Audit coverage verification workflows and deploy pre-emptive coverage reminders for high-risk policies to slash rework rates by 30%.  
3. **Request_Documents**: Standardize document templates and enforce automated SFTP uploads to cut wait times by 50% and SLAs to 3%.  

**Tight to the Table**: Metrics differentiations (e.g., throughput vs. rework rates) clearly prioritize these activities.
