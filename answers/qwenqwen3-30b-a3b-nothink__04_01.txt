**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1 (Any purchase order (PO) whose total amount exceeds â‚¬10 000 must obtain two approvals, first by a Procurement Officer and then by the CFO, before activity `Issue_PO`)** is **not fully satisfied**.  
   While the trace shows both `Approve_PO` (Procurement Officer) and `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO), the order of approvals is correct, and `Issue_PO` occurs after both. However, the rule requires **two approvals before** `Issue_PO`. In this case, `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO approval) occurs **after** `Issue_PO`, which violates the rule. Therefore, the approval sequence is **not in the correct chronological order** relative to `Issue_PO`.

2. **Rule 4 (No activity executed by the role Intern may directly follow an activity executed by the role CFO)** is **violated**.  
   Activity #7 (`Move_to_Quality`) is executed by the **Intern**, and it directly follows activity #6 (`Goods_Received`), which is executed by the **Warehouse_Clerk**. This does **not** directly follow a CFO activity, so this rule is **not violated** in this specific instance. However, the prior violation (rule 1) alone is enough to classify the trace as **non-compliant**.

3. **Rule 2 (If the trace contains activity `Expedite_Flag`, activity `Quality_Check` becomes optional but `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`)**:  
   - `Expedite_Flag` is present, so `Quality_Check` is optional. This is satisfied.
   - `Risk_Assessment` occurs at activity #9, **after** `Ship_Goods` (activity #8). This violates the requirement that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`.

   Therefore, **Rule 2 is also violated**.

4. **Rule 3 (After `Goods_Received`, activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities)**:  
   - `Goods_Received` is at activity #6.
   - `Three_way_match` is at activity #10, which is **four activities** after `Goods_Received`.  
   This violates Rule 3.

5. **Rule 5 (The trace must finish with `Archive_Record` and contain nothing after it)**:  
   - The trace ends with `Archive_Record`, so this rule is **satisfied**.

**Conclusion:** The trace is **Non-compliant**. The most critical violations are in **Rule 1, Rule 2, and Rule 3**.
