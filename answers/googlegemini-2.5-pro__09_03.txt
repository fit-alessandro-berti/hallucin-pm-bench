It is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity from the provided artefacts.

To compute these metrics, the specific `start_time` and `complete_time` values for every instance of the "Approve Invoice" activity are required. The supplied event-log stub (Artefact A) only shows the column headers and explicitly states that all data rows have been redacted. The information in the SLA catalogue (Artefact B) is also insufficient; the 7.8-day figure represents the average throughput time *between* the "Approve Invoice" and "Pay Invoice" activities, which is different from the cycle time (or duration) *of* the "Approve Invoice" activity itself.
