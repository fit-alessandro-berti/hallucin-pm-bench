1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**:
	- If the two risk scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues to the next step.
	- If the scores differ by **> 2 points**, the case escalates to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision.
2. **Amount Threshold Decision**:
	- If the loan amount is **< €15 000**, the system **auto-approves** the application.
	- If the loan amount is **≥ €15 000**, the application proceeds to the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** for a final decision.
