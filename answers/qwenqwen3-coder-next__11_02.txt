**Subject:** Claims Handling Process — Critical Bottleneck Alert  

Three worst-performing activities—based on low throughput, high wait/processing times, and/or high rework/SLA breaches—are:  

1. **Request_Documents** (throughput: 190/day; wait: 150 min; rework: 22%; SLA breach: 5.5%)  
   *Why*: Extremely high wait time indicates customer/caller delays; high rework suggests unclear document requirements.  
   *Action*: Implement an interactive checklist + automated SMS/email with *pre-validated* document lists upon claim registration—piloting with top 5 failed request types.  

2. **Review_Documents** (throughput: 185/day; processing time: 25 min ±9; SLA breach: 12.4%)  
   *Why*: Highest SLA breach rate and moderate-high variability; likely due to inconsistent reviewer training or ambiguous validation rules.  
   *Action*: Standardize triage logic via rules engine (e.g., “if document type X, rule-set Y applies”) and tiered review pathways—reduce manual review volume by ≥30%.  

3. **Initial_Assessment** (rework: 1.8%; SLA breach: 3.2%; throughput 270 vs. 280 in Register_Claim)  
   *Why*: Despite balanced throughput, it feeds downstream rework and SLA breaches (visible in Review_Documents).  
   *Action*: Embed real-time SLA countdown and auto-flag for missed early indicators (e.g., incomplete medical records) to reduce downstream defects.  

*Note: No other activity shows statistically distinguishable underperformance.*
