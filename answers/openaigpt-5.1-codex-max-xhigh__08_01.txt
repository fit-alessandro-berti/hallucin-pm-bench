Yes.

After the initial split, \(T_2\) and \(T_3\) are independent. For example:

- \(M_0:\ p_0=1\). Fire \(T_1\) to get \(M_1:\ p_1=1,p_2=1\).
- Fire \(T_2\): \(M_2:\ p_3=1,p_2=1\), and \(p_4\) is still \(0\).
- At \(M_2\), \(T_5\) is enabled: it sees a token in \(p_3\) and the inhibitor condition on \(p_4\) is satisfied. Fire \(T_5\) to get \(M_3:\ p_6=1,p_2=1\).

Here \(T_5\) has fired while \(T_3\) has not yet occurred; \(T_3\) could still be fired afterwards from \(p_2\) if desired.
