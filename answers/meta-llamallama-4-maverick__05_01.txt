To improve the process and meet the SLA, I suggest introducing a non-interrupting boundary timer event on the "Task_RequestDocs" (id="Task_RequestDocs") task. This will allow the process to auto-escalate if the task takes too long. The timer event will trigger a flow that bypasses the exclusive gateway's constraint and ensures the claim reaches "Task_Triage" (id="Task_Triage") within 48 hours. To achieve this, I'll add a boundary timer event to "Task_RequestDocs" with a timer duration of 48 hours, and connect it to "Task_Triage" (id="Task_Triage"), thus ensuring the claim is triaged within the required timeframe.
