Add a non‑interrupting intermediate **boundary timer event** (duration PT48H) attached to the **Task_Receive** (or **Task_Check**) activity. Connect its outgoing sequence flow to the existing **End_Done** (or an additional end event) so that if the token has not yet reached **Triage Claim** when the timer fires, it is diverted directly to the end event, triggering the required escalation and ensuring the claim reaches triage within 48 hours.
