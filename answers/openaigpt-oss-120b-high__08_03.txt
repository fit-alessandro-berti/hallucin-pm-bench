**Answer: Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**  

The shortest firing sequence that makes this happen is  

```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```

(​the order of **T2b** and **T4** may be swapped; any permutation of the three
transitions after **T1** that supplies both pd and pe works.)

---

### How the sequence works  

| step | transition fired | marking before | marking after |
|------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 0    | –                | p0 = 1 , all others = 0 | (initial) |
| 1    | **T1** (p0 → pa, pb) | p0 = 1 | pa = 1, pb = 1 |
| 2    | **T2b** (pa → pd) | pa = 1, pb = 1 | pd = 1, pb = 1 |
| 3    | **T4** (pb → pe) | pd = 1, pb = 1 | pd = 1, pe = 1 |
| 4    | **T5** (pd + pe → pf) | pd = 1, pe = 1 | pf = 1 |

After step 3 the marking contains **pd = 1** and **pe = 1**, the exact pre‑set of
**T5**, while place **pc** has never received a token, therefore **T3** (which
needs a token in **pc**) has not fired. Consequently **T5** can fire in step 4,
*before* any occurrence of **T3**.

---

### Why this is the **shortest** possible sequence  

* **T5** needs a token in **pd** **and** a token in **pe**.  
  *The only way to create **pd** is either*  
  – **T2b** (pa → pd) **or**  
  – **T3** (pc → pd).  

  Since we want **T3** *not* to fire, **pd** must be produced by **T2b**.  

* **pe** can only be produced by **T4** (pb → pe).  

* Both **pa** and **pb** are created only by the **parallel split** **T1**
  (p0 → pa, pb).  

Thus any reachable marking that enables **T5** without having fired **T3**
must contain the following transitions, each of which is indispensable:

1. **T1** – to obtain the tokens in **pa** and **pb**.  
2. **T2b** – to generate **pd** directly from **pa** (bypassing **pc**).  
3. **T4** – to generate **pe** from **pb**.  
4. **T5** – the transition we are interested in.

No two of these transitions can be merged or omitted:
- **T1** is the *only* source of a token in **pa** and **pb**.
- **T2b** is the *only* way to put a token into **pd** without first putting a
  token into **pc** (which would enable **T3**).
- **T4** is the *only* way to put a token into **pe**.
- **T5** itself consumes both **pd** and **pe**.

Therefore the minimum number of transition firings required to reach a state
where **T5** is enabled (and **T3** has not yet fired) is **four**, and the
sequence shown above attains this bound.  

Hence, it is indeed possible for **T5** to fire before **T3**, and the shortest
firing sequence is **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**.
