1) The average cycle time of “Review Contract” **cannot be derived** from the data provided.

2) The header only shows case IDs, activity names, and resources. All timestamp and elapsed-time fields have been explicitly redacted, and no durations per activity instance are given. Without either start/end timestamps or per-activity durations for each “Review Contract” event, it is impossible to compute an average. The historical benchmarks provided are for other activities and from a different segment, so they cannot be used to infer or estimate the “Review Contract” duration for this log.
