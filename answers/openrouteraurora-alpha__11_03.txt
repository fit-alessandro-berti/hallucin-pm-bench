**To:** Chief Operating Officer, Orion Credit  
**From:** Senior Process‑Performance Analyst  
**Date:** 12 February 2026  
**Subject:** Prioritized remediation of the three activities with the greatest SLA breaches and waiting‑time exposure  

Our analysis of the current process metrics shows that three activities are jointly driving the highest performance gaps:

* **Legal Approval** – average throughput time is 900 s, exceeding its 600‑s SLA by **300 s**; the average waiting time is 600 s.  
* **Risk Review** – average throughput time is 600 s, exceeding its 300‑s SLA by **300 s**; the average waiting time is 480 s.  
* **Credit Assessment** – average throughput time is 300 s, exceeding its 240‑s SLA by **60 s**; the average waiting time is 200 s.  

**Recommendations**  
- **Legal Approval:** Implement a parallel‑review workflow that splits the legal check into two sub‑tasks, reducing hand‑off latency and targeting a 30 % cut in waiting time.  
- **Risk Review:** Introduce an automated risk‑scoring engine to pre‑populate risk scores, aiming to lower the waiting time by at least 150 s while preserving decision quality.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Deploy a decision‑support dashboard that surfaces key financial indicators in real time, with a 20 % reduction in throughput time.  

These actions are grounded in the observed bottlenecks and should bring each activity back within its SLA envelope while improving overall process efficiency.
