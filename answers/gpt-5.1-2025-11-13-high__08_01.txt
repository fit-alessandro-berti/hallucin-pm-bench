Yes, T5 can fire before T3.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking is:

1. **T1**:  
   - From `p0(1)` to `p1(1), p2(1)`  
   - Marking: `p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0`

2. **T2**:  
   - From `p1` to `p3`  
   - Marking: `p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0`

   Here, T5 is enabled: `p3` has a token and `p4` has zero tokens (inhibitor condition satisfied). T3 has **not** fired yet.

3. **T5**:  
   - From `p3` (with inhibitor on empty `p4`) to `p6`  
   - Marking: `p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=1`

4. **T3** (can occur later):  
   - From `p2` to `p4`  
   - Marking: `p0=0, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=1, p5=0, p6=1`

Thus in the sequence **T1, T2, T5, T3**, transition **T5 fires before T3**, and all enabling/inhibitor conditions are respected.
