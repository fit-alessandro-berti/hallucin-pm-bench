**R1. Any purchase order with total_amount > €10,000 must have Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval.**
**Compliant** - Manager_Approval (event 2) followed by Finance_Approval (event 3) for €12,450 order.

**R2. If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval.**
**Compliant** - Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 is within 2 days of Finance_Approval on 2025-03-04.

**R3. Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods.**
**Violated** - Pay_Invoice (event 7) on 2025-03-06 occurred before Receive_Goods (event 6) on 2025-03-07.

**R4. If hazardous = true, a Safety_Inspection must occur after Receive_Goods and before Store_Goods.**
**Not Applicable** - The purchase order has hazardous = false.

**R5. If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step.**
**Violated** - Change_Request (event 4) occurred after approvals, but Ship_Goods (event 5) happened before new Manager_Approval (event 8).

**R6. Every case must terminate with Archive_Record.**
**Compliant** - Case ends with Archive_Record (event 10).

**NON-COMPLIANT**
