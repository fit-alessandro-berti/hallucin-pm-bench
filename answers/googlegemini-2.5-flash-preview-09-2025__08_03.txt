The answer is **yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

### Shortest Firing Sequence

The shortest sequence requires 2 firings.

**T1, T2b**

### Explanation

We need to reach a state where T5 is enabled (has tokens in $pd$ and $pe$) while T3 is still disabled (no token in $pc$).

**Initial Marking ($M_0$):** $p0=1$

| Step | Transition Fired | Resulting Marking ($M$) | Enabled Transitions | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | (None) | $p0=1$ | T1 | |
| **1** | **T1** | $pa=1, pb=1$ | T2, T2b, T4 | T1 is a parallel split, placing tokens in $pa$ and $pb$. |
| **2** | **T2b** | $pd=1, pb=1$ | T4 | T2b is the *shortcut* ($pa \to pd$), bypassing $pc$. T3 still disabled. |
| **3** | **T4** | $pd=1, pe=1$ | **T5** | T4 uses the token in $pb$ to supply $pe$. T5 is now enabled. |

At the end of Step 3 (Marking $M_3$: $pd=1, pe=1$), **T5 is enabled**.
In this entire sequence, **T3 has never fired** because the place $pc$ has never received a token ($pc=0$).

The sequence **T1, T2b, T4** enables **T5** without ever enabling or firing **T3**.

---

If the query requires the sequence ending with T5 firing (which makes more sense for a possibility question):

**T1, T2b, T4, T5** (This sequence is 4 steps long, but enables T5 before T3's enabling transition T2 fires, so the minimal sequence only requires 2 steps.)

If the query asks for the shortest firing sequence *that results in T5 firing before T3 fires*:

1. **T1** ($p0 \to pa, pb$)
2. **T2b** ($pa \to pd$)
3. **T4** ($pb \to pe$)
4. **T5** ($pd, pe \to pf$)

**T5** has fired. **T3** has not fired. The shortest sequence to achieve the goal is **T1, T2b, T4, T5**.

However, relying only on the instruction "give one shortest firing sequence" for the possibility:

The minimal sequence leading to T5 being enabled before T3 is enabled is:
**T1, T2b** (Marking $pd=1, pb=1$; T4 is enabled)

Followed by T4 to enable T5:
**T1, T2b, T4** (Marking $pd=1, pe=1$; T5 is enabled; T3 is disabled)

Since the user asks for the shortest firing sequence demonstrating the possibility, only the transitions leading to the necessary state are required. The state is reached in **3 firings**:

**T1, T2b, T4**

(If the question strictly requires T5 to fire, the sequence is 4 transitions long: T1, T2b, T4, T5.) Given the ambiguity, the simplest is the sequence to enable T5: **T1, T2b, T4**

Let us use the sequence that includes **T5** firing to be definitive:

**T1, T2b, T4, T5**
