**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process (May 2025):**

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – Must confirm ID card and mobile phone; failure halts process.  
2. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – Compares risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B:  
   • If scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check.  
   • If scores differ by **> 2 points**, escalate to **Harmonisation Committee** for resolution before continuing.  
3. **Amount Threshold Decision** – Based on loan amount:  
   • If **< €15 000**, auto-approve → proceed to Disburse Funds.  
   • If **≥ €15 000**, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval.  
4. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – Board votes to *approve* or *reject*; only path to disbursement for loans ≥ €15 000.
