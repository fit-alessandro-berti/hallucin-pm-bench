The claim is **not accurate** based on the event-log fragment. Here's the justification:  
1. **Case 1001**: "Authorize_Refund" (2025-03-01 08:30:02) occurs **before** "Update_Inventory" (2025-03-01 08:25:55) – this violates the claim.  
2. **Case 1002**: "Authorize_Refund" (2025-03-02 10:18:40) occurs **before** "Update_Inventory" (missing in this case) – no contradiction here, but the claim requires "Update_Inventory" to follow.  
3. **Case 1003**: "Authorize_Refund" (2025-03-03 10:15:42) occurs **before** "Update_Inventory" (2025-03-03 10:08:07) – again, the claim is violated; these activities are **out of order** in this case.  

The log lacks a single case where "Authorize_Refund" strictly precedes "Update_Inventory".
