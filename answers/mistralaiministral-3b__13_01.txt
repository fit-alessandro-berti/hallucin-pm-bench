1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs exactly **1** time in this fragment.

2. To calculate the percentage of all logged events that this represents, we first need to count the total number of events:
   - There are 18 events in total.
   - The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs once.
   - Therefore, the percentage is \( \frac{1}{18} \times 100 \approx 5.56\% \).

3. The case identifier(s) that contain **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** are:
   - Case A1002

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable:
   - **Small Sample Size**: The sample size is very small (only 1 occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check" out of 18 total events). This makes the estimate highly susceptible to random variation and does not provide a reliable basis for generalizing to a larger population.
   - **Lack of Temporal Distribution**: The log fragment only covers a single day (2025-05-01). Without knowing how frequently such events occur on other days, the estimate is not representative of a monthly frequency.
