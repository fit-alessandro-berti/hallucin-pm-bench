Based on the description of Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder, I can identify the pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel. Here is the list of pairs in alphabetical order:

* Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
* Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

These are the only two pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description. 

Note that I ignored Process A entirely as per your instructions and focused only on Process B. 

Let me know if I got it right!
