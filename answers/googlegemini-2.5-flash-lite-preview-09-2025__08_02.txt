This is an analysis of the reachability and sequence constraints within the given Petri net PN-8.

**Answer to Question 1:**
No.

**Answer to Question 2 (Explanation):**
Transition **T5** requires tokens in both **P2** and **P5** to fire ($\{P2, P5\} \rightarrow \{P6\}$).

1.  **P2** is enabled only by **T1** firing ($\{P0\} \rightarrow \{P1, P2\}$).
2.  **P5** is reachable only after **T4** fires ($\{P4\} \rightarrow \{P5\}$).
3.  **T4** requires **P4** to be marked ($\{P4\} \rightarrow \{P5\}$).
4.  **P4** is enabled by *either* **T7** or **T3** firing ($\{P3\} \rightarrow \{P4\}$ or $\{P3\} \rightarrow \{P4\}$ - *Correction: T7 and T3 both feed P4 from P3 or P2 respectively*).

Since **T3** deposits a token into **P4** ($\{P2\} \rightarrow \{P4\}$) and **T5** requires **P5** (which depends on **P4**), **T3** *must* precede the path leading to **P5**. Therefore, **T5** cannot fire before **T3**.
