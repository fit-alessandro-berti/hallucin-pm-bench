Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (step 4), which makes `Risk_Assessment` mandatory before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at step 8 while `Risk_Assessment` occurs at step 9, violating the required sequence.

2. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (step 6), `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance â‰¤ 2). However, `Three_way_match` occurs at step 10, which is 4 steps after `Goods_Received`, exceeding the maximum allowed distance of 2.

3. **Rule 4 violation**: Activity `Move_to_Quality` executed by role **Intern** (step 7) directly follows `Approve_PO_CFO` executed by role **CFO** (step 3), with only system-executed activities in between. This violates the rule that no Intern activity may directly follow a CFO activity.
