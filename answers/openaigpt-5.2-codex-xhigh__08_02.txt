**Answer 1:** **Yes.**

**Answer 2 (minimal sequence):**  
`T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5`

**Why:**  
T1 creates tokens in **P1** and **P2**.  
The **P1** branch can produce **P5** via `T2→T7→T4` without using **P2**.  
Thus after `T1,T2,T7,T4`, both **P2** and **P5** are marked, enabling **T5**, while **T3** has not fired.
