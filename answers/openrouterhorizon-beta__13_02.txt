1) Manual_Fraud_Check occurs 1 time.

2a) Percentage of all events:
- Total events = 48
- Manual_Fraud_Check events = 1
- 1 / 48 = 2.08%

2b) Percentage of unique cases (12 total):
- Cases with Manual_Fraud_Check = 1 (C05)
- 1 / 12 = 8.33%

3) With only one occurrence, estimates of duration, routing probabilities, or risk impact for Manual_Fraud_Check are statistically unstable and prone to overfitting. Models may overemphasize its timing or correlation with outcomes, skewing cycle-time benchmarks and misleading predictors (e.g., falsely treating it as a key determinant). Generalizing from this sparse evidence can produce unreliable bottleneck identification and poor policy decisions.
