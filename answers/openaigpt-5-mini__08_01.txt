Yes.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking is: T1, T2, T5.

Markings step-by-step:
- M0: p0=1, all others 0. (only T1 enabled)
- Fire T1 → M1: p0=0, p1=1, p2=1.
- Fire T2 → M2: p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0.
- At M2, T5 is enabled because it needs p3=1 and the inhibitor arc requires p4=0 (which holds). Fire T5 → M3: p2=1, p3=0, p6=1 (p4 still 0).

Thus T5 fires at step 3, before T3 has fired.
