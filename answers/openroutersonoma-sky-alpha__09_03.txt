I cannot compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Approve Invoice”, nor the standard deviation or 95% confidence interval, because the supplied event log (Artefact A) contains no actual data rows or timestamp values—only column headers with all content redacted for privacy—preventing any calculation of durations between start_time and complete_time for relevant events. The SLA catalogue (Artefact B) provides only a historical average for a different subprocess (from “Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice”) and no raw or distributional data for the specific activity in question.
