**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Process Performance â€“ Critical Improvement Opportunities  

**Top 3 Worst-Performing Activities:**  
1. **Request Documents**  
   - *Why:* Highest wait time (150 min), high rework rate (22.0%), and moderate SLA breach (5.5%). Long queue times suggest upstream bottlenecks, while high rework indicates poor initial request quality.  
   - *Action:* Implement automated pre-verification of claim eligibility and document needs at the *Register Claim* stage to reduce redundant requests.  

2. **Review Documents**  
   - *Why:* Second-highest wait time (30 min), high rework (5.3%), and high SLA breach (12.4%). Processing time variability (stdev 9 min) suggests inconsistent reviewer performance.  
   - *Action:* Standardize document review checklists and introduce AI-assisted validation for common document types to reduce variability and rework.  

3. **Initial Assessment**  
   - *Why:* Highest SLA breach (3.2%), significant wait time (18 min), and moderate rework (1.8%). This early step delays downstream flow and impacts end-to-end cycle time.  
   - *Action:* Introduce a rules-based automation layer for high-frequency, low-complexity cases to reduce manual handling and improve throughput.  

All other activities meet SLA targets and exhibit low rework, indicating stable performance. Focus on these three will yield the greatest ROI in reducing delays and improving compliance.  

**Recommendation:** Prioritize process redesign efforts on these three activities starting Q2.
