We have to produce a RACI matrix for all activities and roles described above. We need to use authorized vocabulary, i.e., use the specific activity names as defined. The user states:

- Use only the authorized vocabulary, i.e., "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring". These are the four activity names that we must always use, never synonyms. That includes not using synonyms like Preliminary Assessment, Customer Due Diligence, etc. So we must map the described process to those four activity names.

The narrative: A high-value wire-transfer request arrives to the Front-Office Analyst, who performs a Preliminary Assessment to ensure paperwork completeness. That presumably corresponds to "Intake Vetting". Then the file then moves to the Compliance Analyst for Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Sanctions Check (which is AML Screening). These likely correspond to "KYC Review" and "AML Screening". Then the analyst derives a risk rating (Risk Scoring). Cases score >70 go to Compliance Officer for approval; otherwise Treasury Ops can schedule payment. Once approval granted, Treasury Ops releases funds and notifies the originating analyst.

But we need to cover every activity and role described. The activities we have are:

- Intake Vetting
- KYC Review
- AML Screening
- Risk Scoring

Additionally, there is "Approval" and "Release funds/Notify" maybe also "Scheduling payment"? The user says: "Return the matrix as a Markdown table; do not rename, merge, or add activities." So we must list exactly the four activities: Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring. Do we need to include "Approval" or "Release funds"? The narrative includes other steps: Compliance Officer approval; Treasury Ops release funds and notify. But the instruction says: "Return the matrix covering **every activity and role** described above." The "activities" presumably include all steps (activities) described, not just the four with authorized vocab. But they also tell us to not rename, merge, or add activities, which suggests we cannot create new activity names beyond those described in the narrative. However, we must not use synonyms for those activity names. The description includes steps beyond the four activity names: "Compliance Officer approval", "Treasury Ops can schedule the payment", "Treasury Ops releases the funds and notifies the originating analyst". These are not covered by the four terms, but perhaps we can treat "Compliance Officer approval" as part of "Risk Scoring"? Or maybe we have to include them as separate activities? The user explicitly says: "Using only the authorized vocabulary, produce a RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) covering **every activity and role** described above." So we must use only the authorized vocabulary for the activity names. That suggests we cannot mention "Compliance Officer approval", "Treasury Ops scheduling payment", etc. as separate activities, because those are not part of the authorized vocabulary. So perhaps we need to incorporate those steps into the authorized activities. Or we might include them as part of "Risk Scoring" and "Treasury Ops" tasks, but those tasks are separate. The user says "Do not rename, merge, or add activities." So we cannot rename or merge. Does that imply we cannot add new activity names beyond those described in the narrative? The narrative includes these steps:

1. Front-Office Analyst does Preliminary Assessment → "Intake Vetting".
2. Compliance Analyst does Customer Due Diligence → "KYC Review".
3. Compliance Analyst does Sanctions Check → "AML Screening".
4. Analyst derives a risk rating → "Risk Scoring".
5. Cases score >70 escalate for Compliance Officer approval → maybe this is a decision step, but maybe considered as part of "Risk Scoring" if risk scoring includes escalation criteria.
6. Otherwise, Treasury Ops can schedule the payment.
7. Once approval granted, Treasury Ops releases the funds and notifies the originating analyst.

But we must produce a RACI matrix covering every activity and role described above. The roles are Front-Office Analyst, Compliance Analyst, Compliance Officer, Treasury Ops.

So we need to produce a matrix where rows are activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring). Actually the narrative includes all those four activities. The additional steps (Compliance Officer approval, Treasury Ops scheduling/releasing) might be considered parts of those four activities? Or perhaps they are separate actions that we should also include as activities? The user says "Do not rename, merge, or add activities." That implies that we cannot create extra activity rows beyond the four described. But we need to cover everything described, like "Compliance Officer approval" and "Treasury Ops scheduling the payment" and "Treasury Ops releases the funds and notifies". Those are separate actions. The question is how to handle them.

We need to interpret the instruction carefully.

Interpretation #1: We need to include all four authorized activities, but also include other steps, but we need to use authorized vocabulary for the activity names, so for those steps we need to find authorized equivalent terms. The only authorized terms are Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring. There's no authorized term for "Approval", "Scheduling", "Releasing funds". So we cannot include them because they'd be synonyms not allowed. So we must either treat them as sub-activities of the authorized ones. For instance, "Compliance Officer approval" is part of Risk Scoring? Or maybe the "Approval" is actually part of the "Risk Scoring" activity: because risk scoring leads to decisions (approval or schedule). So the authorized terms cover the decision making.

Thus the matrix should have four rows (activities). We need to assign R, A, C, I for each role for each activity.

Roles: Front-Office Analyst (FOA), Compliance Analyst (CA), Compliance Officer (CO), Treasury Ops (TO).

Now assign responsibilities.

Intake Vetting: This is the Front-Office Analyst doing preliminary assessment. So FOA is responsible. Who is accountable? Probably FOA also. Who is consulted? Possibly Compliance Analyst for any questions? Or maybe not consulted; but typically front office would consult compliance if needed. Who is informed? CO, TO maybe later.

KYC Review: Compliance Analyst does KYC Review. So CA is responsible. Who is accountable? Probably CA (the same role). FOA might be consulted to clarify details. CO might be consulted for higher risk. TO maybe informed.

AML Screening: Also done by Compliance Analyst (performing sanctions check). So CA is responsible. Also accountable. FOA may be consulted. CO may be consulted. TO maybe informed.

Risk Scoring: Analyst derives risk rating. This is done by Compliance Analyst again (or maybe FOA? It says "the analyst derives a risk rating". Could be either compliance analyst or FOA? The narrative says "the analyst" after the previous step: "the analyst derives a risk rating". Usually compliance analyst does risk scoring. So CA responsible. Who is accountable? Possibly CA (or maybe compliance officer?). However, "cases whose score exceeds 70 escalate for Compliance Officer approval". So the CO approves, implying that the CO has a role. The CO might be consulted for high risk. FOA is informed. Treasury Ops is informed for low risk (they schedule payment). Also for high risk they wait for approval.

Thus we assign:

- Intake Vetting: R = FOA, A = FOA, C = CA (maybe consulted), I = CO, TO.
- KYC Review: R = CA, A = CA, C = FOA (maybe), I = CO, TO.
- AML Screening: R = CA, A = CA, C = FOA (maybe), I = CO, TO.
- Risk Scoring: R = CA, A = CA (or maybe CO for high risk? However risk scoring is done by analyst, but accountability for risk scoring might be shared with CA. The approval process is separate). We'll assign CA as accountable. CO is consulted for high risk; FOA is informed; TO is informed.

But we also have to reflect "Compliance Officer approval" as part of risk scoring or separate? The user says we cannot rename or add activities, but we could incorporate the approval within the risk scoring. However, the matrix columns only have R, A, C, I. It does not differentiate decision vs execution. So it's okay.

Now we need to produce a RACI matrix in Markdown format.

We need to label columns: Activity, Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed.

Rows: Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring.

Now assign letters: R, A, C, I.

Should we list each role in each cell separated by commas, or use abbreviations? Usually you list initials separated by commas. For clarity, we can put abbreviations: FOA, CA, CO, TO.

Now assign tasks.

Intake Vetting:
- Responsible: FOA (R)
- Accountable: FOA (A)
- Consulted: CA (C) (since compliance might be consulted for any missing info)
- Informed: CO, TO (I)

KYC Review:
- Responsible: CA (R)
- Accountable: CA (A)
- Consulted: FOA (C) (maybe for source documents)
- Informed: CO, TO (I)

AML Screening:
- Responsible: CA (R)
- Accountable: CA (A)
- Consulted: FOA (C) (for any queries)
- Informed: CO, TO (I)

Risk Scoring:
- Responsible: CA (R)
- Accountable: CA (A) (since the analyst is accountable)
- Consulted: CO (C) (if risk >70, need approval)
- Informed: FOA, TO (I) (FOA for overall status, TO for scheduling)

But we also need to account for the CO's role in approval of high-risk cases. That could be considered "Accountable" for high-risk scenarios, but risk scoring is done by CA, and after scoring >70, CO has accountability to approve. However, our matrix lumps the activity "Risk Scoring". For a high-risk case, the CO might be accountable for the approval portion. But the assignment may vary based on risk. The user likely expects a simple assignment.

But to be more accurate, we can assign for Risk Scoring:
- Responsible: CA (R)
- Accountable: CA (A) (if risk <=70). But if risk >70, then CO is accountable for approval. But we can't separate because we can't rename activities. We could note in consulted that CO is consulted for high risk. However, to represent this, we could assign CO as consulted, not accountable. The narrative says "cases whose score exceeds 70 escalate for Compliance Officer approval". This is more of a decision step separate from risk scoring. But we need to allocate RACI. Possibly assign CA as responsible and accountable for risk scoring, and CO as consulted for high-risk aspects. But the approval step is separate activity not listed. The narrative says "Compliance Officer approval" occurs for high risk. Since it's not part of the four activities, but maybe we need to include that as an activity. The instruction says "Return the matrix as a Markdown table; do not rename, merge, or add activities." So we cannot add "Compliance Officer approval". But maybe "Compliance Officer approval" is actually "Risk Scoring"? Let's examine.

The phrase "Cases whose score exceeds 70 escalate for Compliance Officer approval; otherwise, Treasury Ops can schedule the payment." This could be interpreted as part of the risk scoring activity: the risk scoring includes the decision of whether to approve or schedule. So the accountability for that decision lies with CO for high risk and TO for low risk. But risk scoring is an activity (risk scoring). The decision is part of the activity, and the accountability for the decision is with the responsible role that executes the activity. But then we could assign "Risk Scoring" to be responsible by CA (the analyst), but the accountability for the decision should be CO for high risk and TO for low risk. However, RACI only has one accountable per activity typically (unless you assign a primary). Maybe we can assign both as accountable? Or we could assign "CA" as Accountable for risk scoring, because they derive the score. Then consult CO for high risk.

Alternatively, we could treat the "Risk Scoring" as a decision-making activity where the score determines the next step. The CO is consulted for high risk, but the TO is responsible for scheduling payment if low risk. But if low risk, TO schedules payment; that is not part of risk scoring. However, the instruction says we cannot rename or merge activities. So we cannot separate scheduling payment. Perhaps we could treat "Risk Scoring" activity includes both the scoring and the resulting action (approval or scheduling). Then TO is responsible for low risk scheduling? But that might be separate activity.

Given the confusion, we need to decide how to best comply with instruction while being practical. Probably they expect to map each of the four steps to the roles. The additional steps like "Compliance Officer approval" and "Treasury Ops schedule the payment" are not separate activities in the matrix; they are part of the flow, but not represented as separate activities. However, they ask to cover every activity and role described above. The narrative mentions steps beyond the four, but the phrase "activity" might refer to each step in the process. The allowed vocabulary restricts us to using the four names; however, maybe we can use "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring". So we need to allocate roles for those four only. They may not require inclusion of the approval/scheduling steps as separate rows.

Thus a simple matrix with those four rows is likely sufficient.

Now we need to confirm that we haven't used any prohibited synonyms. We must not write "Preliminary Assessment", "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)", "Sanctions Check", "risk rating", "risk score calculation". So we must only use "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring". Also not rename any activity. Ensure we only use authorized vocabulary. In the matrix, each row label will be exactly those names.

Now we need to use capital letters for abbreviations. Use "FOA", "CA", "CO", "TO". Provide cell entries separated by commas. The matrix format:

| Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intake Vetting | FOA | FOA | CA | CO, TO |
| KYC Review | CA | CA | FOA | CO, TO |
| AML Screening | CA | CA | FOA | CO, TO |
| Risk Scoring | CA | CA | CO | FOA, TO |

Double-check compliance:

- Intake Vetting: FOA responsible and accountable (makes sense). Consulting compliance (CA) is plausible. Inform CO and TO.

- KYC Review: CA responsible/accountable. Consult FOA (source). Informed CO, TO.

- AML Screening: CA responsible/accountable. Consult FOA. Informed CO, TO.

- Risk Scoring: CA responsible/accountable. Consult CO (for high risk). Informed FOA and TO (for low risk scheduling). That seems okay.

One might argue that CO is consulted for high risk, but they are actually the approver for high risk. But being consulted is okay.

Make sure not to include synonyms: We must avoid "Preliminary Assessment" etc. Already not used.

Make sure not to mention "Compliance Officer approval" in a separate row.

Thus final answer is a Markdown table.

Now we can generate final output.

We should also provide a brief explanation? The user only asks to produce matrix. So just return table.

Thus final answer: Provide table with above content.

Potentially include note that R, A, C, I are represented by initials of roles.

We need to ensure no prohibited synonyms appear. The table only contains activity names and role abbreviations. No synonyms.

Now answer.
