1) **Average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the provided data.**

2) **Why:**  
- The log excerpt includes only `case_id`, `activity`, and `resource`; **timestamps/elapsed-time fields are redacted**.  
- Without per-instance duration (or start/end times), the average in hours cannot be computed.  
- The historical benchmark gives durations for other activities, but **not for “Review Contract”**, so it cannot fill this gap.

If durations were available, the calculation would be:  
\[
\text{Avg cycle time(Review Contract)}=\frac{\sum \text{duration of each Review Contract instance}}{\#\text{Review Contract instances}}
\]
(There are 4 visible “Review Contract” instances in the shown rows, but their durations are unknown.)
