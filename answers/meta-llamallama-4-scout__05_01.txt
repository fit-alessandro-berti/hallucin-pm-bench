To bring the process into SLA, I suggest adding a timer to the "Start_Claim" event (ID: "Start_Claim") with a 48-hour duration. This timer will trigger an escalation path if the claim doesn't reach "Triage Claim" (ID: "Task_Triage") within the time limit. 

Connect the timer's output to an existing path that leads to escalation, or create a new sequence flow to "Task_Triage" with a condition to check if the timer has expired. Specifically, reconnect sequence flow "f3" from "Task_Check" to "GW_Docs" and add a conditional sequence flow from "GW_Docs" back to "Task_Triage" if the timer has expired. This ensures claims are triaged or escalated within 48 hours.
