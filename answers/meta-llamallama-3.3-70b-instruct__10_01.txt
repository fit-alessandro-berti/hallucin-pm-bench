To create a RACI (Responsibility Assignment Matrix) for the Order-to-Cash workflow, we'll map out the process using the preferred terminology. The activities and roles will be aligned as follows:

### Activities:
1. **Receive Application**
2. **KYC Review**
3. **Order Vetting**
4. **Payment Clearance**
5. **Record Update**
6. **Notify Customer**

### Roles:
- **Account Manager (AM)**
- **Compliance Officer (CO)**
- **Finance Clerk (FC)**
- **IT Support (IT)**

### RACI Matrix:

| Activity          | AM  | CO  | FC  | IT  |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Receive Application| R   | A   | I   | I   |
| KYC Review        | I   | R   | I   | I   |
| Order Vetting     | R   | A   | I   | I   |
| Payment Clearance | I   | I   | R   | I   |
| Record Update     | I   | I   | I   | R   |
| Notify Customer   | R   | I   | I   | I   |

### Key:
- **R**: Responsible - The role responsible for the execution of the task.
- **A**: Accountable - The role accountable for the correct and thorough completion of the task.
- **I**: Informed - The role that needs to be informed of the progress or completion of the task.
- **C** (not used in this matrix, but for completeness): Consulted - The role that is consulted and provides input during the task execution.

This matrix aligns the responsibilities of each role in the Order-to-Cash workflow using the specified vocabulary, ensuring clarity and adherence to the preferred terminology policy.
