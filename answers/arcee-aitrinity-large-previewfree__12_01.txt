No, the fact is **not accurate**.

In **Case 1001**, the sequence is:  
Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued  
Here, *Authorize_Refund* occurs **after** *Update_Inventory*, not before it.

In **Case 1002**, *Update_Inventory* does not occur at all.

In **Case 1003**, the sequence is:  
Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund  
Again, *Authorize_Refund* occurs **after** *Update_Inventory*.  

Thus, the claim is contradicted by the data.
