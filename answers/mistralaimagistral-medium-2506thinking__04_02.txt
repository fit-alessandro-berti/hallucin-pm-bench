**Summary and Answer:**

We analyze Compliance Rules R1â€“R6 against the event trace for case #47291. For each rule, the result and justification are as follows:

- R1: Compliant. Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval.
- R2: Violated. Ship_Goods did not occur after the last required approval (triggered by R5).
- R3: Compliant. Pay_Invoice on March 7 is after Receive_Goods on March 6.
- R4: Not Applicable. Hazardous is false, no Safety_Inspection required.
- R5: Violated. New Manager_Approval was not obtained before Ship_Goods.
- R6: Compliant. Event trace ends with Archive_Record.

Overall result: **NON-COMPLIANT**.
