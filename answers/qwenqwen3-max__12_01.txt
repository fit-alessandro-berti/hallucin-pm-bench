No, the fact is inaccurate.

In Case 1001:  
“Update_Inventory” (08:25:55) occurs *before* “Authorize_Refund” (08:30:02).

In Case 1003:  
“Update_Inventory” (10:08:07) again occurs *before* “Authorize_Refund” (10:22:18).

In Case 1002:  
“Update_Inventory” does not occur at all.

Therefore, “Authorize_Refund” never occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory” — in fact, when both occur, the order is reversed.
