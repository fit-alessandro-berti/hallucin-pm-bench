No, the claim is not accurate.

In the provided event-log fragment:
- In **Case 1001**, the sequence is: … → **Inspect_Item** → **Update_Inventory** → **Authorize_Refund** → …
- In **Case 1003**, the sequence is: … → **Inspect_Item** → **Update_Inventory** → **Quality_Check** → **Authorize_Refund**

In both cases, **“Update_Inventory” occurs *before* “Authorize_Refund”**, contradicting the claim that “Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately *before* “Update_Inventory”.

Case 1002 does not contain “Update_Inventory” at all, so it does not support the claim either.

Therefore, the fact as stated is refuted by the data.
