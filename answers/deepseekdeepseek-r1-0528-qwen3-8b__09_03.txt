I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or the 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" because the provided event log is a stub with only column headers, and all actual data values—including timestamps, start times, and complete times—have been redacted and are unavailable. Without access to the complete event log data, it is impossible to derive any metrics. The information from the corporate SLA catalogue, such as the historical average time from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice" of approximately 7.8 days, may not be based on the same dataset or time period, and thus cannot be used to compute the required metrics from the supplied log.
