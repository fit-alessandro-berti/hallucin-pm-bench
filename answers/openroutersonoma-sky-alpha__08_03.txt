Yes.  
T1 T2b T4 T5

## Explanation

The analysis determines whether T5 can fire in a reachable marking without T3 having fired previously, based solely on the net's structure and initial marking. To fire T5, tokens must be present in both pd and pe. The token in pe requires T4 to fire, which in turn requires a token in pb from T1. The token in pd can be obtained via T2b, which consumes the token from pa (produced by T1) and bypasses pc and T3 entirely.

Starting from the initial marking (p0=1, others=0), the sequence proceeds as follows:  
- Fire T1, consuming the token from p0 and producing tokens in pa and pb, resulting in pa=1 and pb=1.  
- Fire T2b, consuming the token from pa and producing a token in pd, resulting in pd=1. (T2b is chosen over T2 to avoid producing a token in pc, which would enable T3.)  
- Fire T4, consuming the token from pb and producing a token in pe, resulting in pe=1.  
- At this point, the marking has tokens in both pd and pe (with pc=0, so T3 remains disabled and unfired), making T5 enabled. Fire T5, consuming tokens from pd and pe and producing a token in pf.  

This sequence, T1 T2b T4 T5, reaches a marking where T5 fires without T3 having fired, as T3 requires a token in pc (from T2), which is not produced. The sequence is shortest, requiring exactly four firings to enable and execute T5, as each dependency (pa and pb from T1, pd from T2b, pe from T4) must be resolved sequentially or in parallel where possible, with no shorter path satisfying T5's inputs without invoking T3.
