The three worst-performing activities, based on SLA breaches and high waiting time, are Risk Review (300s over SLA, 480s waiting), Legal Approval (300s over SLA, 600s waiting), and Credit Assessment (60s over SLA, 200s waiting). Risk and Legal Approval each exceed their SLAs by 300 seconds, while Credit Assessment exceeds by 60 seconds, with all three exhibiting significant waiting times relative to throughput.  

• Implement standardized contract templates for Legal Approval to reduce review iterations.  
• Introduce an automated risk scoring matrix for Risk Review to minimize manual handoffs.  
• Allocate two additional credit analysts to Credit Assessment during peak case volumes (1,175 cases).
