We need to parse the XES fragment. It's a snippet from an event log with 10 lines (events). We need to answer three questions.

Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment? Let's count unique case identifiers.

Case IDs: C001, C002, C003. Those are the only ones. So distinct cases = 3.

Q2: For case C002, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use → as separator). Let's list events for C002 in order:

Line 2: case C002, concept:name="Receive_Order", timestamp 2025-03-01T09:15:10
Line 5: case C002, Check_Stock, timestamp 2025-03-01T09:22:55
Line 8: case C002, Arrange_Delivery, timestamp 2025-03-01T10:15:20
Line 10: case C002, Ship_Order, timestamp 2025-03-01T10:25:40

Thus sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

Make sure to use proper naming as per concept names: "Receive_Order", "Check_Stock", "Arrange_Delivery", "Ship_Order". Use arrow as separator with spaces: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order".

Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”. One per line, alphabetically ordered.

We need to find each event where "Ship_Order" occurs, then find the previous event (the event immediately before it in the same case). For each case, we need to check the activity preceding "Ship_Order". Then collect distinct activities, sort alphabetically, and output each on a new line.

We need to check events for all cases that have a Ship_Order event. Cases present: C001, C002, C003 (and maybe others, but not). Let's list events per case in order:

Case C001:
- Receive_Order (line 1)
- Check_Stock (line 3)
- Ship_Order (line 7)

Thus preceding activity for Ship_Order in C001 is Check_Stock.

Case C002:
- Receive_Order (line 2)
- Check_Stock (line 5)
- Arrange_Delivery (line 8)
- Ship_Order (line 10)

Thus preceding activity for Ship_Order in C002 is Arrange_Delivery.

Case C003:
- Receive_Order (line 4)
- Check_Stock (line 6)
- Ship_Order (line 9)

Thus preceding activity for Ship_Order in C003 is Check_Stock.

Thus distinct preceding activities are Check_Stock and Arrange_Delivery. Are there any other possibilities? No. So distinct set = {Check_Stock, Arrange_Delivery}. Sort alphabetically: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock.

Thus output: each on a new line:

Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock

Make sure to follow instructions: "list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order** (one per line, alphabetically ordered)."

Thus answer:

Q1: 3

Q2: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

Q3: Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock

We can format nicely.

Potential nuance: Could there be multiple Ship_Order events per case? No, each case appears only once with Ship_Order. So it's fine.

Thus final answer.

But ensure we address each question clearly. Provide answer with bullet points or separate sections.

Thus final output.

Let's produce final answer.

**Q1** – Distinct cases: **3** (C001, C002, C003)

**Q2** – Sequence for case **C002**:  
`Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`

**Q3** – Activities that directly precede “Ship_Order” (alphabetically):  

```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
