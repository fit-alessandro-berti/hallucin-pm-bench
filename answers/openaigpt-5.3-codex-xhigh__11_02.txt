**Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Worst-Performing Activities**

Q1 data shows three clear under-performers:

1. **Request_Documents**  
   - **Why under-performing:** Highest wait time (**150 min**), highest rework (**22.0%**), and high SLA breaches (**5.5%**). Throughput is also comparatively low (**190/day**).  
   - **Action:** Implement a mandatory document-intake checklist with system validation before requests are issued; use rework reduction (22% → <10%) as the primary KPI.

2. **Review_Documents**  
   - **Why under-performing:** Highest processing time (**25 min**), highest variability (**stdev 9**), and highest SLA breaches (**12.4%**), with low throughput (**185/day**).  
   - **Action:** Introduce standardized review templates plus complexity-based routing (simple vs. complex claims) to reduce variance and SLA misses.

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - **Why under-performing:** Elevated wait (**18 min**), relatively long processing (**12 min**), and third-highest SLA breaches (**3.2%**).  
   - **Action:** Rebalance assessor capacity to demand (**270 cases/day**) and set a queue-time control target (<10 min average wait).
