1. **The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time** (in case C05).  

2. **Percentage of activity inclusion:**  
   a) **All events**: There are 48 events in total. "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears in 1 event.  
      Percentage = \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 = 2.08\% \) (rounded to two decimals).  
   b) **All unique cases**: There are 12 unique cases. "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears in 1 case (C05).  
      Percentage = \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 = 8.33\% \) (rounded to two decimals).  

3. **Explanation for low-support activity risk**:  
   A low-support activity like "Manual_Fraud_Check" (1/48 events) can mislead analyses by underrepresenting its potential impact. Performance metrics (e.g., cycle time) may not reflect actual bottlenecks if manual checks dominate rare cases. Predictive models might overlook critical variables, leading to overgeneralized conclusions that ignore high-impact outliers when applied to larger data where such activities are more frequent. This risks underestimating variability and resource needs.
