**To:** Chief Operating Officer  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Top Underperforming Activities and Mitigation Strategies  

Process analysis identifies **Legal Approval**, **Risk Review**, and **Credit Assessment** as the three worst-performing activities, based on SLA breaches and excessive waiting times.  

**Legal Approval** breaches its 600-second SLA by **300 seconds** (900s avg. throughput), with waiting time at 600s. **Risk Review** exceeds its 300-second SLA by **300 seconds** (600s avg. throughput), coupled with 480s waiting time. **Credit Assessment** surpasses its 240-second SLA by **60 seconds** (300s avg. throughput), with 200s waiting time.  

To address these:  
- **Legal Approval**: Reallocate resources to reduce waiting time by at least 300 seconds, targeting queue bottlenecks.  
- **Risk Review**: Implement parallel processing or additional staffing to decrease waiting time by 300 seconds.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Optimize task sequencing to cut waiting time by 60 seconds, minimizing idle periods.  

These data-driven actions prioritize waiting time reduction—the primary contributor to SLA breaches—to realign performance with targets.
