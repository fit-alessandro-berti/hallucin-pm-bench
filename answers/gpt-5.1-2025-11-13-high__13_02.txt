1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in the excerpt.

2. Percentages:  
   a) Share of all events: \(1 / 48 \approx 2.08\%\)  
   b) Share of all unique cases: \(1 / 12 \approx 8.33\%\)

3. Manual_Fraud_Check appears in only one event and one of 12 cases. Any performance metrics (e.g., average activity duration or total case throughput) that include it will be dominated by that single instance. If we generalise from this slice, we might wrongly treat its observed timing or outcome as typical, or overfit predictive models around it. That leads to unstable predictions and misleading improvement ideas, because results hinge on behaviour of case C05 rather than a systematic pattern.
