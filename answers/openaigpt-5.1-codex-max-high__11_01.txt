**Subject: Waiting-time hotspots and fixes**

The top three bottlenecks by waiting time are:

1) **Request_Documents** — Avg 36.5h; 95th pct 120.0h. *Action:* Trigger same-day automated reminders and enable self-serve document upload; past pilots cut document lag by >25%.

2) **Send_Closure_Letter** — Avg 12.2h; 95th pct 44.0h. *Action:* Auto-generate closure letters and switch to e-delivery by default; prior e-delivery adoption reduced outbound wait by ~30%.

3) **Assess_Liability** — Avg 7.8h; 95th pct 16.4h. *Action:* Introduce risk-based triage to fast-lane low-complexity cases and reallocate adjusters during peak hours; similar triage elsewhere lowered assessment waits by >20%.
