The average cycle time for “Approve Invoice” cannot be computed exactly from the provided artefact A, as only the column headers and a masked event log are available—specifically, no timestamps or event values are present. Without actual start and end times for records, calculating cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence intervals is impossible. Therefore, no valid numerical result can be derived at this stage. Minimum data required includes discrete event records with precise timestamps and lifecycle statuses.
