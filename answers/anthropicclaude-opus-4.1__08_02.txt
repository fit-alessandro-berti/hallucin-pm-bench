**Question 1:** No, it is not possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Question 2:** T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5 to fire. To get a token in P5, we need the sequence: T1 (produces token in P2) → T3 (moves token from P2 to P4) → T4 (moves token from P4 to P5). 

The critical issue is that T3 consumes the token from P2 to eventually produce the token in P5. Once T3 fires, P2 becomes empty. While T1 does produce a token in P2 initially, this same token must flow through T3→T4 to reach P5. Therefore, T3 must always fire before T5 can be enabled, as T5 needs both a token in P2 (which T3 consumes) and a token in P5 (which requires T3 to have fired).
