No. In case C003, Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order (line 6 at 10:43 vs line 7 at 10:45), so it does not follow it; and in case C005, Validate_Payment appears (line 11) without any Receive_Order in that case at all. While Validate_Payment follows Receive_Order in C001 (lines 1–2) and C004 (lines 8–9), and occurs after Receive_Order in C002 (lines 3–5), these counterexamples show the “always” claim is false.
