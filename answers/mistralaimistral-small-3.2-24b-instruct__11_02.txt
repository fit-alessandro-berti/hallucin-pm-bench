**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance**

**Key Underperformers & Recommendations:**

1. **Request_Documents**
   - *Why*: Highest `avg_wait_time_min` (150 mins) and rework rate (22.0%), indicating bottlenecks and inefficiencies in document collection.
   - *Action*: Implement an automated document request system with real-time customer portals to reduce wait times and rework.

2. **Review_Documents**
   - *Why*: Longest `avg_processing_time_min` (25 mins) and high `sla_breach_pct` (12.4%), suggesting delays in manual reviews.
   - *Action*: Deploy AI-assisted document review tools to streamline validation and reduce manual effort.

3. **Initial_Assessment**
   - *Why*: High `avg_wait_time_min` (18 mins) and moderate `sla_breach_pct` (3.2%), pointing to inefficiencies in triage.
   - *Action*: Redesign the assessment workflow to prioritize cases based on complexity, reducing idle time.

**Note**: Other activities show acceptable performance, though *Check_Coverage* and *Approve_Claim* could benefit from further monitoring if trends persist.
