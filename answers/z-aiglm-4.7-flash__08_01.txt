**Answer:** Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 fires.

**Concrete Firing Sequence:**
1.  **T1** (Parallel split)
2.  **T2** (Normal execution)
3.  **T5** (Execution with inhibitor condition)
*(Note: You can optionally fire T3 afterwards, but it must fire after T5 to satisfy the condition.)*

**Justification:**
To see why this works, we trace the reachable markings:

1.  **Initial Marking ($M_0$):**
    *   **$p_0(1)$**
    *   $T_1$ is enabled (requires $p_0$).

2.  **Fire $T_1$:**
    *   Removes token from $p_0$. Adds tokens to $p_1$ and $p_2$.
    *   **Current:** $p_1(1), p_2(1)$.
    *   $T_2$ and $T_3$ are now enabled. $T_5$ is disabled (requires token in $p_3$, currently empty).

3.  **Fire $T_2$:**
    *   Removes token from $p_1$. Adds token to $p_3$.
    *   **Current:** $p_2(1), p_3(1)$. ($p_4$ is empty).
    *   $T_3$ is enabled. **$T_5$ is now enabled** because it requires a token in $p_3$ (which we have) and zero tokens in $p_4$ (which we have).

4.  **Fire $T_5$:**
    *   Consumes the token in $p_3$ and adds a token to $p_6$.
    *   **Current:** $p_2(1), p_6(1)$.
    *   At this point, **transition T3 has not fired yet** (it still has its token in $p_2$).

**Conclusion:**
By firing $T_1$, then $T_2$, we create a state where $T_3$ is enabled but $T_5$ is *more* immediate (and distinct) from $T_3$. T5 fires *before* T3 in this execution path.
