1️⃣ The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs **1 time** (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ The snippet reveals activity naming inconsistencies (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). If manual checks follow similar irregular naming conventions in the full log, an analyst searching strictly for the exact string would undercount the actual volume. Additionally, this small sample suggests a 33% manual check rate (1 of 3 cases), which is a statistically insignificant sample size that likely misrepresents the true monthly ratio of manual to automatic checks.
