1–2. I cannot compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Approve Invoice”, nor its standard deviation or a 95% confidence interval, from the information provided.

Reason (precise): Artefact A contains only the event-log schema (column headers) with all rows and all timestamp values redacted. To compute an activity’s cycle time, I would need, at minimum, the “Approve Invoice” events’ start_time and complete_time (or another duration field) for each occurrence, and enough occurrences to estimate variability; to compute a 95% confidence interval I additionally need the sample size and the sample standard deviation derived from those per-occurrence durations. Artefact B provides only SLA targets and a historical average for a different interval (“Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice”), not the start-to-complete duration of the “Approve Invoice” activity in the supplied log.
