**No.**

The claim fails in at least two cases. In case **C003**, *Validate_Payment* appears at line 6 (10:43) *before* *Receive_Order* at line 7 (10:45), meaning the payment was validated prior to the order being received — the opposite of what the claim asserts. In case **C005**, *Validate_Payment* appears at line 11 with no *Receive_Order* event for that case at all, so there is nothing for it to "follow." Because *Validate_Payment* precedes *Receive_Order* in C003 and exists without any *Receive_Order* in C005, the stated fact is not accurate with respect to this log fragment.
