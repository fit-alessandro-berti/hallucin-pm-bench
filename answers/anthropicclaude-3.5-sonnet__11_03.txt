Re: Critical Process Bottlenecks & Recommendations

Our analysis reveals three severely underperforming activities in our credit processing workflow. Risk Review shows the most concerning performance, exceeding its SLA by 300 seconds (100% over target) with waiting time consuming 80% of total processing time. Legal Approval follows with a 300-second breach of its SLA (50% over target), where waiting time accounts for two-thirds of total processing. Credit Assessment is running 60 seconds above SLA (25% over target) with waiting time making up 67% of total throughput.

Recommended actions:
• Risk Review: Redistribute workload among risk analysts, as the sharp drop from 1,175 to 480 cases indicates severe resource constraints
• Legal Approval: Implement parallel processing by splitting legal reviews between different specialized teams, addressing the highest waiting time (600s) in the process
• Credit Assessment: Add automated preliminary screening to reduce the 200-second waiting time that's driving SLA breaches
