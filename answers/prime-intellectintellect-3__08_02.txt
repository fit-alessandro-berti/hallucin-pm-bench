**Answer to Question 1:** Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking.

**Answer to Question 2:** A minimal firing sequence demonstrating this is: **T1, T2, T7, T4, T5**.

**Explanation (≤ 120 words):**  
T5 requires tokens in P2 and P5, while T3 requires only P2. Firing T3 consumes P2, preventing T5 from firing later. To enable T5 without T3 firing first, produce P4 via T2 and T7 (consuming P1 and P3, not P2). Then, fire T4 to produce P5, leaving P2 token intact. Finally, fire T5 while P2 and P5 are both marked. The sequence T1-T2-T7-T4-T5 achieves this: after T1, P1 and P2 are marked; T2 and T7 produce P4 without consuming P2; T4 produces P5; T5 then fires before T3 is enabled or fired. T3 never fires in this sequence.
