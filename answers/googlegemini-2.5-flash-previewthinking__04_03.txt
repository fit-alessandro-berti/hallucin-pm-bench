No.

**Justification:**
*   **Rule 1:** Satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occur once each and in the correct order (`Quality_Engineer_Review` is before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`).
*   **Rule 2:** Satisfied. Severity is High, and `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
*   **Rule 3:** Violated. `Notify_Authorities` occurred *before* `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` was complete, but the rule requires it not to occur until after *both* QE and RA are complete.
*   **Rule 4:** Satisfied (in terms of relative order of these specified steps). `Close_Case` occurred after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
