**Improvement: Add a boundary timer event to enforce the 48-hour SLA.**

Attach a **non-interrupting boundary timer event** (e.g., `Timer_SLA`) to `Task_Check` with a 48-hour duration. If the timer fires before triage is reached, trigger an **escalation intermediate throw event** (e.g., `Event_Escalate`) that connects directly to `Task_Triage` via a new sequence flow.

Alternatively, use an **interrupting boundary timer** on `Task_RequestDocs` (the potential bottleneck) that bypasses the normal flow and routes directly to `Task_Triage` after 48 hours from `Start_Claim`.

This ensures claims reach `Task_Triage` within the SLA without adding new tasksâ€”only leveraging BPMN timer and event mechanisms to enforce the deadline.
