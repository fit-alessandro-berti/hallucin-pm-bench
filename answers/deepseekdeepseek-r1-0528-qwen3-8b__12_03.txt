No.

**Justification:**  
The FACT is inaccurate. In the given event-log excerpt, we observe the following sequences where "Validate_Payment" is not the immediate successor of "Receive_Order":

1. **CaseID C002:**  
   - Sequence: `Receive_Order` (2025-01-03T09:30:00) → `Pack_Items` (2025-01-03T09:50:00) → `Validate_Payment` (2025-01-03T10:05:00)  
   Here, "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment", proving the FACT is violated.

2. **CaseID C004:**  
   - Sequence: `Receive_Order` (2025-01-03T10:05:00) → `Check_Fraud` (2025-01-03T10:07:00) → `Validate_Payment` (2025-01-03T10:20:00)  
   Similarly, "Check_Fraud" is an intervening activity, contradicting the FACT.

The FACT claims that "Validate_Payment" *always* occurs immediately after "Receive_Order", but cases C002 and C004 show otherwise.
