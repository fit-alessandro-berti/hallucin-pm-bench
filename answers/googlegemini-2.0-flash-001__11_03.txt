**TO**: Chief Operating Officer
**FROM**: Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE**: October 21, 2024
**SUBJECT**: Urgent Action Required: Key Process Bottlenecks

Data analysis reveals critical performance issues in several credit-application activities. The three activities with the worst performance, considering both Service Level Agreement (SLA) breaches and average waiting times, are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.

Legal Approval has an average throughput time of 900 seconds against a target SLA of 600 seconds, resulting in a 300-second breach, coupled with an average waiting time of 600 seconds. Risk Review exceeds its SLA of 300 seconds by 300 seconds, with an average throughput time of 600 seconds, alongside an average waiting time of 480 seconds. Credit Assessment has a throughput time of 300 seconds, exceeding its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, with an average waiting time of 200 seconds.

Recommendations:
*   For Legal Approval, **reallocate resources to expedite legal reviews, given 465 cases, potentially reducing the 600-second average waiting time**.
*   For Risk Review, **implement a parallel-processing system to cut down on the 480-second average waiting time, given the 480 cases requiring review**.
*   For Credit Assessment, **refine assessment criteria to streamline the process and reduce the average waiting time of 200 seconds, considering the 1175 cases**.
