**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** Chief Operating Officer, Orion Credit  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Three Worst-Performing Activities in Loan Processing Based on SLA Breaches and Waiting Times  

The loan processing pipeline data identifies Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment as the three worst-performing activities, evaluated jointly on Avg_Throughput_Time exceeding Target_SLA and high Avg_Waiting_Time. Legal Approval's 900s throughput exceeds its 600s SLA by 300s, with 600s waiting across 465 cases. Risk Review's 600s throughput exceeds its 300s SLA by 300s, with 480s waiting across 480 cases. Credit Assessment's 300s throughput exceeds its 240s SLA by 60s, with 200s waiting across 1175 cases.  

**Recommendations:**  
- Legal Approval: Assign extra reviewers to cut 600s waiting time for its 465 cases.  
- Risk Review: Fast-track reviews for its 480 cases to address 480s waiting time.  
- Credit Assessment: Boost assessor capacity to reduce 200s waiting time across 1175 cases.
