No

**Justification:**
The event-log excerpt contains direct evidence contradicting the claim that **"Validate_Payment"** always occurs immediately after **"Receive_Order"** without intervening activities.

1.  **Case C002:** The sequence shows **"Pack_Items"** occurring between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".
    *   *Sequence:* Receive_Order (09:30:00) → **Pack_Items (09:50:00)** → Validate_Payment (10:05:00)
2.  **Case C004:** The sequence shows **"Check_Fraud"** occurring between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".
    *   *Sequence:* Receive_Order (10:05:00) → **Check_Fraud (10:07:00)** → Validate_Payment (10:20:00)

Since intervening activities exist in Cases C002 and C004, the statement that this occurs "always... with no other activities in between" is inaccurate.
