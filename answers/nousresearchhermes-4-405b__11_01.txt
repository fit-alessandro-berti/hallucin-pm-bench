**Subject:** Action Plan: Reducing Waiting Times in Claims Process  

Based on the last 12 months of performance data, the three activities with the longest waiting times are:  

1. **#1: Request_Documents**  
   - Avg. waiting: 36.5 hours; 95th percentile: 120.0 hours  
   - **Action:** Implement automated reminders to customers after 48 hours of document request. Use SMS/email templates with direct upload links.  

2. **#2: Send_Closure_Letter**  
   - Avg. waiting: 12.2 hours; 95th percentile: 44.0 hours  
   - **Action:** Integrate approval workflow with automated letter generation. Trigger letters immediately upon payment/rejection approval.  

3. **#3: Assess_Liability**  
   - Avg. waiting: 7.8 hours; 95th percentile: 16.4 hours  
   - **Action:** Reassign low-risk claims to junior assessors automatically via a pre-defined ruleset. Threshold: Claims < $5K with no prior flags.  

Each action targets â‰¥20% reduction in waiting time by addressing root causes (e.g., customer delays, manual handoffs, and resource bottlenecks).  

**Next Steps:** Pilot Request_Documents action immediately; others to follow in Q4.
