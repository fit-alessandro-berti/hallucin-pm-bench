Subject: Process Performance Analysis - Key Bottlenecks and Recommendations

This analysis outlines the top three activities impacting process performance based on SLA breaches and waiting times.

Credit Assessment exhibits an average throughput time of 300s against a 240s target SLA, a breach of 60s. The average waiting time is 200s.

Risk Review has an average throughput time of 600s compared to a 300s target SLA, exceeding the target by 300s. The average waiting time is 480s.

Legal Approval shows an average throughput time of 900s against a 600s target SLA, a breach of 300s. The average waiting time is 600s.

Recommendations:

*   Investigate the high waiting time (200s) in Credit Assessment.
*   Analyze the significant waiting time (480s) in Risk Review.
*   Address the substantial waiting time (600s) in Legal Approval.
