### Added Tasks  
- Added task: `<task id="Task_VerifyIdentity" name="Verify Identity"/>`  
- Added task: `<task id="Task_RequestDocs" name="Request Additional Documents"/>`  
- Added task: `<task id="Task_FinalReject" name="Final Reject"/>`

### Removed Tasks  
- Removed task: `<task id="Task_ApproveLoan"/>` （original name: "Approve Loan") — replaced with `atomized loan authorization` canonical meaning and further refactored in v2)  
  *Note:* More precisely, "Approve Loan" was renamed in V2 under `auto-approve`, but a full task removal isn't present since approval still exists; however, the direct name replacement means no need to group as removed; rephrased note for clarity.  
- Removed gateway type: `exclusive` ↔ `inclusive` for `id="Gateway_Decision"` → `inclusive` in `v2`, with name change from "Eligible?" ("Excluded") to "Eligibility Check"  
- Removed Flow: Two flows to `<sequenceFlow id="Flow_3" ...>` in `v1` and their counterparts now replaced with more explicit `flow` flows in `v2` with clearer names (`eligible`, `missing docs`, `ineligible`), so multiple flows were revised from exclusive paths to open branches, but fewer found impacts; **a clearer removal subject occurs at gateway and flow renaming-flow clarification.**

### Gateway-Type Changes  
- Gateway type changed from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway` (ID unchanged: `Gateway_Decision`), with name changed from "Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check"  
- Flow paths now open with branching:  
  - Previously a single decision (exclusive) led to approval or rejection  
  - Now multiple target tasks from `Gateway_Decision` ("eligible", "missing docs", "ineligible") — though technically no gateways are replaced (they persist), but decision flow opened rather than a choice gate.  
**Clarification:** The "Exclusive → Inclusive" change refers strictly to transitioning from an exclusive gateway (single outcome) to an inclusive gateway (multiple outcomes), which was applied here, though inclusiveness is more about the semantic purpose than flow structure — thus, since the gateway itself stays the same, no namespace change, but effectively, the choice now consolidates earlier exclusive flows. Since gateway control flow shape changed behavior, and names reflected inclusion, treat it as structural change in decision flow.

### Summary per heading (final concise):

• **Added tasks**  
   - `Task_VerifyIdentity` (name: "Verify Identity")  
   - `Task_RequestDocs` (name: "Request Additional Documents")  
   - `Task_FinalReject` (name: "Final Reject")

• **Removed tasks**  
   - None formal removal in Open v1; the original "Approve Loan" task was replaced (in nature hidden by wording), but its task node does not survive in changing model — rephrased for clarity: the approval task encapsulated via green flow. If strict removal required, none explicitly removed — but name change within same task category. For strict grouping, consider it "moved" rather than removed.

• **Gateway-type changes**  
   - Gateway `Gateway_Decision` from `exclusive` to `inclusive`  
   - Gateway name updated from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check"  
   - Flow paths now drive multiple concurrent tasks instead of sequential exclusivity  

*Note:* The model’s "Eligible" decision state transitions and consequences are now explicitly mapped, with flows branching accordingly — the core gatekeeper changes the decision semantics and flow organization, regardless of packaging.  

For ultimate groupings under the original strict headings, some interpretations blur if gateways persist. However, strictly speaking:  
- **Gateway-type changes** list the transition (exclusive → inclusive), gateway id unchanged, but name + interpretation changed for clarity.  
- If interpreting "exclusive" (one path) to "inclusive" (multiple branches), thus logically an inclusive choice, the heading reflects a conceptual shift.  

If the question implies only structural change and not naming, then:  
**Gateway-type changes**:  
   - `exclusive`, `Gateway_Decision` restructured as `inclusive`, `Eligibility Check`  
   - Reflects altered decision flow structure (single vs multiple paths).

For compliance, the structured list under heading **Gateway-type changes** is as above.
