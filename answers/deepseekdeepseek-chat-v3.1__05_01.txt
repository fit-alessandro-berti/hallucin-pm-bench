To meet the 48-hour SLA to **"Triage Claim"**, add a non-interrupting timer boundary event to **"Task_RequestDocs"** (ID: `Task_RequestDocs`). This event should trigger after 48 hours from the start of the process.

If the timer fires, it will mean the claim is at risk of breaching the SLA. The event's outgoing flow should reconnect to the **"Task_Triage"** (ID: `Task_Triage`) to immediately escalate the case. This ensures the claim proceeds to triage automatically when the deadline is reached, even if document collection is not yet complete. The original path for completing `Task_RequestDocs` remains active.
