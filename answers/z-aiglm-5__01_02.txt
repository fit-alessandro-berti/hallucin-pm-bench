### **Decision Points**

    *   **Outcome:**
        *   If scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues to the **Neighbourhood Feedback Check**.
        *   If scores differ by **> 2 points**, the file escalates to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision before continuing.

    *   **Condition:** Evaluates the requested loan amount against the €15 000 threshold.
    *   **Outcome:**
        *   If **amount < €15 000**, the system auto-approves.
        *   If **amount ≥ €15 000**, the file proceeds to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval**.

3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**
    *   **Condition:** The Board reviews the application (for amounts ≥ €15 000).
