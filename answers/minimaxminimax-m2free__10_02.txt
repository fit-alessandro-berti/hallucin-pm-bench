I need to carefully analyze this task. The user wants me to create a RACI table for AtlasRemit's cross-border payment service. I must follow the vocabulary mandate strictly:

**Roles to use:**
- "KYC Review" (not "Customer Due Diligence" or "CDD")
- "Regulatory Liaison" (not "Compliance Officer")
- "Transaction Analyst" (not "Payment Clerk", "Processor", or "Agent")

**Tasks from the informal description:**
1. A payment clerk receives the customer's transfer instruction and logs it in the system
2. The clerk screens the payment against the sanctions list
3. A compliance officer performs the customer due diligence check on both sender and beneficiary
4. If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, the compliance officer must approve it
5. Once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent
6. Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified

I need to map these to the mandated vocabulary:

Tasks:
1. Receive transfer instruction and log in system → Should be "Receive and Log Transfer Instruction"
2. Screen payment against sanctions list → "Sanctions List Screening"
3. Customer due diligence check → "KYC Review"
4. High-risk transaction approval → "High-Risk Transaction Approval"
5. Release payment and send SWIFT message → "Payment Release and SWIFT Transmission"
6. Archive case file and notify → "Case File Archiving and Notification"

Roles:
- Transaction Analyst (from "payment clerk")
- Regulatory Liaison (from "compliance officer")
- IT Support (stays the same)

Let me create the RACI matrix:

For task 1: Receive and Log Transfer Instruction
- Responsible: Transaction Analyst (they receive and log)


- Accountable: Transaction Analyst (they handle this directly)
- Consulted: Could be IT Support for system issues
- Informed: Regulatory Liaison needs to know about new transfers

I'll map the Sanctions List Screening task. The Transaction Analyst performs the screening directly, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The Regulatory Liaison remains informed about any potential risk flags during this process. The IT Support team provides technical support for any system-related screening challenges.

The KYC Review requires thorough investigation by the Regulatory Liaison, who conducts a comprehensive review of both sender and beneficiary. This step is critical for preventing potential financial crimes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The Transaction Analyst supports by collecting and providing necessary documentation.

For the Payment Release and SWIFT Transmission, the Transaction Analyst coordinates the actual payment processing. The IT Support team executes the technical transmission of SWIFT messages, ensuring secure and accurate fund transfer. The Regulatory Liaison monitors for compliance and potential red flags.

The Case File Archiving and Notification requires careful documentation and communication. IT Support manages the technical archiving process, while the Regulatory Liaison ensures all compliance requirements are met through systematic notification protocols.

## RACI Matrix - AtlasRemit Cross-Border Payment Process

| Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **1. Receive and Log Transfer Instruction** | R, A | C | I |
| **2. Sanctions List Screening** | R, A | C | I |
| **3. KYC Review** | I | R, A | I |
| **4. High-Risk Transaction Approval** | I | R, A | I |
| **5. Payment Release and SWIFT Transmission** | R | I | R, A |
| **6. Case File Archiving and Notification** | I | I | R, A |

### Legend:
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)
- **A** = Accountable (ultimate ownership, sign-off authority)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input, two-way communication)
- **I** = Informed (kept updated, one-way communication)

**Key Mappings:**
- "Payment Clerk" mapped to **Transaction Analyst**
- "Compliance Officer" mapped to **Regulatory Liaison**
- "Customer Due Diligence" mapped to **KYC Review**
