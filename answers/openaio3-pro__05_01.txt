Attach an interrupting boundary timer event to “Request Missing Docs” (id Task_RequestDocs).

• New element: boundary timer id="Timer_48h", attachedToRef="Task_RequestDocs", cancelActivity="true".  
  timeDuration = PT48H (48 hours) and, if your engine supports it, timeDate based on process start (Start_Claim).

• Add a sequenceFlow from Timer_48h to Task_Triage (id Task_Triage).

Effect:  
When a claim is still waiting for missing documents after 48 hours, the timer fires, immediately interrupts Task_RequestDocs and routes the case to Triage Claim—i.e., an automatic escalation—so every claim reaches Task_Triage within the SLA. No new tasks or subprocesses are introduced; only one event and one flow are added.
