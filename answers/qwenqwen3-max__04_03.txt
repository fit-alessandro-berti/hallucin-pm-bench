**No**

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1 Violated**: Requires `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) to occur **once each and in that order**. In the trace, QE occurs before RA — which satisfies the order — but `Notify_Authorities` occurs *between* QE and RA (`QE → NA → RA`), which breaks the required sequence. RA must directly follow QE without any intervening mandatory activities breaking their required pairing.

- **Rule 2 Violated**: Since severity = "High", `VP_Safety_Approval` must occur **after both QE and RA**. Here, VP occurs after RA, so this *would* be satisfied — *if* Rule 1 were satisfied. But since RA is out of order (interrupted by NA), the prerequisite “after both QE and RA” is not validly met.

- **Rule 3 Violated**: `Notify_Authorities` must not occur until **after both QE and RA**. In the trace, NA occurs *immediately after QE but before RA*, which is non-compliant.

- **Rule 4**: `Close_Case` occurs after NA and VP, which would be compliant — *if* NA and VP were themselves compliant. But since NA and VP are executed on an invalid sequence, CC cannot “save” the compliance.

**Conclusion**: Multiple rule violations (Rules 1, 2, and 3) render the trace non-compliant.
