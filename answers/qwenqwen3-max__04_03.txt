**No**

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1 violated**: QE and RA must occur **once each and in that order**. In the trace, `Quality_Engineer_Review` is followed by `Notify_Authorities` **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occurs. This breaks the required **QE → RA** sequence.

- **Rule 2 conditionally triggered** (severity = "High"), but **cannot be satisfied** because VP occurs only after RA, yet RA itself happens out of order. Moreover, VP occurs **after** NA, which is not directly prohibited by Rule 2, but Rule 2 requires VP **after both QE and RA**—which technically holds in timing—but the earlier violation of Rule 1 already invalidates compliance.

- **Rule 3 violated**: `Notify_Authorities` occurs **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete, even though RA is required (along with QE) before NA.

- **Rule 4 is also compromised**: `Close_Case` occurs after NA and VP, which would be acceptable **if** prior rules were met—but since NA occurred prematurely (Rule 3 violation), CC is based on an invalid sequence.

Thus, the trace violates **Rules 1 and 3** (and indirectly affects Rules 2 and 4).
