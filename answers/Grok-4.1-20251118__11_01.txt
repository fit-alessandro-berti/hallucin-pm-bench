**Executive Memo – Claims Process Bottlenecks**

**To:** COO, Orion Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Mining Analyst  
**Date:** 18 November 2025  
**Subject:** Top 3 Activities by Waiting Time & Targeted Improvement Actions

The three worst-performing activities by waiting time (last 12 months) are:

1. **Request_Documents**  
   Avg wait: 36.5 h | 95th percentile: 120.0 h  
   **Action:** Automate initial document requests via pre-filled claimant portal checklists → expected ≥30 % wait reduction through fewer manual triggers and reminders.

2. **Send_Closure_Letter**  
   Avg wait: 12.2 h | 95th percentile: 44.0 h  
   **Action:** Implement straight-through digital letter generation and e-delivery immediately after decision → expected ≥25 % wait reduction by eliminating batch printing queues.

3. **Assess_Liability**  
   Avg wait: 7.8 h | 95th percentile: 16.4 h  
   **Action:** Route medium-complexity cases to dedicated fast-track assessors with pre-loaded liability rules engine → expected ≥20 % wait reduction via workload balancing.

Immediate implementation of these three measures will materially reduce claimant waiting friction.
