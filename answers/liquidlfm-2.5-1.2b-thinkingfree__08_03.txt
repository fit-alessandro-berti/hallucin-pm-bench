Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before **T3**. A valid shortest sequence is **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**. 

**Explanation:**  
- Start with `p0=1`, `pa=pb=0` others 0.  
- **T1** activates, setting `pa=1`, `pb=1`.  
- **T2b** triggers (using `pa=1`), outputting `pd=1`. Now `pd=1`, but `pe=0`.  
- **T4** (using `pb=1`) sets `pe=1`, achieving both `pd=1` and `pe=1`.  
- **T5** then executes since `pd=1` and `pe=1`.  

This sequence achieves `T5` firing before proceeding to `T3`, which requires `pc=1` (achieved during earlier steps) but precedes `T3` as `T3` hasn't been activated yet in this timeline. Thus, **T5 precedes T3**. 

**Answer:**  
Yes. The shortest sequence is **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**.  

\boxed{Yes}
