In Q1‑2025, three activities stand out as underperforming:

- **Request_Documents**: Lowest throughput drop (190/day vs. 270 prior), extreme queueing (150 min wait) and very high rework (22% repeat), driving 5.5% SLA breaches. Action: Add capacity or automate intake in this step to cut the 150‑minute wait, and standardize/document templates to reduce the 22% rework loop.

- **Review_Documents**: High queue (30 min), longest processing time (25 min) with high variability (9 min stdev), elevated rework (5.3%) and the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%). Action: Introduce a standardized review checklist and targeted training to reduce the 9‑minute variability and 25‑minute execution time, and prioritize aged cases to lower SLA breaches.

- **Initial_Assessment**: Next highest waits (18 min) and processing times (12 min) with above‑average rework (1.8%) and SLA breaches (3.2%). Action: Rebalance staffing toward this step and streamline assessment criteria to trim the 18‑minute queue and lower the 3.2% breach rate.
