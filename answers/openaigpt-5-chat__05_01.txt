Add an **intermediate timer boundary event** to `Task_RequestDocs` (id: `Task_RequestDocs`) set to trigger after 48 hours from claim submission. Connect this timer’s outgoing sequence flow directly to `Task_Triage` (`Task_Triage`). This ensures that if missing documents are not obtained in time, the claim is automatically routed to triage—meeting the SLA without adding new tasks, while retaining the option to continue the normal path if docs arrive earlier.
