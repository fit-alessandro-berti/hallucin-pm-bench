Let’s go step‑by‑step.

---

**1. Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  

Looking at the CSV lines:  
Only one line matches exactly `Manual_Fraud_Check`:

```
A1002,2025-05-01T10:50:00,Manual_Fraud_Check
```

**Answer:** **1**

---

**2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  

- Total number of log lines: the provided fragment has 18 lines.  
- “Manual_Fraud_Check” count: 1.  

Percentage = \( \frac{1}{18} \times 100 \) = **5.56 %** (rounded to two decimals).

**Answer:** **5.56 %**

---

**3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  

From the fragment:  
- `A1002` contains the `Manual_Fraud_Check` activity.

**Answer:** **A1002**

---

**4. Two sampling-related reasons why using only this fragment to estimate monthly frequency is unreliable.**

- **Small sample size**: The fragment has only 18 events from a very limited set of (4) cases, so random variation could lead to a large error in the estimate.
- **Short observation window / lack of representativeness**: All events are from a single date (2025‑05‑01). Activity frequencies over one day may not reflect patterns over an entire month (e.g., demand cycles, special events, fraud spikes).

---

**Final answers:**

1. **1**  
2. **5.56 %**  
3. **A1002**  
4. **(a)** Sample size is too small. **(b)** The data covers only a single day, which may not represent the monthly pattern.
