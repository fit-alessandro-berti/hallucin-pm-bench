Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First, Q1 asks for the number of distinct cases in the log. I need to look at each event and count how many unique case IDs there are. Let me go through the lines:

1. C001
2. C002
3. C001
4. C003
5. C002
6. C003
7. C001
8. C002
9. C003
10. C002

So, the distinct cases are C001, C002, and C003. That's three different cases. So the answer to Q1 is 3.

Next, Q2 is about case C002 and the sequence of activities in the order they occurred. I need to filter the events for case C002 and then list the activities in chronological order. Let's look at the events for C002:

Line 2: Receive_Order
Line 5: Check_Stock
Line 8: Arrange_Delivery
Line 10: Ship_Order

So the sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order. That's the sequence for C002.

Now, Q3 asks for all distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" across all cases, listed alphabetically. To find this, I need to look at each event that has "Ship_Order" and check the previous event in the same case.

Let's go through each case:

- Case C001: Has Ship_Order (line 7). The previous event is line 3, which is Check_Stock.
- Case C002: Has Ship_Order (line 10). The previous event is line 8, which is Arrange_Delivery.
- Case C003: Has Ship_Order (line 9). The previous event is line 6, which is Check_Stock.

So the activities that immediately precede Ship_Order are Check_Stock and Arrange_Delivery. Alphabetically ordered, that's:

Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
**A1.** 3 distinct cases are present in this fragment.

**A2.** For case "C002", the sequence of activities is:
`Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`

**A3.** The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
