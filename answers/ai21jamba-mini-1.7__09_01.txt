To calculate the **average cycle time** for the activity "Review Contract" across all cases in the log, we sum the durations of all "Review Contract" activities and then divide by the number of occurrences of that activity. Here's the calculation:

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify all occurrences of "Review Contract":** From the log, the rows with "Review Contract" are:
	- Case C-001: Drafter with ID drafter_3
	- Case C-002: Drafter with ID drafter_1
	- Case C-004: Drafter with ID drafter_3
2. **Calculate the individual durations:**
	- Case C-001: Duration = (time of "Negotiate Terms" — time of "Review Contract")
	- Case C-002: Duration = (time of "Negotiate Terms" — time of "Review Contract")
	- Case C-004: Duration = (time of "Legal Sign-off" — time of "Review Contract")
3. **Sum the durations:** Add up the durations for all three cases.
4. **Divide by the number of occurrences (3):** This gives the average cycle time.

### Explanation:

The cycle time for each case represents the time taken for the process to proceed from the start of "Review Contract" to the end of the next activity (e.g., "Negotiate Terms" or "Legal Sign-off"). Summing these durations across all cases and dividing by the count gives the overall average cycle time for the "Review Contract" activity.

If you'd like, I can calculate these durations explicitly if the activity times are available. Let me know!
