Based on the artefacts provided, the following conclusions can be drawn based on available data:

1. **Average Cycle Time of "Approve Invoice"**:  
   I am unable to compute the average cycle time of activity "Approve Invoice" because the supplied event log (Artefact A) is redacted. All timestamps required to calculate duration differences between start_time and complete_time are withheld, and no sample data is visible to perform any calculations.

2. **Standard Deviation and 95% Confidence Interval**:  
   I cannot calculate either the standard deviation or the 95% confidence interval for the cycle time of "Approve Invoice" due to the absence of timestamp data in the event log. Numerical statistics require empirical observations, which are missing from the provided artefacts.

3. **Precise Reasoning**:  
   The computation of average cycle time and its statistical measures requires pairs of timestamps (i.e., start_time and complete_time) for the activity in question. Without these temporal values present in the event-log stub, it's impossible to derive any time-based metrics with precision or accuracy.

While corporate SLA standards are given, they pertain to aggregate workflows beyond single-activity metrics, further limiting inference.
