Subject: Three Worst-Performing Activities and Targeted Actions  

1. **Risk Review** exhibits the highest joint violation: Waiting Time (480s) exceeds the SLA by 180 seconds, while remaining the primary SLA violator.  
2. **Legal Approval** shows severe Waiting Time strain (600s), failing to meet its own SLA of 600 seconds—indicating operational bottlenecks.  
3. **Credit Assessment** maintains a waiting time of 200 seconds, second only to Legal Approval but operates *just* within its SLA, highlighting latent inefficiencies.  

**Quantified SLA Breaches**:  
- Risk Review: 180 seconds over SLA.  
- Legal Approval: 0 seconds breach (equating time to SLA, implying meeting threshold but with high baseline latency).  
- Credit Assessment: Consistent under SLA (24%), yet critical for case progression.  

**Recommmended Actions**:  
- For **Risk Review**, implement workload forecasting and redistributive staffing to mitigate bottlenecks.  
- For **Legal Approval**, deploy automated case routing to reduce manual delays.  
- For **Credit Assessment**, standardize assessment criteria to minimize process variability.
