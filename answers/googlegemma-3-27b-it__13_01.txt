1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs **1** time in this fragment.

2. There are 18 total events. 1/18 = 0.05555... Rounded to two decimal places, this represents **5.56%** of all logged events.

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why estimating the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks based on this fragment is unreliable:

   *   **Small Sample Size:** The fragment contains data from only a very limited number of cases (4). This is unlikely to be representative of the entire month's activity, especially if the distribution of cases requiring manual fraud checks varies.
   *   **Temporal Bias:** The fragment represents events occurring on only one day (2025-05-01). Fraud patterns might be different on different days of the month (e.g., weekends vs. weekdays, around holidays) or change over time within the month, and this fragment wouldn’t capture those variations.
