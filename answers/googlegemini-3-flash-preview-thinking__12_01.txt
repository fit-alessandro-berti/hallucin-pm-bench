No, the fact is **inaccurate**.

The event log contradicts the claim in every instance where both activities occur:

*   **Case 1001:** "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02).
*   **Case 1003:** "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18), with the activity "Quality_Check" occurring between them.
*   **Case 1002:** Does not contain the activity "Update_Inventory," making the claim inapplicable.

In the provided data, "Authorize_Refund" never occurs before "Update_Inventory."
