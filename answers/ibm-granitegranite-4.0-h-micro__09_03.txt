Given the provided artefacts, I am unable to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity. The event-log stub only contains a header with column names (case_id, activity, lifecycle, resource, start_time, complete_time, cost_EUR) but lacks any actual data rows with timestamps or durations for the "Approve Invoice" activity. Without concrete start and complete times for this specific activity, it is not possible to perform the required calculations.
