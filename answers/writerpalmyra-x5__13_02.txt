3. Activities with very low support, like "Manual_Fraud_Check" (only 1 occurrence), can distort process models by appearing as outliers or rare paths. If overgeneralized, they may lead to incorrect assumptions about process flow, inflate complexity, or bias performance metrics (e.g., cycle time). Predictive models might overfit to rare patterns or fail to generalize, especially if such rare events are treated as representative rather than exceptional.
