1) “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs **1** time (case C05).  

2a) Event share: \(1 / 48 = 0.0208\) ⇒ **2.08%**  
2b) Case share: \(1 / 12 = 0.0833\) ⇒ **8.33%**  

3) With only one occurrence in this slice, “Manual_Fraud_Check” has scant evidence. Including it in performance or predictive analyses can skew models: a single fast/slow instance could bias activity duration estimates; path probability estimates will overfit to noise; predictive models may treat this rare step as a decisive feature despite insufficient support, harming generalisability to the wider process.
