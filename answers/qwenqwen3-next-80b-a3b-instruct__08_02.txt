No, T5 cannot fire before T3. T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. P2 is only enabled after T1 fires, but P5 requires T4, which requires P4. P4 can only be marked after either T3 (from P2) or T7 (from P3). T7 requires T2, which requires P1 from T1. Thus, to reach P5, T3 or T7 must fire first. T3 fires directly from P2 (post-T1), while T7 depends on T2 → T7. Either way, T3 or T7 must precede T4 → P5, making T5-dependent on T3 or a path including T7, not T5 preceding T3. T5 cannot fire before T3.
