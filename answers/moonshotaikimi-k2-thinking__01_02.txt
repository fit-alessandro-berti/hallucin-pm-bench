**Decision Points**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – compares the two independent risk scores; proceeds to Neighbourhood Feedback Check if the scores differ by ≤ 2 points, otherwise escalates to the Harmonisation Committee.  
2. **Amount Threshold Decision** – evaluates the requested amount; auto-approves loans < €15 000 and sends loans ≥ €15 000 to the board.  
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – the Micro-loan Board votes to approve or reject applications that reach this step.
