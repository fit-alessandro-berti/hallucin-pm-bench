1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt (CaseID 1002).  

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of "Manual Fraud Check" because this snippet includes only **3 cases** (1001–1003). If the full month’s log contains many more cases where this activity occurs, or if the snippet is from a period with unusually low manual checks (e.g., automated systems dominating), the sample would not reflect the true prevalence. Additionally, other cases might have variations in activity names (e.g., "Manual Review" vs. "Manual Fraud Check") that could skew judgments.
