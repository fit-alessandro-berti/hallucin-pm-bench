**Answer 1:** No.

**Answer 2:** T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. P5 can only be marked after T4 fires, which requires P4 to be marked. P4 can only be marked by either T3 (from P2) or T7 (via T2 from P1). Since T1 initially produces tokens in P1 and P2, P2 is available immediately, but P5 requires P4, which—without T3—depends on the P1→P3→P4 path. However, even then, T5 still needs P2 (available) *and* P5 (which needs P4). But P4 cannot be marked without either T3 or T7. If we avoid T3, we must use T7, which is possible—but T5 still fires *after* T3 or its alternative. Crucially, T3 is not required, but T5 cannot fire *before* T3 because P4 (hence P5) is unmarked until either T3 or T7 fires—both occur after T1, and T5 needs P5, so T5 always fires after T3 *or* T7, but never before T3 is *enabled*. However, the question is whether T5 can fire *before T3 fires*, not before it's enabled. Yes—if we take the T1→T2→T7→T4→T5 path, T3 never fires, so T5 fires without T3 ever occurring; thus, T5 fires “before T3” only if T3 never fires. But strictly, if T3 is eventually fired, T5 can’t precede it. However, the reachable marking where T5 fires without T3 ever firing means T5 can occur in a run where T3 doesn’t fire at all—so yes, T5 can fire without T3 having fired. Wait—rechecking: T5 needs P2 and P5. P2 is present after T1. P5 requires P4. P4 can be reached via T7 (T1→T2→T7) *or* T3. So sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. In this sequence, T3 never fires, so T5 fires before T3 (since T3 doesn’t fire at all). Thus answer is **yes**.

**Corrected Answer 1:** Yes.

**Answer 2:** Minimal sequence: **[T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]**. After T1, P2 holds a token. T2–T7–T4 produce a token in P5. Now T5 (needing P2 and P5) fires. T3 never fires, so T5 occurs before (i.e., without) T3.
