No. T5 requires tokens in P2 and P5 simultaneously. T3 consumes P2 to produce P4, which T4 then consumes to produce P5. So P5 cannot be marked unless P2 was consumed by T3 (or another transition consuming P2). Since T2→T7→T4 also leads to P5, but still requires P3 (hence P1, hence T1 firing), P2 remains untouched only if T3 doesn’t fire — but then P5 won’t get marked via P4 from P2. Thus, T5 cannot fire before T3. Any path to P5 requires T3 or consumes P2, making T5 strictly dependent on prior T3 firing.
