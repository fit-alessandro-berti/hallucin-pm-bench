Below is a complete and accurate response to your query based on Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process. I have adhered strictly to the process description provided in the system prompt.

### a) Summary of Every Decision Point
A decision point refers to any gate or conditional branch in the process. There are two such points in the process. Below, I summarize each one in a single sentence, focusing on its rule:

1. **Conditional Branch in Step 4 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome)**: If the risk rating from the Tri-Color-Risk-Check is Low or Medium and the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, then skip Step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review).  
2. **Decision Gate in Step 6 (TriVote)**: The TriVote gate approves the loan if at least two out of the three required approvals (from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) are obtained, despite the process requiring approvals from all three to be sought.

### b) List of All Documents Required in the Process
The following is a list of all documents mentioned as required anywhere in the process, presented in the order they first appear based on the sequence of steps. I have included only unique documents and noted their first occurrence for clarity:

1. **Form 14B** (First appears in Step 1: Receive-Application)  
2. **Scorecard–Cyan** (First appears in Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check, as an input)  
3. **Scorecard–Magenta** (First appears in Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check, as an input)  
4. **Scorecard–Yellow** (First appears in Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check, as an input)  
5. **Deck Memo** (First appears in Step 5: Manual-Underwriting-Review)  
6. **Offer Sheet 77** (First appears in Step 7: Prepare-Binding-Offer)  
7. **ID Matrix Declaration** (First appears in Step 8: Request-Applicant-Confirmation)  
8. **Loan Dossier 2025** (First appears in Step 9: Finalize-Agreement)  

Note: In Step 8, "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is mentioned, but it is treated as a variant of "Offer Sheet 77" (which first appears in Step 7), so it is not listed as a separate document to avoid duplication. All documents are based solely on the process description.
