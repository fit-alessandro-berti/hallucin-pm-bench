**Yes.**  
Because **pd** can be produced directly by the shortcut **T2b** (bypassing **pc** and hence **T3**), **T5** can fire without any prior firing of **T3**.

**One shortest firing sequence (length 4):**

```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```

**Marking trace:**

1. **T1**:  p0 → pa + pb  
   ⇒ pa=1, pb=1
2. **T2b**: pa → pd  
   ⇒ pd=1, pb=1
3. **T4**:  pb → pe  
   ⇒ pd=1, pe=1
4. **T5**:  pd + pe → pf  
   ⇒ T5 fires while **T3 has not fired** (pc is still 0).

This sequence is shortest because **T1** is required to create pa and pb, and both **T2b** and **T4** are needed to obtain pd and pe before **T5** can fire.
