 No, trace 2025-05-RX17 is not compliant with ruleset R.

Justification:
1. In the given trace, both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) do occur once each and in that order, so this rule is satisfied.
2. However, the case-level attribute `severity = "High"`, and `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) does not happen after both QE and RA, but before `Notify_Authorities` (NA), which violates rule 2.
3. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before both QE and RA are complete, which violates rule 3.
4. `Close_Case` (CC) may not be evaluated in this case since it occurs after a violation of rule 3, and it is not possible to determine if it would occur after `Notify_Authorities` (NA) and, if required by rule 2, after `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP).

Therefore, trace 2025-05-RX17 is not compliant with ruleset R.
