**No**  

Justification:  
1. **Rule 1 violated**: QE must occur before RA, but in the trace, QE occurs before RA (which is correct), but NA occurs before RA (which violates Rule 3).  
2. **Rule 2 satisfied**: VP occurs after both QE and RA (required for "High" severity).  
3. **Rule 3 violated**: NA occurs before RA is complete (must happen only after both QE and RA).  
4. **Rule 4 violated**: CC occurs after NA, but NA itself was premature (violating Rule 3), so CC is also non-compliant.  

Thus, the trace violates Rules 1, 3, and 4.
