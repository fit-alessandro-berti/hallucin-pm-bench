In reviewing Orion’s end-to-end loan processing data, three activities stand out as the most critical for immediate intervention based on their combined SLA breaches and elevated waiting times. Risk Review currently surpasses its 300-second target by 300 seconds, with an average waiting time of 480 seconds. Legal Approval also exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds, coupled with a lengthy 600-second waiting time. Finally, Credit Assessment overshoots its 240-second goal by 60 seconds and carries a 200-second waiting time.

Recommendations:
• Expand specialized staffing for Risk Review to address the extended 480-second wait.  
• Streamline the Legal Approval workflow by introducing an automated document validation tool to reduce the 600-second delay.  
• Implement a more rigorous upfront data-check protocol in Credit Assessment to reduce both the 60-second SLA overrun and the 200-second wait.

Addressing these factors will directly enhance throughput times and reduce loan processing bottlenecks.
