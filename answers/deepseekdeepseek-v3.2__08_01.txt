**Yes**, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.  

**Concrete firing sequence:**  
1. Fire T1: consumes token from p0, produces tokens in p1 and p2. Marking: p1=1, p2=1.  
2. Fire T2: consumes token from p1, produces token in p3. Marking: p2=1, p3=1, p4=0.  
3. Fire T5: enabled because p3≥1 and p4=0; consumes token from p3, produces token in p6. Marking: p2=1, p6=1.  

**Justification:**  
T5 requires a token in p3 and an empty p4. After T1 and T2, p3 holds a token while p4 remains empty (since T3 has not fired). Thus, T5 is enabled and can fire before T3.
