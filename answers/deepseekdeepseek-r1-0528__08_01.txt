### Answer:
Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking. Below is one concrete firing sequence from the initial marking that demonstrates this, along with a brief justification.

#### Concrete Firing Sequence:
1. **Initial marking: [p0]: 1, [p1]: 0, [p2]: 0, [p3]: 0, [p4]: 0, [p5]: 0, [p6]: 0**  
   - T1 is enabled (p0 has a token).  
   - Fire T1: Consume p0, produce p1 and p2.  
     **New marking: [p0]: 0, [p1]: 1, [p2]: 1, [p3]: 0, [p4]: 0, [p5]: 0, [p6]: 0**

2. **Current marking: [p0]: 0, [p1]: 1, [p2]: 1, [p3]: 0, [p4]: 0, [p5]: 0, [p6]: 0**  
   - T2 is enabled (p1 has a token).  
   - Fire T2: Consume p1, produce p3.  
     **New marking: [p0]: 0, [p1]: 0, [p2]: 1, [p3]: 1, [p4]: 0, [p5]: 0, [p6]: 0**

3. **Current marking: [p0]: 0, [p1]: 0, [p2]: 1, [p3]: 1, [p4]: 0, [p5]: 0, [p6]: 0**  
   - T5 is enabled because p3 has a token (normal arc) and p4 has no tokens (inhibitor arc condition satisfied).  
   - Fire T5: Consume p3, produce p6.  
     **New marking: [p0]: 0, [p1]: 0, [p2]: 1, [p3]: 0, [p4]: 0, [p5]: 0, [p6]: 1**

   **At this point, T5 has fired.**  
   - T3 is enabled (p2 has a token), but it has not yet fired.

4. **Current marking: [p0]: 0, [p1]: 0, [p2]: 1, [p3]: 0, [p4]: 0, [p5]: 0, [p6]: 1**  
   - Fire T3: Consume p2, produce p4.  
     **New marking: [p0]: 0, [p1]: 0, [p2]: 0, [p3]: 0, [p4]: 1, [p5]: 0, [p6**: 1]  
   (This step confirms T3 fires after T5, but it is not required for the question.)

**Firing sequence**: T1 → T2 → T5 → T3

#### Justification:
In this sequence:
- After firing T1 (Step 1), tokens are placed in p1 and p2.
- Firing T2 next (Step 2) produces a token in p3 while p4 remains empty (since T3, which produces p4, has not fired).
- With p3 having a token and p4 empty (0 tokens), T5 is enabled and fires in Step 3. This occurs **before** T3 fires because:
  - T3 requires a token in p2 to fire, but the inhibitor arc on T5 prevents T5 from firing if p4 has a token (which only T3 can produce).
  - By firing T2 before T3, we ensure p4 has no tokens, allowing T5 to fire first.

This sequence is reachable because the net is safe (no place ever holds more than one token), and the order of transition firings allows non-synchronized paths (e.g., T2 can fire independently of T3 after T1). Therefore, T5 can fire before T3.
