Let me help you answer each question:

Q1: There are **3** distinct cases in this fragment (C001, C002, and C003)

Q2: For case "C002", the sequence of activities is:
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

Q3: Activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

(Found by checking what activity comes right before "Ship_Order" in each case: C001 had Check_Stock→Ship_Order, C002 had Arrange_Delivery→Ship_Order, and C003 had Check_Stock→Ship_Order)
