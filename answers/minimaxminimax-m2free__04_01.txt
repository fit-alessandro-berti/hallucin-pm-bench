We need to evaluate compliance with each rule.

First, we need to understand the rules precisely:

Rule set P2P-2025.R1

1. Any purchase order (PO) whose total amount exceeds €10,000 must obtain two approvals, first by a Procurement Officer and then by the CFO, before activity Issue_PO.

2. If the trace contains activity Expedite_Flag,
   - activity Quality_Check becomes optional but
   - activity Risk_Assessment must occur before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods.

3. After Goods_Received, activity Three_way_match must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2).

4. No activity executed by the role Intern may directly follow an activity executed by the role CFO.

5. The trace must finish with Archive_Record and contain nothing after it.

Now, we need to examine the trace.

Given trace ID 24-EXP:

Event order:

1. Create_Requisition (Employee)
2. Approve_PO (Procurement_Officer)
3. Approve_PO_CFO (CFO)
4. Expedite_Flag (System)
5. Issue_PO (System)
6. Goods_Received (Warehouse_Clerk)
7. Move_to_Quality (Intern)
8. Ship_Goods (Logistics)
9. Risk_Assessment (Risk_Manager)
10. Three_way_match (Accounting)
11. Archive_Record (System)

Check each rule.

Rule 1: PO_Amount = €12,300 > €10k, so need two approvals: first Procurement Officer, then CFO, before Issue_PO. In trace:

- Approve_PO (Procurement_Officer) at #2.
- Approve_PO_CFO (CFO) at #3.
- Issue_PO at #5 (but there is an intervening activity Expedite_Flag at #4). However, rule says approvals must be before activity Issue_PO, not necessarily consecutively. It only says before Issue_PO. So as long as approvals happen before Issue_PO, which they do. So rule satisfied.

Check ordering: Procurement Officer then CFO. Yes, #2 is Procurement Officer, #3 CFO. So rule satisfied.

Rule 2: If the trace contains activity Expedite_Flag (yes at #4). Then:

- Quality_Check becomes optional. The trace does not contain Quality_Check activity. That's allowed because it's optional.

- Risk_Assessment must occur before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods. Let's see: Ship_Goods occurs at #8. Risk_Assessment occurs at #9, which is after Ship_Goods. So risk assessment occurs after ship goods, not before. That violates the rule. The rule says "activity Risk_Assessment must occur before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods". The first occurrence of Ship_Goods is #8. Risk_Assessment at #9 is after. So rule 2 is violated.

Thus the trace is non-compliant.

But we need to verify if any other rule also fails, but one violation is enough to be non-compliant. However, we might need to check all.

Rule 3: After Goods_Received, activity Three_way_match must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). Goods_Received at #6. The next two activities after #6 are #7 and #8 (Move_to_Quality, Ship_Goods). The three-way match occurs at #10, which is the 4th activity after #6. That distance is 4 > 2, so rule 3 is also violated. However, check if "distance ≤ 2" means count of activities between? The rule says "within the next two activities". Usually means within the next two activities, i.e., the three-way match must be the 1st or 2nd activity after Goods_Received. So #10 is too far. So rule 3 is also violated.

But note: The trace includes a Move_to_Quality (Intern) after Goods_Received, but the rule 2 says if Expedite_Flag present, Quality_Check becomes optional. There's no Quality_Check at all. That's okay.

Now check rule 4: No activity executed by role Intern may directly follow an activity executed by role CFO. In trace: CFO activity is Approve_PO_CFO at #3. The next activity #4 is Expedite_Flag (System). Then #5 Issue_PO (System). Then #6 Goods_Received (Warehouse_Clerk). Then #7 Move_to_Quality (Intern). So the activity after CFO is not Intern; there's a gap of multiple activities. So rule 4 satisfied.

But we need to consider if there is any Intern directly after CFO anywhere else. CFO appears only at #3; after #3 there is no Intern at #4, so fine.

Rule 5: The trace must finish with Archive_Record and contain nothing after it. Indeed, final activity #11 is Archive_Record, and there is no later activity. So rule 5 satisfied.

Thus the trace is non-compliant due to violations of rule 2 and rule 3. The question expects "Non-compliant" with justification citing relevant rules.

Thus answer: Non-compliant.

We need to provide numbered justification that cites the relevant rules.

Probably format:

Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 violation: Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods, but must be before.
2. Rule 3 violation: Three_way_match too far after Goods_Received.
3. Rule 1 satisfied, rule 4 satisfied, rule 5 satisfied.

We can also mention that rule 2's condition "Quality_Check optional" is not an issue because it's optional.

Thus final answer.

Now we need to provide final answer in the requested format: "Compliant" or "Non-compliant", followed by a numbered justification that cites the relevant rules.

Thus final answer:

Non-compliant

1. Rule 2: The trace contains Expedite_Flag (activity #4). Consequently, Risk_Assessment must occur before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods. However, Risk_Assessment occurs at #9, whereas Ship_Goods occurs at #8. Therefore the required ordering is violated.

2. Rule 3: After Goods_Received (activity #6), Three_way_match must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). In the trace, the activities following Goods_Received are Move_to_Quality (#7) and Ship_Goods (#8), and Three_way_match only appears at #10, which is four positions later, exceeding the allowed distance.

(Optionally mention that Rule 1, Rule 4, and Rule 5 are satisfied.)

Thus final answer.

**Non‑compliant**

1. **Rule 2** – The trace contains the activity *Expedite_Flag* (event #4). Therefore, *Risk_Assessment* must occur **before** the first *Ship_Goods*. In the log, *Ship_Goods* is at event #8 and *Risk_Assessment* only appears at event #9, violating the required ordering.

2. **Rule 3** – After *Goods_Received* (event #6), *Three_way_match* must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The two activities following *Goods_Received* are *Move_to_Quality* (#7) and *Ship_Goods* (#8); *Three_way_match* only occurs at event #10, which is four positions later, exceeding the allowed distance.

(For completeness: Rule 1 is satisfied (two approvals before *Issue_PO*), Rule 4 is satisfied (no Intern directly follows CFO), and Rule 5 is satisfied (trace ends with *Archive_Record*).)
