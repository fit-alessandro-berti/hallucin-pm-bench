1. No.

2. Evidence from the log:

• Case C001: Receive_Order ➜ Validate_Payment ➜ Pack_Items  
  (Validate_Payment is immediately after Receive_Order.)

• Case C002: Receive_Order ➜ Pack_Items ➜ Validate_Payment  
  (Pack_Items occurs between the two activities – violates the claim.)

• Case C003: Receive_Order ➜ Validate_Payment ➜ Ship_Order  
  (Validate_Payment is immediately after Receive_Order.)

• Case C004: Receive_Order ➜ Check_Fraud ➜ Validate_Payment ➜ Pack_Items  
  (Check_Fraud occurs between the two activities – violates the claim.)

Because Cases C002 and C004 contain an intervening activity, the statement that “Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order” is incorrect.
