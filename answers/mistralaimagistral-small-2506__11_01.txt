**Memo for COO: Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time**

The three activities with the longest waiting timesâ€”**Request_Documents (#1), Send_Closure_Letter (#2), and Assess_Liability (#3)**â€”are causing significant delays. Their average / 95th-percentile waiting times are:

1. **Request_Documents**: Avg = 36.5h, 95p = 120.0h â†’ **Action**: Automate document requests via an integrated portal to cut waiting time by 20%+.
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg = 12.2h, 95p = 44.0h â†’ **Action**: Switch to email/instant notifications (A/B tested without claims of fraud).
3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg = 7.8h, 95p = 16.4h â†’ **Action**: Outsource non-complex cases or use rule-based auto-validation for speed.

Next steps: Approve the actions for pilot testing in Q2.
