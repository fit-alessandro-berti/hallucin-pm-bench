Let’s go through the questions one by one:

---

**Q1: How many *distinct cases* are present in this fragment?**

We look at the `case` attribute in all event lines.

Relevant lines:

- Line 1: `C001`
- Line 2: `C002`
- Line 3: `C001`
- Line 4: `C003`
- Line 5: `C002`
- Line 6: `C003`
- Line 7: `C001`
- Line 8: `C002`
- Line 9: `C003`
- Line 10: `C002`

Distinct cases: `C001`, `C002`, `C003`  
✅ **Answer: 3**

---

**Q2: For case “C002”, list the *sequence of activities* in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

For `C002`, we filter events:

- Line 2: `Receive_Order`
- Line 5: `Check_Stock`
- Line 8: `Arrange_Delivery`
- Line 10: `Ship_Order`

Order by timestamp:

1. `Receive_Order`
2. `Check_Stock`
3. `Arrange_Delivery`
4. `Ship_Order`

✅ **Answer: `Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`**

---

**Q3: Across all cases, list every *distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”* (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**

We find all events where the next event in the *same case* is `Ship_Order`.

From the data:

- **C001:**
  - `Receive_Order` → `Check_Stock` → `Ship_Order`  
    ✅ `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order`

- **C002:**
  - `Receive_Order` → `Check_Stock` → `Arrange_Delivery` → `Ship_Order`  
    ✅ `Arrange_Delivery` precedes `Ship_Order`

- **C003:**
  - `Receive_Order` → `Check_Stock` → `Ship_Order`  
    ✅ `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order`

Unique preceding activities: `Check_Stock`, `Arrange_Delivery`

Alphabetically ordered:

✅ **Answer:**
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
