I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval because the event log only contains a header row with column names; no actual timestamps or activity durations are provided. Without the raw data—specifically, the start and end times for each “Approve Invoice” activity—these metrics are mathematically indeterminate from the artefacts available.
