The fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment provided. 

Justification: 

Upon reviewing the event-log fragment, we observe the following sequence of activities for each case:

- Case 1001: The sequence is Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued.
- Case 1002: The sequence is Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued.
- Case 1003: The sequence is Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund.

In none of the cases does "Authorize_Refund" occur immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case. Therefore, the claim that "In GalaxyRetail’s returns process, the activity 'Authorize_Refund' always occurs immediately before 'Update_Inventory' within the same case" is incorrect based on the given data.
