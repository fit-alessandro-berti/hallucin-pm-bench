1. Average cycle time of “Approve Invoice”
   The exact average cannot be computed because the event log contains no actual timestamps or durations for the “Approve Invoice” activity (all rows and timestamp values are redacted).

2. Standard deviation and 95 % confidence interval
   Neither the standard deviation nor the confidence interval can be calculated for the same reason: the log provides no observed durations from which to derive variance or sample statistics.

3. Why the metrics are unobtainable
   Artefact A is a header-only stub; every row and every timestamp value has been removed. Without at least one observed start_time and complete_time for “Approve Invoice,” no empirical duration can be measured, making all requested statistics impossible to compute.
