1. The average cycle time of activity “Approve Invoice” in the supplied log cannot be computed.

2. For the same reason, the standard deviation and a 95 % confidence interval for the “Approve Invoice” cycle time also cannot be computed.

3. The event-log stub contains only the column headers and no actual rows or timestamps; all data values have been removed. To compute the cycle time of “Approve Invoice,” we would need at least the start_time and complete_time for each occurrence of that activity in the log. Without any concrete timestamp data (or even a single case), no duration values can be derived, so averages, standard deviations, and confidence intervals are mathematically impossible to calculate from the provided artefacts.
