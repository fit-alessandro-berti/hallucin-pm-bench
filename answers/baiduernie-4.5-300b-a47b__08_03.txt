Let's analyze the possible firing sequences based on the Petri - net structure and the initial marking.

### Initial situation
We start with the initial marking $M_0=\{p0 = 1, \text{all other }p = 0\}$. The only enabled transition at the start is $T1$ since its input place $p0$ has a token.

### Transition enabling rules
A transition is enabled if and only if all of its input places have at least one token. When a transition fires, it consumes one token from each of its input places and deposits one token in each of its output places.

### Case 1: Analyze the paths after $T1$ fires
When $T1$ fires, it consumes the token from $p0$ and produces tokens in $pa$ and $pb$. So the new marking $M_1=\{pa = 1,pb = 1\}$.

Now, transitions $T2$, $T2b$, and $T4$ are enabled.

#### Option 1: If $T2$ fires
If $T2$ fires first (after $T1$), it consumes the token from $pa$ and produces a token in $pc$. The marking becomes $M_{2a}=\{pb = 1,pc = 1\}$.
- After this, $T4$ can still fire (since $pb$ has a token). If $T4$ fires,  $M_{3a}=\{pe = 1,pc = 1\}$. At this point, $T5$ is not enabled because its input place $pd$ has no tokens. We still need $T3$ to fire to produce a token in $pd$. So $T5$ cannot fire before $T3$ in this path.

#### Option 2: If $T2b$ fires
If $T2b$ fires first (after $T1$), it consumes the token from $pa$ and produces a token in $pd$. The marking becomes $M_{2b}=\{pb = 1,pd = 1\}$.
- Then, $T4$ can fire. When $T4$ fires, it consumes the token from $pb$ and produces a token in $pe$. The marking becomes $M_{3b}=\{pd = 1,pe = 1\}$.
- Since $T5$ has input places $pd$ and $pe$, it is now enabled. And at no point before this did we need $T3$ to fire.

### The shortest firing sequence
The shortest firing sequence in which $T5$ fires before $T3$ is $T1,T2b,T4,T5$.

1. **Initial firing**: $T1$ fires because $p0$ is marked. After $T1$ fires, $pa$ and $pb$ get tokens.
2. **Shortcut firing**: $T2b$ fires because $pa$ is marked. After $T2b$ fires, $pd$ gets a token.
3. **Parallel path firing**: $T4$ fires because $pb$ is marked. After $T4$ fires, $pe$ gets a token.
4. **Synchronization**: $T5$ fires because both $pd$ and $pe$ are marked.


So, the answer is yes. One shortest firing sequence is $T1,T2b,T4,T5$.
