**Memo to the COOSubject**: Addressing Worst-Performing Activities to Improve SLA Compliance

Based on the latest process data, the following activities require immediate attention due to their combined high waiting times and significant SLA breaches:

- **Risk Review**:
	- Exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (100% over target).
	- Recommendation: **Increase team capacity or automate initial checks to reduce bottlenecks.**
- **Credit Assessment**:
	- Exceeds SLA by 160 seconds (67% over target).
	- Recommendation: **Streamline documentation requirements to accelerate processing.**
- **Legal Approval**:
	- Exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (50% over target).
	- Recommendation: **Introduce parallel reviews for simpler cases to reduce backlog.**

These measures address systemic delays and align process performance with customer expectations and SLA targets.
