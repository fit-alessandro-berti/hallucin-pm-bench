1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time in this fragment.

2. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" represents 5.56% of all logged events. (1 / 18 * 100)

3. The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is A1002.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable are:
    *   **Small Sample Size:** The log fragment contains data for only one day and a limited number of cases. This is an extremely small sample to extrapolate monthly frequencies from.
    *   **Lack of Representativeness:** The fragment may not represent typical operational patterns. For instance, this specific day might have had an unusually high or low number of manual fraud checks due to external factors not captured in the log. Additionally, the fragment does not provide information about other days of the month, weekends, holidays, or different business periods, which could significantly impact fraud check occurrences.
