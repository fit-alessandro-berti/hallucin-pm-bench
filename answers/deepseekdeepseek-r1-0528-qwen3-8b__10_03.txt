To produce the RACI matrix, I strictly adhered to the authorized vocabulary: using "Intake Vetting" for the preliminary assessment, "KYC Review" for customer due diligence, "AML Screening" for the sanctions check, and "Risk Scoring" for the risk rating derivation. The RACI matrix is based on the roles and process narrative provided, with entries inferred from standard business practices where not explicitly stated.
