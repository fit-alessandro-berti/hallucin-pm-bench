Here’s the **single SLA-compliance improvement** with a unified diff and rationale:

```

### **2. Rationale**
**Shorten the `Grant System Access` SLA from 1 day to 2 hours** to eliminate the process bottleneck, as this external task (often automated) is the last step before the employee can start work—its delay directly impacts onboarding completion time.

**Key Insight**:
The current `P1D` SLA for `Grant System Access` is disproportionately long compared to other tasks (e.g., `Sign Contract` at `P3D`). Since this is an **external/system task**, it can typically be executed in minutes/hours (e.g., via API calls or automated provisioning). Reducing it to `PT2H` (2 hours) aligns with realistic technical capabilities and accelerates the overall process without adding/removing activities.
