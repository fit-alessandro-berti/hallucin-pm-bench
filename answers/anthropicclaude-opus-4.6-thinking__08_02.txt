## Answer

**Question 1: Yes**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Question 2 — Minimal firing sequence:**

**T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5**

**Trace walkthrough:**

| Step | Fire | Marking (non-zero places) |
|------|------|--------------------------|
| 0 | — | P0 |
| 1 | T1 | P1, P2 |
| 2 | T2 | P2, P3 |
| 3 | T7 | P2, P4 |
| 4 | T4 | P2, P5 |
| 5 | T5 | P6 |

**Why it works:** T1 AND-splits into P1 and P2. The upper branch T2→T7 produces a token in P4 (without consuming P2), and T4 moves it to P5. Now both P2 and P5 are marked, satisfying T5's input requirements — all without ever firing T3. T3 is simply never needed because T7 provided an alternative path to P4.
