Below is a summary of all changes between BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2 for Acme Bank's Loan_Process, based on a meticulous comparison of the BPMN XML structures. I have strictly adhered to the requested headings, focusing only on structural changes (e.g., added or removed tasks, and gateway type modifications). Cosmetic changes, such as task name updates or XML line reordering, have been ignored.

### Added tasks
- Task_VerifyIdentity  
- Task_RequestDocs  
- Task_FinalReject  

### Removed tasks
- Task_RejectLoan  

### Gateway-type changes
