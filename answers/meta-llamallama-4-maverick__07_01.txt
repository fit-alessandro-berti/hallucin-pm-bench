To determine the factual differences between the two BPMN XML snippets that represent the two versions of the *Return-Merchandise-Authorization (RMA) process*, let's analyze them step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the elements in both versions
First, we identify the tasks, gateways, and other elements in both BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2.

### BPMN_v1 Elements:
- Tasks: receive_request, validate_warranty, approve_return, send_rma_label, reject_return
- Gateways: gw_valid (exclusiveGateway)
- StartEvent: start
- EndEvent: end

### BPMN_v2 Elements:
- Tasks: receive_request, check_vip, validate_warranty, approve_return, generate_qr, reject_return
- Gateways: gw_valid (inclusiveGateway)
- StartEvent: start
- EndEvent: end

### Step 2: Compare the elements between the two versions

#### Tasks Comparison
- **Added tasks**: Compare the tasks in BPMN_v2 to those in BPMN_v1 to identify any new tasks.
  - BPMN_v2 has "check_vip" and "generate_qr" which are not in BPMN_v1.
  - BPMN_v1 has "send_rma_label" which is not in BPMN_v2.
  
- **Removed tasks**: Identify tasks present in BPMN_v1 but not in BPMN_v2.
  - "send_rma_label" is in BPMN_v1 but not in BPMN_v2.

#### Gateways Comparison
- **Gateway type changes**: Compare the gateway types in both versions.
  - In BPMN_v1, "gw_valid" is an exclusiveGateway.
  - In BPMN_v2, "gw_valid" is an inclusiveGateway.

### Step 3: Summarize the changes under the required headings

• **Added tasks**
  - task id="check_vip"
  - task id="generate_qr"

• **Removed tasks**
  - task id="send_rma_label"

• **Gateway type changes**
  - gw_valid changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway
