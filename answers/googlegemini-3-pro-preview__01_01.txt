Based on the process description provided for Contoso Airlines, here is the summary of the decision points and the list of required documents.

### Decision Points

There is **one** explicit branching decision point defined in this process:

*   **High-Value Assessment:** The process evaluates if the refund amount is **greater than €1,000**.
    *   **If Yes:** The case is routed to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (which must occur before the payment process).
    *   **If No:** The process skips the Senior Auditor review and proceeds to **Process_Refund_Payment** (once Finance Controller pre-approval is complete).
