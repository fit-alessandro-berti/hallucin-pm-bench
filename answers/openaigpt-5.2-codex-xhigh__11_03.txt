COO, analysis of average throughput versus target SLA and waiting time highlights three activities that jointly show the largest SLA breaches and high waiting. Risk Review averages 600s throughput against a 300s SLA, exceeding by 300s, and has 480s average waiting across 480 cases. Legal Approval averages 900s throughput against a 600s SLA, exceeding by 300s, and has 600s waiting across 465 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s throughput against a 240s SLA, exceeding by 60s, and has 200s waiting across 1175 cases. These steps concentrate the largest SLA overruns and waiting times in the process.

- Reallocate Risk Review capacity to reduce the 480s average waiting time and close the 300s SLA gap.
- Increase Legal Approval capacity to cut its 600s waiting time and bring the 900s average closer to the 600s SLA.
- Prioritize Credit Assessment in the queue to reduce its 200s waiting time and close the 60s SLA overrun.
