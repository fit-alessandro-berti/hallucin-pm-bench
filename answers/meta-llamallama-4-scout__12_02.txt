No.

The fact that "Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order" is not accurate. In case C003, Validate_Payment (line 6) occurs before Receive_Order (line 7). This is a clear counterexample to the claimed fact. Additionally, cases C001, C002, C004, and C005 do follow the order, but a single counterexample is enough to declare the fact inaccurate. Therefore, based on the provided log fragment, the fact is not verified.
