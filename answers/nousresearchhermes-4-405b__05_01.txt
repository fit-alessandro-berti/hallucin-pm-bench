To enforce the 48-hour SLA for reaching "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage) without adding new activities, add an intermediate timer event attached to the "Claim Submitted" start event (Start_Claim). Set the timer to 48 hours. Connect this timer event (e.g., id="Timer_Escalate") via a new sequence flow to the "Task_Triage" activity. This way, if the normal path doesn't reach "Triage Claim" within the SLA, the timer triggers and auto-escalates the claim by bypassing intermediate steps like "Check Completeness" (Task_Check) and "Request Missing Docs" (Task_RequestDocs), ensuring the SLA is met without extra tasks.
