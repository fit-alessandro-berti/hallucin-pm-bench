# EXECUTIVE MEMO: CLAIMS HANDLING PERFORMANCE Q1-2025

## Three Critical Underperforming Activities

**1. Request_Documents**
* Highest wait time (150 minutes) creates significant process delays
* Exceptionally high rework rate (22%) indicates repeated document requests
* 5.5% SLA breach rate affects customer satisfaction
* **Recommendation**: Implement standardized document checklists with automated initial completeness validation to reduce rework and waiting time

**2. Review_Documents**
* Highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) directly impacts customer experience
* Longest processing time (25 minutes) with highest variability (9 minutes)
* 5.3% rework rate suggests quality issues
* **Recommendation**: Develop structured review protocols and targeted training program to address processing inconsistency and reduce breaches

**3. Initial_Assessment**
* Third-highest wait time (18 minutes) causes early process bottlenecks
* Second-longest processing time (12 minutes) with notable variability
* Acts as a constraint on overall throughput
* **Recommendation**: Add assessment capacity during peak periods and implement decision-support tools to standardize evaluations

These improvements would address the most significant performance gaps in our claims handling process, potentially reducing cycle time by 30% and improving customer satisfaction.
