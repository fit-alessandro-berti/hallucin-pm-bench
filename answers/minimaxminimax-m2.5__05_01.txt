Add a parallel branch after the start event. Insert a parallel gateway (id = “GW_Parallel”) immediately after Start_Claim. Route the existing flow through f1 as usual, and add a new flow from GW_Parallel to an intermediate timer event (id = “Timer_48h”) set to fire after PT48H. Connect Timer_48h to Task_Triage (id = “Task_Triage”) so that if the claim has not reached Triage within 48 hours the timer automatically moves the case to Triage, satisfying the SLA. Optionally route Timer_48h to an escalation end event to signal auto‑escalation.
