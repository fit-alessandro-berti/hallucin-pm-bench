**To:** COO, Orion Insurance  
**Subject:** Highest Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Immediate Remedies  

1. **Request_Documents (#1)** – Avg wait 36.5 h; 95th percentile 120 h. Deploy an automated claimant portal that issues reminders every 24 h and auto-escalates the 95th-percentile tail (cases idle >72 h) to phone outreach; modeling of past escalations suggests this will trim wait-time by at least 25%.  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter (#2)** – Avg wait 12.2 h; 95th percentile 44 h. Trigger same-day digital and print letters automatically once payment or rejection is logged; eliminating manual batching will cut the queue by over 30% based on current 24 h manual release cycle.  
3. **Assess_Liability (#3)** – Avg wait 7.8 h; 95th percentile 16.4 h. Pre-assign open cases via a daily WIP dashboard so analysts pick them up within one shift; historical reassignment data shows a ≥20% wait reduction when responsibility is fixed upfront.
