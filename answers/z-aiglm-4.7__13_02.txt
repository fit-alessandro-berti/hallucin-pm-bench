1. **1 time**

2.  
   a) **2.08%**  
   b) **8.33%**

3. Generalising from a low-support activity creates statistically unreliable conclusions. A single occurrence cannot accurately represent typical performance (e.g., cycle time) or the true frequency of that path. Predictive models may overfit to this outlier or treat it as noise, while process managers might incorrectly allocate resources based on skewed frequency estimates (assuming 8.33% of cases require manual checks). Consequently, decisions reflect random variance rather than actual process trends.
