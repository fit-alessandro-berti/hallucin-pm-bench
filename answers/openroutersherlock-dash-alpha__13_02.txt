1. **Manual_Fraud_Check** occurs **1 time** (only in C05).

2. a) **2.08%** of all events (1/48 × 100 = 2.08%)  
   b) **8.33%** of all unique cases (1/12 × 100 = 8.33%)

3. Low-support activities like Manual_Fraud_Check (1/48 events) mislead analyses by overemphasizing rare variants. Generalizing from this slice inflates their perceived frequency/impact on performance metrics (e.g., cycle time) or predictions (e.g., fraud risk), causing overfitting to outliers rather than capturing dominant "Submit→Screen→Auto→Approve/Reject" paths (47/48 events).
