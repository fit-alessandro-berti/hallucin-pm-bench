**No**

- **Rule 1:** Satisfied – `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs once, `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occurs once, and QE appears before RA.  
- **Rule 2:** Satisfied – with `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3:** **Violated** – `Notify_Authorities` is executed **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is completed, which is not allowed.  
- **Rule 4:** Satisfied – `Close_Case` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` (and after VP).  

Because Rule 3 is breached, the trace is not compliant with ruleset R.
