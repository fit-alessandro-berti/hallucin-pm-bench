The claim is **not accurate** based on the event-log fragment.

In case **1001**, "Update_Inventory" occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund":
- Case 1001:
  1. Receive_Return
  2. Inspect_Item
  3. **Update_Inventory** (before "Authorize_Refund")
  4. Authorize_Refund
  5. Refund_Issued

This directly contradicts the claim that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory".

In case **1003**, "Update_Inventory" also happens **before** "Authorize_Refund":
- Case 1003:
  1. Receive_Return
  2. Inspect_Item
  3. **Update_Inventory**
  4. Quality_Check
  5. Authorize_Refund

Case **1002** is the only instance where "Authorize_Refund" precedes "Update_Inventory" (though "Update_Inventory" is missing entirely in this case, so invalid for comparison).

Thus, the claim is false. The data '@Case 1001 and 1003@' show that **"Update_Inventory"** can occur **before** "Authorize_Refund" in the same case.
