**Re:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Top 3 Bottlenecks & Actions

**Key Findings:**
Three activities demand urgent attention:

1. **Request_Documents**
   - *Why?* Extremely high **rework rate (22%)** and **wait time (150 min)**—likely due to unclear requirements or missing submissions. The **throughput drop (190 vs. 270 upstream)** signals a choke point.
   - *Action:* Implement **pre-submission document checklists** (automated via portal) to reduce rework. Pilot with 10% of claims to validate impact on wait times.

2. **Review_Documents**
   - *Why?* Highest **processing variability (9 min stdev)** and **SLA breaches (12.4%)**, with **5.3% rework**. Complexity or inconsistent reviewer standards likely drive delays.
   - *Action:* Introduce **tiered review thresholds** (e.g., simple claims fast-tracked) and mandatory **15-min timeboxed pre-reviews** to reduce variability.

3. **Initial_Assessment**
   - *Why?* Second-highest **rework (1.8%)** and **wait time (18 min)**, with **3.2% SLA breaches**. Likely caused by ambiguous assessment criteria or handoff delays.
   - *Action:* Deploy **real-time queue alerts** when wait times exceed 10 min, paired with a **decision-tree tool** to standardize assessments.

**Note:** *Approve_Claim* and *Pay_Claim* perform well; focus improvements upstream. Data suggests **document-related activities** are the primary drag on cycle time.

**Next Steps:** Propose 30-day sprints for each action, with weekly throughput/SLA tracking.
