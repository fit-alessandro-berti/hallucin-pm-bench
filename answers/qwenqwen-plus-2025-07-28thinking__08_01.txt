### Answer:  
**Yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

### **Concrete Firing Sequence**  
Starting from the **initial marking**:  
`[p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0]`  

1. **Fire T1**:  
   - **Input**: `p0` (token consumed).  
   - **Output**: Tokens added to `p1` and `p2`.  
   - **New marking**: `[p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0]`  

2. **Fire T2**:  
   - **Input**: `p1` (token consumed).  
   - **Output**: Token added to `p3`.  
   - **New marking**: `[p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0]`  

3. **Fire T5**:  
   - **Conditions**:  
     - Normal input: `p3=1` (satisfied).  
     - **Inhibitor arc**: `p4=0` (satisfied, since T3 has **not** fired yet).  
   - **Input**: `p3` (token consumed).  
   - **Output**: Token added to `p6`.  
   - **New marking**: `[p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=1]`  

**Sequence**: `T1 → T2 → T5`  

---

### **Justification**  
- After `T1` fires, both `T2` and `T3` are enabled.  
- By firing `T2` **before** `T3`, we place a token in `p3` **without activating `p4`** (since `T3` has not fired).  
- At this point:  
  - `p3=1` (enabling T5’s normal input),  
  - `p4=0` (satisfying the inhibitor arc condition for T5).  
- Thus, **T5 is enabled and can fire** while `T3` remains unfired.  
- This explicitly demonstrates that **T5 can fire before T3**.

### Key Insight  
The **inhibitor arc** on `T5` (from `p4`) only requires `p4` to be empty at the moment of firing. Since `T3` (which feeds `p4`) has not fired yet in this sequence, the inhibitor condition is satisfied, enabling T5. This scenario is valid due to the **concurrent enabling** of `T2` and `T3` after `T1` fires, allowing a choice in transition execution order.  

✅ **Conclusion**: T5 **can** fire before T3.
