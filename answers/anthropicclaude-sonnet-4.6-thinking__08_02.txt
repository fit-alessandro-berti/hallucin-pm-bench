## Answer

**Question 1 — Yes**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Question 2 — Minimal firing sequence:** `T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5`

**Trace:**

| Step | Fires | P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 | P6 |
|------|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|
| M0   | —     |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| M1   | T1    |  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| M2   | T2    |  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| M3   | T7    |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |
| M4   | T4    |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
| M5   | **T5**|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |

The alternate path **T2 → T7** routes the token to P4/P5 *while P2 is still held*, satisfying T5's synchronisation condition **without ever consuming P2 via T3**.
