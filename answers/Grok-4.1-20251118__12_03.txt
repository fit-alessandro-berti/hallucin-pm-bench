No.

The FACT is not accurate, because there are cases where “Validate_Payment” does **not** occur immediately after “Receive_Order” (i.e., at least one other activity happens in between).

Evidence from the log:

- **Case C002**  
  Sequence: Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05)  
  → “Pack_Items” occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.

- **Case C004**  
  Sequence: Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20)  
  → “Check_Fraud” occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.

In the other two cases (C001 and C003), Validate_Payment does follow Receive_Order directly, but the presence of counterexamples in C002 and C004 is sufficient to make the universal claim (“always … with no other activities in between”) false.
