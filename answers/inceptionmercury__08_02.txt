**Question 1:** No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Question 2:** T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. T3 fires from P2 to P4, which is necessary for P5 to be enabled (since T4 fires from P4 to P5). Without T3 firing first, P5 will not have tokens, preventing T5 from firing. Therefore, no sequence exists where T5 fires before T3.
