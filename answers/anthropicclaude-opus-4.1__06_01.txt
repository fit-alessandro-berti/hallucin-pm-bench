Looking at Process B (Manufacturing_WorkOrder), I need to identify all pairs of tasks that can execute in parallel according to the description.

From the process description:
- **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** can run simultaneously (after Create_Work_Order)
- **Quality_Check** and **Create_Documentation** begin in parallel (after Fabricate)

These are the only pairs explicitly stated to run in parallel in Process B.

Here are the pairs in alphabetical order:

`Create_Documentation — Quality_Check`
`Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines`
