**Case #47291 Compliance Analysis**

1. R1. **Violated** - Event trace shows `Create_PO` amount = €12,450 > €10,000 with `Manager_Approval` followed by `Finance_Approval` requirements met.
   *Actually, the R1 rule is NOT violated because the Manager_Approval and Finance_Approval follow each other with the correct sequence after exceeding €10,000 PO amount.*

2. R2. **Violated** - `Ship_Goods` occurs after `last required approval` (Finance_Approval on 2025-03-04 08:17) on the 3rd calendar day after.
   *Since `Ship_Goods` occurs on 2025-03-07 (three days after Finance_Approval) at 10:26, it violates R2.*

3. R3. **Violated** - `Pay_Invoice` occurs before `Receive_Goods`.
   *Pay_Invoice occurs at 09:00 (2025-03-06), and Receive_Goods occurs at 14:13 (2025-03-07).*

4. R4. **Not Applicable** - `hazardous` is false, so `Safety_Inspection` is unnecessary.

5. R5. **Compliant** - No `new Manager_Approval` required after `Change_Request` and processing steps maintain valid sequence.

6. R6. **Compliant** - Case ends with `Archive_Record`.

**Conclusion:** **NON-COMPLIANT** (R2 and R3 are violated)
