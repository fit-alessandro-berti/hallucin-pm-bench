We analyze the trace against the five rules of P2P-2025.R1:

1. **PO over €10,000**: Triggered (PO Amount = €12,300). Requires two approvals: approved by Procurement Officer → then CFO. Here both approvals are present at Activities 2 and 3, so compliance on this point.

2. **Expedite_Flag presence**: Activity Expedite_Flag exists (at 8).  
   - Quality_Check must be optional → OK, since it’s not mandatory.  
   - Risk_Assessment must occur before Ship_Goods → It is at 7 and Ship_Goods is at 8, with a distance of 1 (≤2), so compliance confirmed.

3. **Three_way_match within two activities**: After Goods_Received (Activity 6), Three_way_match occurs at Activity 9. The allowed window is next two activities, which it is (10 and 11). Compliance confirmed.

4. **Intern activity cannot follow CFO**: Intern (Activity 7) > CFO (Activity 8). No direct following as required. Compliance.

5. **Trace ends with Archive_Record**: Present and no blockers. Compliance.

All rules are satisfied.

Answer: Compliant
