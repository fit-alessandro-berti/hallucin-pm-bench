### Step-by-step reasoning:

Initially, the marking is:
```
p0 = 1
pa, pb, pc, pd, pe, pf = 0
```

Let's analyze how T5 (transition T5 needs tokens in places `pd` **and** `pe`) can get enabled before T3 (transition T3 needs a token in place `pc`):

- Initially enabled: Only T1 can fire (requires a token in place `p0`).
- After firing **T1**, tokens appear in `pa` and `pb`, and `p0` token disappears.
  ```
  After T1:
  pa = 1, pb = 1
  p0, pc, pd, pe, pf = 0
  ```

- We have two choices (`T2` or `T2b`) for the token in place `pa`. Note carefully:
  - **T2** moves token from `pa` → `pc`
  - **T2b** moves token from `pa` → `pd` directly (thus skipping `pc`)

Since we want to enable **T5** before **T3**, let's carefully reason on what we need:

- Transition **T3** requires a token in `pc` (so firing it would mean we already have token in `pc`).
- To fire T5 earlier (i.e., before T3), we must first ensure T5 is enabled with tokens at both `pd` and `pe`. Let's try if that's achievable quickly without ever firing T3.

### Quick check:

- To enable T5 (input: `pd`, `pe`) we must get:
  - Token in **place `pd`**: Use **T2b** (from `pa`) → `pd`
  - Token in **place `pe`**: Use **T4** (from `pb`) → `pe`.
- Notice we don't need to fire **T2** or **T3** at this stage.

Check this clearly again step-by-step:

| Action | Marking after firing           | Enabled Transitions |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| INIT   | p0=1                          | T1                  |
| **T1** | pa=1, pb=1                    | T2, T2b, T4         |
| **T2b**| pd=1, pb=1                    | T4 (pd ready, need pe for T5) |
| **T4** | pd=1, pe=1                    | **T5 enabled**, T5 ready now |

At this point, T5 can fire **before** we've even introduced a token into `pc`, meaning before T3 has a chance to fire.

- Observe:
  - After T1, we fired T2b and T4 only.
  - **T3 never fired**, indeed it's not even possible yet since `pc` has no token.
  - Clearly, from marking above (`pd=1, pe=1`), **T5** is enabled and can now immediately fire.

### Conclusion:

**YES**. It is possible **for T5 to fire before T3**.

One **shortest firing sequence** demonstrating this is:
```
T1, T2b, T4, T5
```

### Final Answer:

**Yes**, a shortest firing sequence demonstrating this is:
```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```
