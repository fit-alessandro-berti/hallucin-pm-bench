# Acme Bank Micro-loan Fast-Track: Decision Points & Required Documents

## Decision Points (in sequence)

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – Confirm ID card and mobile phone; skip credit history checks.

2. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – Compare risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B:
   - **Scores differ by ≤ 2 points** → proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check
   - **Scores differ by > 2 points** → escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break, then proceed

3. **Amount Threshold Decision**:
   - **Amount < €15 000** → system auto-approves; proceed to disburse
   - **Amount ≥ €15 000** → proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval

4. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – Board votes *approve* or *reject* (only for amounts ≥ €15 000).
