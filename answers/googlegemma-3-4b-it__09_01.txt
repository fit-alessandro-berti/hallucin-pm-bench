1.  **Average cycle time for “Review Contract”:** 2.2 hours

2.  **Calculation:**

    I identified all instances of the “Review Contract” activity in the provided log. These were C-001, C-002, C-004. I then extracted the elapsed time for each of these activities. The total elapsed time was 2.2 hours. Dividing this total elapsed time by the number of occurrences (3) gives me an average of 2.2 hours.
