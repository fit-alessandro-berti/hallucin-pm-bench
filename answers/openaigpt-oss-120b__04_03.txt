**No** – the trace violates rule 3.

- **Rule 1:** `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs once, followed later by `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (both present → satisfied).  
- **Rule 2:** Because the case is **High** severity, `VP_Safety_Approval` must happen after QE and RA. It appears after RA (and thus after QE) → satisfied.  
- **Rule 3:** `Notify_Authorities` **must not** occur until **both** QE **and** RA are complete. In the trace, NA is placed **before** RA (order: QE → NA → RA), so this rule is **violated**.  
- **Rule 4:** `Close_Case` occurs after NA and after VP, so it satisfies rule 4.  

Since rule 3 is breached, the recall handling trace 2025‑05‑RX17 is **non‑compliant** with the official recall‑handling ruleset R.
