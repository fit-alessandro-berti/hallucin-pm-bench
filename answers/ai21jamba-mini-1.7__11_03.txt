# Memo: Recommendations to Improve Orion’s Loan Processing Efficiency

**Dear COO,**

Below are the three worst-performing activities in Orion’s loan processing, identified by their joint contribution to SLA breaches and long waiting times:

- **Risk Review:**
	- Exceeds its SLA by **300 seconds (500%)**, with an average throughput time of **600 seconds vs. a target of 300 seconds**.
	- Experiences the longest waiting time among activities, with **480 seconds (80% over the target)**.
	- **Recommendation:** Investigate inefficiencies in decision-making and consider automating risk scoring to reduce manual review bottlenecks.
- **Credit Assessment:**
	- Exceeds its SLA by **160 seconds (67%)**, with an average throughput time of **300 seconds vs. a target of 240 seconds**.
	- Has the fourth-longest waiting time (**200 seconds**).
	- **Recommendation:** Review whether workload distribution among assessors is optimized and explore parallel processing for simpler cases.
- **Legal Approval:**
	- Exceeds its SLA by **300 seconds (50%)**, with an average throughput time of **900 seconds vs. a target of 600 seconds**.
	- Holds the second-longest waiting time (**600 seconds**).
	- **Recommendation:** Introduce preliminary approvals for straightforward cases to reduce queueing delays.

By addressing these bottlenecks, Orion can significantly improve SLA compliance and enhance overall customer experience.
