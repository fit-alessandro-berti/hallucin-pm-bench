**Answer 1:**  
**No**, it is not possible.  

**Answer 2 (explanation):**  
Transition **T5** requires place **P5**, which only gains a token after **T4** fires. In turn, **T4** needs place **P4** to be marked. Place **P4** receives tokens either from **T3** (from **P2**) or **T7** (from **P3** via **T2**). However, even if we use the route **T1 → T2 → T7 → T4**, place **P2** remains marked from **T1**, leaving a token at **P2** unused. To fire **T5**, the precondition explicitly includes **P2**, meaning the token on **P2** can only be removed by first firing **T3**. Thus, **T3** inevitably must fire before **T5**; no sequence exists allowing **T5** before **T3**.
