The fact is **not accurate**.

Justification:
In Case ID 1001, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund". In Case ID 1003, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Quality_Check" which then occurs before "Authorize_Refund". The provided log fragment does not contain any instance where "Authorize_Refund" immediately precedes "Update_Inventory".
