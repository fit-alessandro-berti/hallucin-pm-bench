Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling — Top performance issues and actions

1) **Request_Documents** is the primary bottleneck: **lowest throughput (190/day)** and by far the **highest wait time (150 min)**, with **very high rework (22.0%)** and elevated **SLA breaches (5.5%)**. **Action:** Reduce rework by standardizing/automating document requests (pre-populated checklists by claim type) and target a **rework-rate reduction from 22% to <10%**, which should directly lift throughput and cut queue time.

2) **Review_Documents** shows the **highest processing time (25 min)**, **highest variability (stdev 9)**, and **highest SLA breach rate (12.4%)**, with moderate rework (5.3%). **Action:** Implement triage + standardized review templates and route complex cases to specialists; manage to **cut stdev from 9 to ~5** to reduce SLA breaches.

3) **Initial_Assessment** under-performs via **high wait time (18 min)** and **highest throughput shortfall vs upstream (270 vs 280/day)**, plus **SLA breaches (3.2%)**. **Action:** Add capacity or rebalance staffing to eliminate the queue; aim to **reduce wait from 18 to <10 min** and restore throughput to ≥280/day.
