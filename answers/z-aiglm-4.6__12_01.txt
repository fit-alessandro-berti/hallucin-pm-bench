No, the fact is not accurate.

Justification:
In both Case 1001 and Case 1003, the activity "Update_Inventory" occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund", which is the reverse of the claimed order.

*   **Case 1001:** The sequence is `...Update_Inventory`, `Authorize_Refund...`
*   **Case 1003:** The sequence is `...Update_Inventory`, `Quality_Check`, `Authorize_Refund...`
