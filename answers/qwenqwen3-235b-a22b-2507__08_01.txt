**Answer: No**, it is **not possible** for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

---

### **Proof of Impossibility:**

We analyze the preconditions for **T5** and the order of events.

- **T5’s enabling condition**:  
  T5 has a **normal input arc from p3** and an **inhibitor arc from p4**.  
  → This means T5 is enabled **only when**:
  - p3 contains **at least one token**, **and**
  - p4 contains **zero tokens**.

- **Initial marking**: p0 = 1, all others = 0.

- **Firing sequence starts with T1** (only enabled transition initially):  
  T1: p0 → p1 + p2  
  New marking: p1 = 1, p2 = 1, others 0.

- Now:
  - **T2** (p1 → p3) is enabled.
  - **T3** (p2 → p4) is enabled.
  - **T5** requires p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0.

Suppose, for contradiction, that **T5 fires before T3**.

Then T2 must fire before T5 (so that p3 gets a token). Possible intermediate step:
- Fire **T2**: p1 → p3  
  → Now: p3 = 1, p2 = 1, p1 = 0, p4 = 0.

Now p3 = 1, p4 = 0 → **T5 is enabled**.

But has **T3** fired yet? **No**, because p4 is still 0.

→ So can we fire T5 now?

Yes — **T5 is enabled**: p3 has 1 token, p4 has 0 tokens.

Wait! This suggests T5 **can** fire before T3?

But let’s double-check:  
We are asked: **Can T5 fire before T3?**  
That is: Is there a firing sequence in which **T5 occurs**, and **T3 has not yet occurred**?

Yes — in the marking after T1 and T2:
- p3 = 1, p4 = 0 → T5 is enabled.
- T3 has not fired yet.

So we **can** fire T5 **before** T3.

Wait — but earlier we said "no", now we're seeing it might be **yes**.

Let’s carefully reevaluate.

### Let’s Construct a Firing Sequence:

**Initial marking**: [p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0]

1. **Fire T1**: consumes p0, produces p1 and p2  
   → marking: p1=1, p2=1, others 0.

2. **Fire T2**: consumes p1, produces p3  
   → marking: p3=1, p2=1, others 0.

Now:
- T3 is enabled (p2=1)
- T5 is enabled? → needs p3 ≥ 1 (yes), and **p4 = 0** (yes! p4 is still 0)

✅ **So T5 is enabled**.

3. **Fire T5**: consumes 1 token from p3, produces p6  
   → new marking: p2=1, p6=1, p3=0, p4=0, others 0.

T3 has not fired yet — it still can (p2=1).

So T5 fired **before** T3.

### ✅ Conclusion:

**Yes**, it **is possible** for **T5 to fire before T3**.

---

### Concrete Firing Sequence:

**T1 → T2 → T5**

- After T1: p1=1, p2=1
- After T2: p3=1, p2=1
- Now: p3=1, p4=0 → T5 is enabled
- Fire T5: consumes p3, puts token in p6

T3 has not fired yet — it still could (p2=1), but T5 occurred earlier.

---

### Final Answer:

**Yes**, it is possible.

**Firing sequence**: T1, T2, T5

**Justification**:  
After firing T1 and T2, place p3 contains a token and p4 is empty. Since T5 requires p3 ≥ 1 and is **inhibited only if p4 has tokens**, it is enabled when p4 = 0. Thus, T5 can fire while T3 has not yet fired (even though T3 is also enabled). The inhibitor arc from p4 enables T5 precisely when p4 is empty, i.e., before T3 fires.
