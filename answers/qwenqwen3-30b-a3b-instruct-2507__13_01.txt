1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **once** in this fragment.  
2. There are 18 total logged events.  
   - 1 event is “Manual_Fraud_Check”.  
   - Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 = 5.555... ≈ **5.56%** (rounded to two decimal places).  
3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.  
4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of monthly frequency based on this fragment is unreliable are:  
   - **Small sample size**: The fragment includes only 18 events across 4 cases, which is insufficient to reliably estimate a monthly frequency.  
   - **Non-representative cases**: The fragment includes only 4 cases (A1001 to A1004), and only one of them (A1002) includes the “Manual_Fraud_Check” activity. This skewed distribution may not reflect the broader population of orders, especially since no other cases in the fragment exhibit this activity.
