1️⃣ **1 time**  
The exact string "Manual Fraud Check" appears **once** (Case 1002 on 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z). Other fraud-check activities use different strings ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)").

2️⃣ **Why misestimation occurs**:  
This excerpt covers only **3 cases** (1001–1003) from March 1, representing a tiny fraction of a month-long log. An analyst seeing *only this snippet* might assume "Manual Fraud Check" is rare (1 occurrence), but the full 31-day log could have hundreds of cases where fraud checks were automatic (e.g., Cases 1001, 1003) or omitted entirely. The excerpt’s narrow scope (single day, limited cases) fails to reflect daily volume or activity distribution across the entire month, risking overestimation of manual checks’ rarity. (118 words)
