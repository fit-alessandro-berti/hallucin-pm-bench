Based on the provided event-log excerpt:

1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time (Case 1002 at 09:07:13Z).

2️⃣ An analyst relying on this snippet faces **sampling bias** and **data quality** issues. With only three cases (N=3) captured over a single two-hour window, the observed frequency (33%) lacks statistical significance and may reflect specific morning workloads rather than the monthly average. Furthermore, the log demonstrates inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., Case 1001 uses "Automatic Fraud Check" while Case 1003 uses "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). If similar naming variations exist for manual checks (e.g., "Man. Fraud Check" or "Manual Verify"), querying strictly for “Manual Fraud Check” will significantly underreport the actual volume of work in the full dataset.
