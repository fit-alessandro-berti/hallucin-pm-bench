**Question 1.** Yes.

**Question 2.** The minimal firing sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

**Explanation:**
T5 requires tokens in P2 and P5. P2 gets a token from T1. P5 gets a token from T4 (needs P4). P4 gets a token from T3 (needs P2) *or* T7 (needs P3). By firing T1, we get tokens in P1 and P2. From {P1, P2}, fire T2 to get {P3, P2}. From {P3, P2}, fire T7 to get {P4, P2}. From {P4, P2}, fire T4 to get {P5, P2}. This state ({P2:1, P5:1}) enables T5. T3 was not fired in the sequence T1, T2, T7, T4. Therefore, T5 can fire before T3.
