No

Justify your decision by citing the relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences:
- For `C001`, the activity sequence is **"Receive_Order", "Validate_Payment", "Pack_Items"**, and there are no other activities between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment" for this case.
- For `C002`, the activity sequence is **"Receive_Order", "Pack_Items", "Validate_Payment"**, and there is another activity ("Pack_Items") between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".
- For `C003`, the activity sequence is **"Receive_Order", "Validate_Payment", "Ship_Order"**, and there are no other activities between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment" for this case.
- For `C004`, the activity sequence is **"Receive_Order", "Check_Fraud", "Validate_Payment", "Pack_Items"**, and there are two activities ("Check_Fraud" and "Pack_Items") between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".

Since in cases `C002` and `C004` there are activities other than "Validate_Payment" between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment", the fact is **not accurate** with respect to the given event-log excerpt.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
```python
print("No")
print("""Justify your decision by citing the relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences:
- For `C001`, the activity sequence is **\"Receive_Order\", \"Validate_Payment\", \"Pack_Items\"**, and there are no other activities between \"Receive_Order\" and \"Validate_Payment\" for this case.
- For `C002`, the activity sequence is **\"Receive_Order\", \"Pack_Items\", \"Validate_Payment\"**, and there is another activity (\"Pack_Items\") between \"Receive_Order\" and \"Validate_Payment\".
- For `C003`, the activity sequence is **\"Receive_Order\", \"Validate_Payment\", \"Ship_Order\"**, and there are no other activities between \"Receive_Order\" and \"Validate_Payment\" for this case.
