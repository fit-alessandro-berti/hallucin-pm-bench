SUBJECT: Q1-2025 Claims Performance Brief

Three activities critically underperform:

1. **Request_Documents**: Highest wait time (150 min) and rework rate (22.0%), driving a throughput drop from 270 to 190 cases/day.
   *Action:* Deploy automated completeness checks to cut rework cycles.

2. **Review_Documents**: Highest SLA breach (12.4%) and processing variability (stdev 9 min), with longest execution (25 min).
   *Action:* Standardize review protocols to reduce variability and breaches.

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Next highest SLA breach (3.2%) and elevated wait time (18 min) versus upstream steps.
   *Action:* Rebalance triage staffing to reduce queue accumulation.

These bottlenecks constrain overall flow. Immediate remediation here will stabilize downstream throughput and compliance.
