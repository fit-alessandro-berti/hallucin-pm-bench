Add an intermediate timer event (id="Timer_SLA") with timeDuration "PT48H". Connect a sequence flow from Start_Claim to Timer_SLA and another from Timer_SLA to Task_Triage. This ensures that if the claim hasn't progressed to Task_Triage within 48 hours of submission (e.g., delayed in Task_RequestDocs), the timer automatically triggers Task_Triage immediately, satisfying the SLA requirement. No new activities are added; only the timer event and sequence flows are introduced, leveraging existing elements like Task_Triage for the escalation response. (98 words)
