Connect `Start_Claim` directly to `Task_Triage`. By inserting a new flow from the start event to the triage task, the process bypasses the manual `Task_Receive`, `Task_Check`, and the intermediate gateway `GW_Docs`. This elimination of upstream manual processing ensures the claim hits triage immediately, meeting the SLA without adding any new tasks.
