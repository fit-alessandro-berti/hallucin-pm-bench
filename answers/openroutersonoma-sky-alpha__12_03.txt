No

**Justification:** The FACT is inaccurate because "Validate_Payment" does not *always* occur immediately after "Receive_Order" across all cases in the log excerpt. While it holds true for C001 (sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items) and C003 (sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order), it is violated in C002 (sequence: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment, with Pack_Items in between) and C004 (sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items, with Check_Fraud in between). Since the FACT claims this occurs "always" but counterexamples exist, it is not accurate with respect to the event-log excerpt.
