**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Top 3 Bottlenecks & Actions

The three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Review Documents**
   - Highest SLA breach (12.4%) and rework rate (5.3%), coupled with long processing time (25 min) and high variability (9 min). Cases wait 30 min on average before starting.

2. **Request Documents**
   - Extreme wait time (150 min) and rework rate (22%), despite short processing time (5 min). This suggests inefficient document-chasing loops.

3. **Initial Assessment**
   - Elevated SLA breach (3.2%) and rework rate (1.8%), with moderate processing time (12 min) and wait time (18 min).

**Recommended actions:**
1. **Review Documents:** Implement a pre-review checklist to reduce rework and variability; pilot a 24-hour SLA for simple cases.
2. **Request Documents:** Automate document requests via customer portal to cut wait time and rework loops.
3. **Initial Assessment:** Introduce a triage rule to fast-track low-complexity claims, reducing queueing and rework.
