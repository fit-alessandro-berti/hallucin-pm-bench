**Summary of Reasoning and Final Answer:**

We analyze Process B and identify the points where parallel splits occur. Each parallel split creates concurrent branches; the tasks immediately following the split on these branches can execute simultaneously. In Process B, there are two parallel splits:

1. After "Receive_Stock," the process splits into "Quality_Check" and "Update_Inventory." These tasks form the first concurrent set.
2. After "Store_Items," the process splits into "Generate_Replenishment_Report" and "Notify_Procurement," forming the second concurrent set.

Thus, the concurrent task sets are:

1. Quality_Check, Update_Inventory
2. Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement

These are the only sets of tasks in Process B that lie on different branches of the same parallel construct and can therefore execute concurrently.

\[
\boxed{1. \text{Quality_Check, Update_Inventory, }\, 2. \text{ Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}}
\]

However, given the nature of the task, a more readable format might be preferred. Therefore, we present the answer in a more structured manner:

The concurrent task sets in Process B are:

1. Quality_Check, Update_Inventory
2. Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement

Each set is ordered by their appearance in the process flow.

\boxed{1, 2}
