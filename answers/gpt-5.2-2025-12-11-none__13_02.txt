1) **Count of “Manual_Fraud_Check” events:** **1**  
(only in case **C05**)

2) Percentages (rounded to **two decimals**):  
- a) **% of all events:** total events = **48**.  
  \[
  \frac{1}{48}\times 100 = 2.08\%
  \]
  **Answer: 2.08%**  
- b) **% of unique cases (12) that include it:** cases with Manual_Fraud_Check = **1** (C05).  
  \[
  \frac{1}{12}\times 100 = 8.33\%
  \]
  **Answer: 8.33%**

3) (≤100 words)  
With only **1 event in 48** and **1 of 12 cases**, “Manual_Fraud_Check” has extremely low support, so any measured impact on cycle time, cost, or outcomes is dominated by a single case (C05). This makes estimates unstable and not representative: models may overfit to this one occurrence, infer spurious correlations (e.g., “manual check leads to fast approval”), and distort bottleneck or routing probabilities. In predictive settings, it can create misleading rules that won’t generalise beyond this slice.
