### Responses:

1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **exactly once** in the event log fragment.
2. The percentage of all logged events that includes **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** is:$$\frac{1}{18} \times 100 = 5.56\%$$
3. The case identifier(s) that contain **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** are:
	- A1002
4. **Two sampling-related reasons** why the estimate of the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable are:
	- **Limited Sample Size**: The event log fragment includes only 18 lines, making it a small sample of the full monthly dataset. A small sample size increases the risk of overfitting to specific trends or outliers.
	- **Temporal and Contextual Bias**: This fragment only captures a single day's events. Monthly estimates may not account for variability in activity occurrence, such as fluctuations due to time of day, day of the week, or external factors (e.g., seasonal changes, weekends, or holidays). This limits the generalizability of the findings to the full month.
