**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   – Compares the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B.  
   – If the scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues to step 6.  
   – If the scores differ by **> 2 points**, the case is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision before proceeding.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   – If the requested loan **amount < €15 000**, the system **auto-approves**.  
   – If the requested loan **amount ≥ €15 000**, the application proceeds to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**  
   – The Micro-loan Board votes to **approve** or **reject** the application (only for amounts ≥ €15 000).
