**1. Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**

The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1** time (Case A1002).

**2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**

Total logged events = 18.
Occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check" = 1.

Percentage = (1 / 18) * 100% $\approx$ 5.5555...%

Percentage (rounded) = **5.56%**

**3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**

**A1002**

**4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**

1. **Duration/Time Span:** The fragment covers less than one day (2025-05-01 from 09:00:00 to 14:05:00). Extrapolating a single day's worth of data to represent a full month (a 30-fold or 31-fold generalization) is highly unreliable due to potential daily, weekly, or seasonal variations in order volume or fraud detection rules.
2. **Sample Size:** The fragment contains only 4 cases and 18 events. This is an extremely small sample size, which increases the possibility that the sample is not representative of the overall population (all monthly orders). For instance, if the actual fraud rate is 1%, finding 1 fraud check in 4 cases (25%) is statistically volatile and likely over-represents the true frequency.
