To determine compliance with Ruleset R, we evaluate each rule against the trace events in the order they occur:  

### Rule 1: QE and RA must occur once each and in that order.  
**Satisfied**: QE (event 3) precedes RA (event 5) in the trace.  

### Rule 2: If severity = "High," VP must occur after both QE and RA.  
**Satisfied**: Severity is "High," and VP (event 6) occurs after QE (3) and RA (5).  

### Rule 3: NA must not occur until after QE and RA are complete.  
**Violated**: NA (event 4) occurs **before** RA (event 5) is complete.  

### Rule 4: CC may occur only after NA (and VP if required by Rule 2).  
**Irrelevant**: Rule 3 is violated, so the trace is non-compliant regardless of CC (event 7) being after NA (4) and VP (6).  

The critical violation is Rule 3, as NA occurs before RA is complete.  

**Answer**: No
