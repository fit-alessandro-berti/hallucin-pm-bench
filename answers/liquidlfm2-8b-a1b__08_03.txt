No, it is not possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3** in any reachable marking.

Explanation:  
- Transition **T3** has input **pc** and outputs **pd**.  
- Transition **T5** has input **pd** and outputs **pf**.  
- To fire **T5**, **pc** must be available in **pc** place.  
- In the initial marking, **pc = 0**, so **T3** cannot fire.  
- The only way to evolve **pc** is via **T2** (from pa → pc), but **T2** requires pa, which is not available until pa comes from p0 via **T1**.  
- **T2** (pa → pc) precedes **pc → pd** (T3), meaning **pc** becomes active *after* **T3** could fire.  
- Once **pc** is non-zero, **T5** or **T2b** (vd → pd) could fire, but **T5** requires **pc = 0** to transition — so it must wait for **T3** or **T2**, not **T3** immediately before it.  
- Furthermore, **T5**’s firing is dependent on **T2** (pub → pc), so **T3** cannot precede **T5** because the dependency chain forces **pc** to become non-zero *before* **T5** can fire.  
- No firing sequence allows **T5** to precede **T3** — the net structure does not support causal order **T5 → T3**.

**Answer:** Not possible.  
No sequence exists where **T5** fires before **T3** in any reachable marking.
