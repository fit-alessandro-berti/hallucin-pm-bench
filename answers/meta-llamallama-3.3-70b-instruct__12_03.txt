## Step 1: Review the event-log excerpt to identify the sequence of activities for each CaseID.
The event-log excerpt provides a list of events with their corresponding CaseID, Activity, and CompleteTimestamp. To verify the FACT, we need to examine the sequence of activities for each CaseID, focusing on the relationship between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".

## Step 2: Examine each CaseID to determine if "Validate_Payment" occurs immediately after "Receive_Order".
- For C001, the sequence is Receive_Order, Validate_Payment, Pack_Items. Here, "Validate_Payment" occurs immediately after "Receive_Order".
- For C002, the sequence is Receive_Order, Pack_Items, Validate_Payment. In this case, "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order" because "Pack_Items" is in between.
- For C003, the sequence is Receive_Order, Validate_Payment, Ship_Order. Here, "Validate_Payment" occurs immediately after "Receive_Order".
- For C004, the sequence is Receive_Order, Check_Fraud, Validate_Payment, Pack_Items. In this case, "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order" because "Check_Fraud" is in between.

## Step 3: Determine the accuracy of the FACT based on the analysis.
From the analysis in Step 2, we can see that not all cases have "Validate_Payment" immediately after "Receive_Order" without any other activities in between. Specifically, C002 and C004 do not follow this pattern.

The final answer is: $\boxed{No}$
