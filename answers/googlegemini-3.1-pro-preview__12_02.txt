No. 

While the activity *Validate_Payment* does follow *Receive_Order* in cases C001, C002, and C004, this pattern is contradicted by other cases in the log fragment. Specifically, in case C003 (lines 6 and 7), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 10:43:00Z, which strictly precedes the *Receive_Order* event at 10:45:00Z. Furthermore, in case C005 (line 11), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 12:00:00Z without any preceding *Receive_Order* event recorded for that case at all, proving the claim completely false.
