Introduce a **timer intermediate event** attached to the **Start_Claim** event, set to 48 hours, connected via a sequence flow to a new **escalation end event**. Then, add a **boundary timer event** on **Task_Check** (48 hours) that triggers the same escalation if the check exceeds the SLA. Redirect the escalation path to a new end event named “End_Escalated” — ensuring auto-escalation without new tasks. This enforces SLA compliance by interrupting delays before Triage, using existing elements only.
