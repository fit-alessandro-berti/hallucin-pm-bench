1. **No**

2. The FACT is incorrect. Relevant CaseIDs and sequences:
   - **C002**: "Receive_Order" (09:30) → "Pack_Items" (09:50) → "Validate_Payment" (10:05). "Validate_Payment" is not immediately after "Receive_Order" (a "Pack_Items" activity intervenes).
   - **C004**: "Receive_Order" (10:05) → "Check_Fraud" (10:07) → "Validate_Payment" (10:20). "Validate_Payment" is not immediately after "Receive_Order" (a "Check_Fraud" activity intervenes).

These cases violate the claimed sequence constraint.
