**No**.

**Justification:**

The fact states "Validate_Payment" *always* immediately follows "Receive_Order". However, this is not true based on the provided log excerpt.

*   **C001:** "Receive_Order" is followed by "Validate_Payment" *immediately*, supporting the fact for this case.
*   **C002:** "Receive_Order" is followed by "Pack_Items", *then* "Validate_Payment". This contradicts the fact.
*   **C003:** "Receive_Order" is followed by "Validate_Payment" *immediately*, supporting the fact for this case.
*   **C004:** "Receive_Order" is followed by "Check_Fraud", *then* "Validate_Payment". This also contradicts the fact.

Since cases C002 and C004 demonstrate "Validate_Payment" does *not* always directly follow "Receive_Order", the fact is inaccurate.
