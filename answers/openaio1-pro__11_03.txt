Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment are currently our three worst-performing activities when considering both SLA overruns and elevated waiting times. Risk Review averages 600 seconds of throughput, exceeding its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds and incurring an average waiting time of 480 seconds. Legal Approval stands at 900 seconds, surpassing its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds, with a 600-second waiting time. Credit Assessment averages 300 seconds, surpassing its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds and recording a 200-second wait.

To address these gaps, the following actions are recommended:

• Risk Review: Allocate specialized personnel to parallelize evaluations, reducing the 480-second waiting bottleneck.  
• Legal Approval: Enable digital review checkpoints to streamline throughput and mitigate the 600-second waiting delay.  
• Credit Assessment: Implement pre-validation checks to cut down the 200-second wait and bring total throughput closer to the 240-second target.
