I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity because the event log data has been completely redacted. While I know the column names and structure from Artefact A, all actual timestamps, case IDs, and activity data are missing. Without the complete event log containing the start and complete times for each "Approve Invoice" activity instance, it is impossible to calculate any timing metrics. The SLA information in Artefact B provides historical context about payment timing but does not contain the granular process execution data needed for cycle time analysis.
