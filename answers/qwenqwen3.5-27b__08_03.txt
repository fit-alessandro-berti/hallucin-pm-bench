Yes.

**Shortest firing sequence:**
`T1, T2b, T4, T5`

**Explanation:**
1.  **T1** fires (consumes `p0`, produces `pa`, `pb`). Marking: `{pa:1, pb:1}`.
2.  **T2b** fires (consumes `pa`, produces `pd`). Marking: `{pd:1, pb:1}`. Note: `pc` remains 0, so `T3` is not enabled.
3.  **T4** fires (consumes `pb`, produces `pe`). Marking: `{pd:1, pe:1}`. `T3` is still not enabled.
4.  **T5** fires (consumes `pd`, `pe`, produces `pf`). Marking: `{pf:1}`.

In this sequence, **T5** fires at step 4. **T3** requires a token in `pc` to fire. `pc` is only produced by `T2` or `T6`. `T2` consumes `pa` (which was consumed by `T2b`), and `T6` requires `pf` (which is only produced after `T5` fires). Therefore, `T3` cannot fire before `T5` in this path. Since `T5` fires while `T3` has not yet fired (and is not enabled), the condition is satisfied.
