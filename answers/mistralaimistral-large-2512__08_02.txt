**Question 1:** No.

**Question 2:** T5 cannot fire before T3 because T5 requires a token in P5 (produced by T4) and a token in P2 (produced by T1). However, T4 needs a token in P4, which can only come from T3 or T7. Since T7 depends on T2 (which requires P1 from T1), the earliest P4 can be marked is after T3 fires. Thus, T3 must fire before T5 can fire. A minimal sequence where T3 fires before T5 is: **[T1, T2, T3, T7, T4, T5]**. No sequence allows T5 to precede T3.
