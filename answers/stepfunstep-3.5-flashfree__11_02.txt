**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Critical Performance Gaps  

**Worst-Performing Activities**  

1. **Request_Documents**  
   - **Why:** Extreme average wait time (150 min) coupled with the highest rework rate (22%) and elevated SLA breaches (5.5%). This indicates a severe bottleneck in document collection, causing downstream delays and repetitive requests.  
   - **Action:** Implement a centralized, digital document request portal with automated customer reminders and deadline tracking to reduce manual follow-up and wait times.  

2. **Review_Documents**  
   - **Why:** Highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and second-highest rework (5.3%), alongside significant processing time variability (stdev = 9 min). This reflects inconsistent, error-prone reviews that fail to meet standards.  
   - **Action:** Introduce a tiered review workflow—route straightforward cases via a pre-screening checklist to junior staff, reserving complex cases for senior reviewers to improve consistency and reduce rework.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - **Why:** Third-longest wait time (18 min) and third-highest SLA breach (3.2%). Though less severe, this front-loaded delay propagates inefficiencies downstream.  
   - **Action:** Deploy a real-time coverage-check tool with embedded policy rules to accelerate initial decisions and reduce assessment variability.  

**Note:** All other activities perform within acceptable ranges on key metrics.
