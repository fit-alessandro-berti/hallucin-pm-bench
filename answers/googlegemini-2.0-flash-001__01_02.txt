Okay, here's a summary of the decision points and required documents in Acme Bank's Micro-loan Fast-Track process, using the exact terminology:

**Decision Points:**

*   **Underwriter Alignment Gate:** Determines whether the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B are within the acceptable range (≤ 2 points difference). If not, it triggers escalation to the Harmonisation Committee.
*   **Amount Threshold Decision:** Determines whether the loan amount is less than €15 000. If it is, the application auto-approves. If it is ≥ €15 000, the application proceeds to the Micro-loan Board.
*   **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA):** The board votes to either approve or reject loan applications with amounts ≥ €15 000.

**Required Documents:**

*   Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
*   Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
*   Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
*   Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
*   Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
*   Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)
