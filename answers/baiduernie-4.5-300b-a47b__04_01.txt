Non-compliant
1. **Rule 1 Violation**: The PO amount of €12,300 exceeds €10,000, requiring two approvals (Procurement Officer and CFO) before `Issue_PO`. While both approvals (`Approve_PO` at event 2 and `Approve_PO_CFO` at event 3) occur before `Issue_PO` (event 5), the rule does not specify execution by distinct roles. However, the issue lies in other violations.
2. **Rule 2 Compliance**: The presence of `Expedite_Flag` (event 4) makes `Quality_Check` optional and mandates `Risk_Assessment` before the first `Ship_Goods`. `Ship_Goods` (event 8) is preceded by `Risk_Assessment` (event 9), satisfying the requirement.
3. **Rule 3 Compliance**: `Three_way_match` (event 10) occurs within two activities after `Goods_Received` (event 6), with only one intervening activity (`Move_to_Quality` at event 7).
4. **Rule 4 Violation**: After `Approve_PO_CFO` (event 3, performed by CFO), the next activity (`Expedite_Flag` at event 4, performed by System) is not executed by Intern. While this check passes, the actual violation occurs later: `Move_to_Quality` (event 7, performed by Intern) **directly follows** `Risk_Assessment` (event 9, performed by Risk_Manager), but Rule 4 restricts only the CFO role. However, the critical violation stems from **Rule 2’s interaction with Rule 4**: `Ship_Goods` (event 8, Logistics) occurs before `Risk_Assessment` (event 9), violating the requirement for `Risk_Assessment` to precede the **first `Ship_Goods`** (even under `Expedite_Flag`). This misplacement invalidates Rule 2, but the provided trace’s timeline actually reflects `Risk_Assessment` after `Ship_Goods`, which is non-compliant with Rule 2. 
5. **Rule 5 Compliance**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event 11), and no subsequent activities exist.

**Primary Non-Compliance**: Rule 2 is violated because `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurs **after** the first `Ship_Goods` (event 8), despite the `Expedite_Flag` requiring it before shipping. **Additionally**, Rule 4 is not violated in the CFO-Intern sequence but exposed confusion in Rule 2’s application. The decisive failure is **Rule 2** due to late `Risk_Assessment`.
