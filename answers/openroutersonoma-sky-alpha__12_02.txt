The fact is inaccurate because Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order in the log fragment. For case C001 (lines 1-2), it follows Receive_Order as expected. For case C002 (lines 3 and 5), it also follows Receive_Order (with Check_Inventory in between at line 4). For case C004 (lines 8-9), it follows Receive_Order. However, for case C003 (lines 6-7), Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order, directly violating the claim. Similarly, for case C005 (line 11), Validate_Payment appears without any preceding Receive_Order in that case (followed only by Cancel_Order at line 12), again showing it does not follow Receive_Order.
