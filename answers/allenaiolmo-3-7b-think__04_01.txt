Non-compliant  
1. **Rule 2 Violation**: The trace includes an `Expedite_Flag` (step 4), but the `Risk_Assessment` (step 9) occurs **after** the first `Ship_Goods` (step 8). Rule 2 requires `Risk_Assessment` to happen **before** the first `Ship_Goods`, which is not satisfied here.  
2. **Rule 3 Violation**: After `Goods_Received` (step 6), the `Three_way_match` (step 10) is **four activities later** (distance = 4), exceeding the allowed maximum of 2 activities (distance ≤ 2). This violates the requirement for timely completion of `Three_way_match`.  

Other rules (1, 4, 5) are satisfied.
