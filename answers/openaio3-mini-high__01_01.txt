Below is a summary of the key decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process along with a list of the required documents:

Decision Points:
1. Triage Eligibility Check – The triage agent validates the refund claim by comparing details against the FlightManifest and the WeatherReport. This check determines whether the claim can move forward.
2. Finance Pre‐Approval – The finance controller reviews the claim using the EligibilityChecklist and decides whether to pre‐approve it.
3. High‑Value Refund Assessment – A conditional branch is reached when the refund amount exceeds €1,000. In that case, the claim must undergo an additional review by the Senior Auditor, which requires inclusion of the AuditTrail. Claims for €1,000 or less proceed directly to refund payment after finance pre‐approval.

Required Documents:
• RefundRequestForm – Submitted by the customer to start the claim.
• FlightManifest – Used by the triage agent to validate eligibility.
• WeatherReport – Also used by the triage agent during the eligibility check.
• EligibilityChecklist – Used by the finance controller for pre‐approval.
• AuditTrail – Required during Senior_Auditor_Review for high‑value claims.
• BankTransferAuthorization – Needed by the finance team to execute the refund payment.
• RefundConfirmationPDF – Emailed to the passenger as confirmation of the processed refund.
