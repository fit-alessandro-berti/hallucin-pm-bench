1️⃣ The exact activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **1 time** in the provided excerpt (CaseID **1002**).

2️⃣ This snippet may mislead an analyst about manual fraud checks' overall frequency because:
- It’s a tiny subset of a month-long log; rare events might appear inflated if this snippet is unrepresentative.
- Activity names vary slightly (e.g., *"Automatic Fraud Check"*, *"Fraud Check (Automatic)"*). Without full data, analysts might overlook rodent name inconsistencies or misclassify similar variants.
- Selection bias: if the snippet was cherry-picked (e.g., for_high-fraud applications), manual checks may seem more common than they are in the full dataset. Without context, this excerpt’s ratios may not reflect the month’s distribution.
