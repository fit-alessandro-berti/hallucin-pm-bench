Non-compliant

1.  **Rule 2 violation:** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), which mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must occur before `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at event #9.
2.  **Rule 3 violation:** The activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within two activities after `Goods_Received`. `Goods_Received` is event #6. `Three_way_match` should have occurred at event #7 or #8. Instead, it occurs at event #10, which is a distance of 4 (10 - 6 = 4) from `Goods_Received`.
