The fact is **not accurate**.  

**Justification**:  
- In **Case 1001**, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55, followed by "Authorize_Refund" at 08:30:02.  
- In **Case 1003**, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, followed by "Authorize_Refund" at 10:22:18.  
In both cases where both activities are present, "Authorize_Refund" does **not** precede "Update_Inventory". The claim contradicts the observed sequence.
