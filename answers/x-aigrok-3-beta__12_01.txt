No, the fact is not accurate with respect to the provided event-log fragment. The claim states that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case, but the data shows otherwise. In Case 1001, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55, before "Authorize_Refund" at 08:30:02, contradicting the claimed sequence. In Case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not appear at all, so the relationship cannot be evaluated. In Case 1003, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, before "Authorize_Refund" at 10:22:18, again contradicting the claim. Therefore, the data does not support the statement that "Authorize_Refund" always precedes "Update_Inventory" immediately.
