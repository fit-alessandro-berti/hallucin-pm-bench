**Executive Memo**

Based on the Q1-2025 Claims Handling dashboard, the three worst-performing activities are **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.

- **Request_Documents**: Highest rework (22%) and avg wait time (150 min). Excessive rework creates a severe bottleneck.  
  **Action**: Reduce rework by 50% through process redesign (e.g., clearer document requests) to cut wait times and increase throughput.

- **Review_Documents**: Longest processing time (25 min), high variability (stdev 9 min), and highest SLA breach (12.4%).  
  **Action**: Standardize review steps and provide targeted training to reduce processing time and variability, aiming for SLA compliance <5%.

- **Initial_Assessment**: Elevated wait (18 min) and processing times (12 min) cause 3.2% SLA breaches, indicating capacity constraints.  
  **Action**: Add one FTE to this activity to reduce wait and processing times by 30%.

These data-driven interventions will address the most critical pain points and improve overall process performance.
