Introduce a **time-based exclusion gateway** after `Task_Check` to automatically escalate incomplete claims not reaching `GW_Docs` within 48 hours, using a timer attribute (e.g., flow from `GW_Docs` triggers escalation after 48 hours of condition `missing` being true but not resolved. This enforces SLA compliance without new tasks by leveraging existing `f4` (Task_RequestDocs) duration tracking via an explicit timer event tied to AML/claim tracking system, ensuring automatic escalation upon SLA breach. The current flow can be enhanced by adding a timer-backed event gate, placing escalation logic directly after `Task_RequestDocs`—not altering tasks, just flow control—to tighten timing enforcement.
