Below is a summary of the decision points in Contoso Airlines' flight-refund process, based solely on the provided process description. I have also listed all the required documents mentioned in the description. No additional activities or artefacts have been introduced.

### Summary of Decision Points
In Contoso’s process, there is only one explicit decision point:

- **After Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: The process checks if the refund amount is greater than €1,000. If it is, the case proceeds to Senior_Auditor_Review, which must include the AuditTrail. If it is not, the process moves directly to the next applicable step (Process_Refund_Payment, once its conditions are met).

This decision determines whether an additional review step is required based on the refund amount.

### List of All Required Documents
The following documents are explicitly mentioned in the process description. They are listed with their associated steps for context, without introducing any new elements:

- **RefundRequestForm**: Used in Customer_Submit_Claim, where the passenger completes it online.
- **FlightManifest**: Used in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility, where it is checked against the claim.
- **WeatherReport**: Used in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility, where it is checked against the claim.
- **EligibilityChecklist**: Used in Finance_Controller_PreApprove, where the finance controller signs off on it.
- **AuditTrail**: Required in Senior_Auditor_Review for high-value claims (i.e., refunds greater than €1,000).
- **BankTransferAuthorization**: Required in Process_Refund_Payment, where it must be signed for the finance team to execute payment.
- **RefundConfirmationPDF**: Used in Issue_Confirmation_Letter, where it is emailed to the passenger.
