Non-compliant  
1. Rule 2: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity 4, timestamp 2025-05-02 12:05), so `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first `Ship_Goods` (activity 8, timestamp 2025-05-06 08:44). However, `Risk_Assessment` (activity 9, timestamp 2025-05-06 09:40) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods`, violating the requirement.  
2. Rule 3: After `Goods_Received` (activity 6, timestamp 2025-05-06 08:44), `Three_way_match` (activity 10, timestamp 2025-05-06 11:52) must be completed within the next two activities (i.e., at activity 7 or 8). Instead, it occurs at activity 10, which is four activities after `Goods_Received` (distance = 4 > 2), violating the rule.
