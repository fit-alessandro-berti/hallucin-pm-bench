Okay, let's analyze the Petri net PN-8.

**Question 1:** Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3 in a reachable marking.

**Question 2:** Here's minimal firing sequence demonstrating this:

1.  **T1**: The marking changes from {P0} to {P1, P2}.
2.  **T2**: The marking changes from {P1, P2} to {P2, P3}.
3.  **T7**: The marking changes from {P2, P3} to {P2, P4}.
4.  **T4**: The marking changes from {P2, P4} to {P2, P5}.
5.  **T5**: The marking changes from {P2, P5} to {P6}.

In this sequence, T5 fires using tokens from P2 and P5, where P5 was generated by T4. T4 fired before the arrival of a token at P4 from T3. Therefore, T5 fired before T3.
