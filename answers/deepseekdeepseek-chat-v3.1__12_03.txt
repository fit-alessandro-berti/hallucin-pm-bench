No

**Justification:**  
The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" **always** occurs immediately after "Receive_Order", with no other activities in between. However, this is not the case for all instances in the log.

- **Case C002**: After "Receive_Order" (09:30:00), the next activity is "Pack_Items" (09:50:00), not "Validate_Payment". "Validate_Payment" occurs later at 10:05:00.
- **Case C004**: After "Receive_Order" (10:05:00), the next activity is "Check_Fraud" (10:07:00), not "Validate_Payment". "Validate_Payment" occurs at 10:20:00.

Therefore, the FACT is not accurate for the entire log, as there are cases where other activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".
