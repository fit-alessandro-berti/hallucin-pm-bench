1. The average cycle time (in hours) of activity “Approve Invoice” cannot be computed.

2. Neither the standard deviation nor the 95 % confidence interval can be provided.

3. These metrics cannot be computed because Artefact A (the Event-Log Stub) has been fully redacted of all row data and timestamp values. Without clinical entry and exit timestamps for specific case IDs, there is no raw data available to calculate durations, across-case averages, or statistical variance. Additionally, Artefact B provides only a historical KPI for the transition between two activities, which does not constitute the active log data required for an audit of current performance.
