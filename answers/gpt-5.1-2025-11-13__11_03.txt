Subject: SLA and Waiting-Time Hotspots in Application Processing

Based on current performance data, the three worst‑performing activities, considering both SLA breaches and high waiting times, are:

1) **Legal Approval** – Average throughput time is 900s against a 600s SLA, exceeding target by **300s**, with an average waiting time of **600s** across 465 cases.

2) **Risk Review** – Average throughput time is 600s against a 300s SLA, exceeding target by **300s**, with an average waiting time of **480s** across 480 cases.

3) **Credit Assessment** – Average throughput time is 300s against a 240s SLA, exceeding target by **60s**, with an average waiting time of **200s** across 1175 cases.

Recommended actions:

- Legal Approval: • Prioritize work allocation to reduce the 600s waiting time on the 465 cases that reach this step.  
- Risk Review: • Re-balance workload or staffing to shorten the 480s waiting time for the 480 cases processed.  
- Credit Assessment: • Streamline queue management to reduce the 200s waiting time across 1175 cases.
