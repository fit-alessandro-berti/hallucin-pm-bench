**Compliant**

1. **Rule 1 is satisfied**: The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, requiring two approvals—first by a Procurement Officer and then by the CFO—before `Issue_PO`. In the trace, `Approve_PO` (by Procurement_Officer) occurs at #2, followed by `Approve_PO_CFO` (by CFO) at #3, both before `Issue_PO` at #5. Thus, approval order and prerequisites are met.

2. **Rule 2 is satisfied**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` at #4. As a result, `Quality_Check` becomes optional (it does not appear, but that is allowed), and `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first `Ship_Goods`. `Risk_Assessment` occurs at #9, after `Ship_Goods` at #8—this would be a violation **unless** the timing is re-examined.  
   → However, **closer inspection**: `Ship_Goods` occurs at #8 (09:40), and `Risk_Assessment` at #9 (10:31)—i.e., **after** `Ship_Goods`. This violates Rule 2, which requires `Risk_Assessment` **before** the first `Ship_Goods`.

   Wait — correction: This **does violate** Rule 2.

Let’s re-analyze carefully.

Re-evaluation:

- Activity #8: `Ship_Goods` at 09:40  
- Activity #9: `Risk_Assessment` at 10:31  

→ `Risk_Assessment` occurs **after** `Ship_Goods`, but Rule 2 states: *"Risk_Assessment must occur before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods"*, when `Expedite_Flag` is present.

Since `Expedite_Flag` **is** present (#4), this condition applies. `Risk_Assessment` appears **after** `Ship_Goods`, which violates Rule 2.

Additionally:
- **Rule 3**: After `Goods_Received` (#6), `Three_way_match` must occur within the next two activities.  
  - #7: Move_to_Quality  
  - #8: Ship_Goods  
  - #9: Risk_Assessment  
  - #10: Three_way_match  
  → Distance from #6 to #10 is 4 events apart — i.e., three activities in between → distance = 4 > 2 → **violates Rule 3**

Also:
- **Rule 4**: No activity by **Intern** may directly follow an activity by **CFO**.  
  - CFO acts at #3 (12:02)  
  - Next is System at #4 and #5  
  - First Intern activity is #7 (`Move_to_Quality`)  
  → Preceded by #6 (`Goods_Received` by Warehouse_Clerk) → so **no direct succession** of CFO → Intern → Rule 4 satisfied.

- **Rule 5**: Trace ends with `Archive_Record` at #11, and nothing follows → satisfied.

But now, two violations found:

- **Violation of Rule 2**: `Risk_Assessment` occurs **after** `Ship_Goods`, but must occur **before** it due to `Expedite_Flag`.
- **Violation of Rule 3**: `Three_way_match` occurs at #10, which is **4 activities after** `Goods_Received` at #6 → exceeds maximum distance of 2.

Therefore, multiple violations.

Correct judgment:

**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1 is satisfied**: The PO amount exceeds €10,000, and both required approvals (`Approve_PO` by Procurement_Officer and `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO) occur before `Issue_PO` at #5.

2. **Rule 2 is violated**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` at #4, which triggers the requirement that `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at #8, and `Risk_Assessment` occurs at #9 — i.e., after shipping. This violates the temporal order mandated by Rule 2.

3. **Rule 3 is violated**: After `Goods_Received` at #6, `Three_way_match` must occur within the next two activities (i.e., by #9 at latest). However, it occurs at #10, which is **four activities later** (distance = 4), exceeding the allowed gap of 2.

4. **Rule 4 is satisfied**: The CFO performs activity #3. The next activity by an Intern is #7 (`Move_to_Quality`), which is preceded by #6 (`Goods_Received` by Warehouse_Clerk), not directly by the CFO. Hence, no CFO → Intern adjacency.

5. **Rule 5 is satisfied**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` at #11, and there are no subsequent activities.

**Conclusion**: Two rule violations (Rule 2 and Rule 3) → **Non-compliant**.

Final answer:

**Non-compliant**  
2. Rule 2 is violated: `Risk_Assessment` (at #9) occurs after `Ship_Goods` (at #8), but must precede it when `Expedite_Flag` is present.  
3. Rule 3 is violated: `Three_way_match` (at #10) occurs four activities after `Goods_Received` (at #6), exceeding the allowed distance of two activities.
