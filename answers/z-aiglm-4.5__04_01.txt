Non-compliant

Justification:  
1. Rule 2 is violated because the trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (at event 4), but `Risk_Assessment` occurs at event 9, which is after the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods` (at event 8). The rule requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur before the first `Ship_Goods` when `Expedite_Flag` is present.  
2. Rule 3 is violated because after `Goods_Received` (at event 6), `Three_way_match` occurs at event 10. The rule requires `Three_way_match` to be completed within the next two activities (distance â‰¤ 2), but it is the fourth activity after `Goods_Received` (events 7, 8, and 9 occur in between), resulting in a distance of 4, which exceeds the limit.
