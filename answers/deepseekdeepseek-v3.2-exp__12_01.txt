Based on the provided event-log fragment, the claim is **not accurate**.

**Justification:**

The data shows that "Authorize_Refund" occurs immediately *after* "Update_Inventory" in Case 1001, not before it. The sequence for Case 1001 is:
1. Receive_Return
2. Inspect_Item
3. **Update_Inventory**
4. **Authorize_Refund**
5. Refund_Issued

Furthermore, in Case 1003, "Authorize_Refund" is the final recorded activity and is not followed by an "Update_Inventory" at all.
