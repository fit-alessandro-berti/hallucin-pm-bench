No. The event‑log fragment shows that **“Authorize_Refund” never comes directly before “Update_Inventory”** in any of the three cases.

| Case | Activity sequence (excerpt) | Relation of Authorize_Refund to Update_Inventory |
|------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **1001** | Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → **Update_Inventory** → **Authorize_Refund** → Refund_Issued | **Authorize_Refund** occurs **after** Update_Inventory, not before. |
| **1002** | Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → **Authorize_Refund** → Refund_Issued | The activity **Update_Inventory** does not appear at all. |
| **1003** | Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → **Update_Inventory** → Quality_Check → **Authorize_Refund** | **Authorize_Refund** follows **Quality_Check**, not **Update_Inventory**; there is an activity in between. |

Because in each case the claimed ordering is violated (in 1001 it is reversed, in 1002 it is absent, and in 1003 it is separated by another activity), the statement “Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory” is **not accurate** for this fragment.
