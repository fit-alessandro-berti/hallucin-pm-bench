**No**, trace 2025-05-RX17 is not compliant with ruleset R.

**Justification by rule:**

1. **Rule 1**: Violated. The rule requires both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) to occur once each and in that order. While both activities occur once, the order is incorrectâ€”QE happens before RA, which is correct, but other activities interfere with the assessment of strict sequencing. However, this rule is technically satisfied as QE precedes RA.

2. **Rule 2**: Satisfied. Since the case attribute `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen after both QE and RA. In the trace, VP occurs after both QE and RA, so this rule is not violated.

3. **Rule 3**: Violated. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until after both QE and RA are complete. In the trace, NA occurs after QE but before RA, violating this rule.

4. **Rule 4**: Satisfied. `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only after NA and, since severity is "High", also after VP. In the trace, CC occurs after both NA and VP, so this rule is not violated.

**Conclusion**: The trace is non-compliant due to the violation of Rule 3, as `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete. Even though Rules 1, 2, and 4 are satisfied, the violation of Rule 3 is sufficient to deem the trace non-compliant.
