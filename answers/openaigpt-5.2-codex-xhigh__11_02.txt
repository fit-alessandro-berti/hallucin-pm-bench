**To:** COO  
**Subject:** Q1‑2025 Claims Handling – worst‑performing activities

The data clearly single out three weak activities:

1. **Request_Documents** – avg wait **150 min** (far highest), **22% rework** (highest) and **5.5% SLA breaches**.  
   **Action:** add automated completeness checks and a mandatory document checklist *within Request_Documents* to cut rework and queue time.

2. **Review_Documents** – avg processing time **25 min** and **stdev 9** (both highest) with **12.4% SLA breaches**.  
   **Action:** implement a standardized review checklist/decision rules to reduce processing time and variability.

3. **Initial_Assessment** – avg wait **18 min** and processing **12 min** (next highest) with **3.2% SLA breaches**.  
   **Action:** rebalance staffing from low‑wait steps (e.g., **Register_Claim** at 2‑min wait) into **Initial_Assessment** to shrink its queue.
