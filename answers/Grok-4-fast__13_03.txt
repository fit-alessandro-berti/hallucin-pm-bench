2️⃣ This excerpt covers only 3 cases on March 1, 2025 (09:00–10:45 UTC), a tiny fraction of a full month's log. With just one "Manual Fraud Check" (in Case 1002), an analyst might underestimate its frequency if later cases involve more triggers (e.g., after 10:45), or overestimate if assuming this early-day snapshot represents all patterns, ignoring potential daily/weekly variations in application volumes or fraud risks.
