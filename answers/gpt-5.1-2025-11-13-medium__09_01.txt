1) The average cycle time of the activity **“Review Contract”** across all cases in the log **cannot be derived from the provided data**.

2) Explanation  
- To calculate an activity’s average cycle time, we need either:
  - start and end timestamps for each “Review Contract” event, or  
  - explicit elapsed-time/duration fields per event.  
- In the sample event log header, all timestamp and elapsed-time fields have been redacted, and only `case_id`, `activity`, and `resource` are available.  
- The historical benchmark data lists durations only for “Receive Renewal Request”, “Negotiate Terms”, and “Legal Sign-off”, not for “Review Contract”, and it is from a different customer segment (so it cannot be safely used as a proxy).  

Therefore, there is no basis in the given data to compute the average cycle time for “Review Contract”.
