1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** in this fragment.
2. There are **18 total logged events**, so the percentage is **5.56%** (1/18 ≈ 0.0556, rounded to two decimal places).
3. The case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check” is: **A1002**.
4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable are:
   - **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 18 events, making it difficult to generalize monthly trends.
   - **Temporal limitations**: The data represents a single day (2025-05-01) and cannot account for seasonal or daily variations in fraud-check frequency.
