1) To calculate the average cycle time for the activity "Review Contract," we first need to determine the elapsed time for each occurrence of this activity in the provided event log. However, the log only shows the activity name and resource, not the timestamps and elapsed time. Therefore, I cannot derive the requested value with the given data.

2) Ideally, I would calculate the average cycle time by summing up the elapsed time for each "Review Contract" activity and then dividing by the total number of occurrences. Unfortunately, due to the missing data, I cannot perform these calculations.
