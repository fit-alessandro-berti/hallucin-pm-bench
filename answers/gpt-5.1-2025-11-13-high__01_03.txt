**a) Decision points (gates / conditionals)**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3)**  
   Uses the three inputs (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow) to assign the application a discrete risk rating of **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.

2. **Conditional branch on risk and amount (Step 4)**  
   If the risk rating is **Low or Medium** *and* the requested amount is **≤ €250,000**, the process **skips Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5)**; otherwise, Step 5 is performed.

3. **Decision-Gate “TriVote” (Step 6)**  
   The application **passes** TriVote if **any two of the three** (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve, and **fails** if fewer than two approve.
