**Answer: No**

**Justification:**

The FACT is incorrect. By examining the event sequences for each case:

- **C001**: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items  
  ✓ Validate_Payment does follow immediately after Receive_Order

- **C002**: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment  
  ✗ Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment

- **C003**: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order  
  ✓ Validate_Payment does follow immediately after Receive_Order

- **C004**: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items  
  ✗ Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment

In cases C002 and C004, Validate_Payment does NOT occur immediately after Receive_Order. In C002, Pack_Items intervenes, and in C004, Check_Fraud intervenes. Therefore, the statement that Validate_Payment "always" occurs immediately after Receive_Order is false.
