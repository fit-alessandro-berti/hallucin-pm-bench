### Computation of Metrics for Activity “Approve Invoice”

#### 1. Average Cycle Time

Given that the actual event log has been entirely redacted, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time for the activity "Approve Invoice." The computation of the average cycle time requires specific timestamps for the start and end of the "Approve Invoice" activity, which are not available in the provided artefacts.

#### 2. Standard Deviation and 95% Confidence Interval

The standard deviation of the cycle time for the "Approve Invoice" activity and the 95% confidence interval cannot be computed due to the lack of actual event data. The same reasoning applies here: specific and complete information about the duration of each instance of the "Approve Invoice" activity is necessary to calculate these statistical values.

#### 3. Why Exact Metrics Cannot Be Computed

Precisely, the exact metrics cannot be computed from the information given because there is no available timestamp data to measure the actual durations and variability of the "Approve Invoice" activity. The event log (Artefact A) provided is a stub with only the column headers and no actual event data, making it impossible to perform any temporal analysis. Additionally, Aratefact B—though informative about historical averages and corporate SLA (service level agreement) metrics—provides no raw data that could be used for these specific statistical calculations.
