4) - Very small, time-limited sample: only 18 events from a single partial day (2025-05-01 09:00â€“14:05) across 4 cases, so high sampling error.
   - Non-random, temporally biased slice: a contiguous time window (not a random sample from the month), so results may not represent other days/times within the month.
