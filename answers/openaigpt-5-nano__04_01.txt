Non-compliant

Justifications:
1) Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag): Because Expedite_Flag is present, Risk_Assessment must occur before the first Ship_Goods. In Trace 24-EXP, Ship_Goods occurs at 2025-05-06 09:40, while Risk_Assessment occurs later at 2025-05-06 10:31. This violates the required ordering (Risk_Assessment must precede Ship_Goods).

2) Rule 3: After Goods_Received, Three_way_match must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). Goods_Received occurs at 2025-05-06 08:44, but Three_way_match is only completed at 2025-05-06 11:52, which is four steps after Goods_Received. This violates the distance constraint.

Notes:
- Rule 1 is satisfied: PO amount is €12,300 (> €10,000) and approvals by Procurement_Officer and CFO occur before Issue_PO.
- Rule 4 is satisfied: The CFO is followed immediately by System (not Intern).
- Rule 5 is satisfied: The trace ends with Archive_Record and has no subsequent activity.
