Decision Points:

• Underwriter Alignment Gate – In this step, the two independent risk scores (from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B) are compared. If the scores differ by 2 points or less, the process proceeds directly to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC). If not, the case is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision before continuing.

• Amount Threshold Decision – Here, the requested amount is evaluated. If the amount is less than €15 000, the system auto-approves the application. If the amount is €15 000 or more, the process advances to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA), where the board votes either to approve or reject.
