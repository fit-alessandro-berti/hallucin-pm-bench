I am unable to compute the average cycle time of the "Approve Invoice" activity, the standard deviation, or the 95% confidence interval. Artefact A, the event log stub, only provides the column headers and does not include any actual event data (timestamps). To calculate cycle time metrics, I require the actual start and complete times for each instance of the "Approve Invoice" activity. Without this data, I cannot perform the necessary statistical calculations.
