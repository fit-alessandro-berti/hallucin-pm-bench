To determine whether transition \( T5 \) can fire before transition \( T3 \), we need to analyze the Petri net and its reachable markings.

### Petri Net Analysis

The Petri net is given as follows:

- **Places:** \( p0, pa, pb, pc, pd, pe, pf \)
- **Transitions:**
  - \( T1 \): Input \( p0 \), Output \( pa, pb \)
  - \( T2 \): Input \( pa \), Output \( pc \)
  - \( T2b \): Input \( pa \), Output \( pd \)
  - \( T3 \): Input \( pc \), Output \( pd \)
  - \( T4 \): Input \( pb \), Output \( pe \)
  - \( T5 \): Input \( pd, pe \), Output \( pf \)
  - \( T6 \): Input \( pf \), Output \( pc \)

- **Initial Marking:** \( p0 = 1 \) (all other places = 0)

### Reachable Markings and Firing Sequence

1. **Initial Marking:**
   - \( p0 = 1 \)
   - \( pa = 0 \)
   - \( pb = 0 \)
   - \( pc = 0 \)
   - \( pd = 0 \)
   - \( pe = 0 \)
   - \( pf = 0 \)

2. **Firing \( T1 \):**
   - \( p0 = 0 \)
   - \( pa = 1 \)
   - \( pb = 1 \)
   - \( pc = 0 \)
   - \( pd = 0 \)
   - \( pe = 0 \)
   - \( pf = 0 \)

3. **Firing \( T2 \) or \( T2b \):**
   - \( T2 \): \( pa = 0 \), \( pc = 1 \)
   - \( T2b \): \( pa = 0 \), \( pd = 1 \)

4. **Firing \( T3 \) or \( T4 \):**
   - \( T3 \): \( pc = 0 \), \( pd = 1 \)
   - \( T4 \): \( pb = 0 \), \( pe = 1 \)

5. **Firing \( T5 \):**
   - \( T5 \): \( pd = 0 \), \( pe = 0 \), \( pf = 1 \)

6. **Firing \( T6 \):**
   - \( T6 \): \( pf = 0 \), \( pc = 1 \)

### Analysis

To determine if \( T5 \) can fire before \( T3 \), we need to check if there is a sequence where \( T5 \) can fire while \( T3 \) has not yet fired.

- For \( T5 \) to fire, we need \( pd \) and \( pe \) to be marked.
- For \( T3 \) to fire, we need \( pc \) to be marked.

Given the initial marking and the transitions:
- \( T1 \) marks \( pa \) and \( pb \).
- \( T2 \) or \( T2b \) marks \( pc \) or \( pd \).
- \( T4 \) marks \( pe \).

However, \( T3 \) requires \( pc \) to be marked, and \( T5 \) requires \( pd \) and \( pe \) to be marked. Since \( T3 \) and \( T5 \) both depend on different tokens, \( T5 \) cannot fire before \( T3 \) because \( T3 \) must fire first to mark \( pd \).

### Conclusion

It is **not possible** for transition \( T5 \) to fire before transition \( T3 \) in any reachable marking. The required tokens for \( T5 \) to fire (\( pd \) and \( pe \)) are not available before \( T3 \) has fired to mark \( pd \).
