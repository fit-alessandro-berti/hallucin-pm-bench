No, the fact is **inaccurate**.

Justification:
In **Case 1001**, the activity **"Update_Inventory"** (08:25:55) occurs **before**, not after, **"Authorize_Refund"** (08:30:02). Furthermore, in **Case 1003**, **"Update_Inventory"** (10:08:07) also precedes **"Authorize_Refund"** (10:22:18). Additionally, in Case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all. Thus, the claim that "Authorize_Refund" always immediately precedes "Update_Inventory" is contradicted by the data.
