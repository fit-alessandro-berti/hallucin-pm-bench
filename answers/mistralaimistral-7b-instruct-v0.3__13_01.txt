 1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time in this fragment.
2. To find the percentage of all logged events that this activity represents, we first need to count the total number of events. In this case, there are 18 events in total. Since "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time, the percentage is 1/18 or 0.0556 (rounded to two decimal places).
3. The case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check" are A1002.
4. Two sampling-related reasons why using this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable are:
   a. The sample size is too small: With only 18 events in this fragment, it may not accurately represent the frequency of manual fraud checks over a whole month, as there could be many more events that are not included in this sample.
   b. The fragment may not be representative of the entire population: This log fragment only includes data for four unique case identifiers (A1001, A1002, A1003, and A1004). If the frequency of manual fraud checks varies significantly among different case identifiers, using this log fragment to estimate the monthly frequency for the entire population may not be accurate.
