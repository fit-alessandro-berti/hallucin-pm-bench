**Justification**:  
- **Rule 3 Violation**: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), violating the requirement that NA must not occur until after both QE and RA are complete. In the trace, NA is at step 4, while RA occurs later at step 5.  
- **Other Rules Satisfied**:  
  - **Rule 1**: QE (step 3) precedes RA (step 5).  
  - **Rule 2**: VP (step 6) occurs after both QE and RA.  
  - **Rule 4**: CC (step 7) occurs after NA (step 4) and VP (step 6).  

The violation of Rule 3 makes the trace non-compliant.
