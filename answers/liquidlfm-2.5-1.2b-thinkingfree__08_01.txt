Yes, transition T5 can fire before T3. A concrete sequence is:  
**T1 → T2 → T5 → ...**  
Initial state: p0(1) p1(0) p2(0) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0).  
1. **T1**: p0 → p1 + p2 (state: p0=0, p1=1, p2=1).  
2. **T2**: p1 → p3 (state: p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1).  
3. **T5**: p4=0 (enabled by inhibitor), so T5 occurs here. Result: p3’s value + p4(0) via the inhibitor arc; p6 is consumed, but p4 becomes 0.  
4. After T5: p4=0 (if transition compasses p4→p6, p4 drops to 0 due to T5 consuming it). The next event (e.g., T3 requiring p2) can then trigger but could occur afterward. Thus, T5 successfully precedes T3 in this path.  

**Conclusion:** It is possible.  
\boxed{Yes}
