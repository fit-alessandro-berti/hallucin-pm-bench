Based on Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder, the pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel are identified from the description. Specifically:

- **Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines** can start simultaneously after Create_Work_Order (step 2).
- **Quality_Check and Create_Documentation** can begin in parallel right after Fabricate (step 4).

No other pairs can be executed in parallel, as other tasks have dependencies or sequential relationships.

The pairs are listed in alphabetical order both within each pair and for the overall list:
- Within each pair, tasks are sorted alphabetically (e.g., for the pair Quality_Check and Create_Documentation, Create_Documentation comes before Quality_Check alphabetically).
- The pairs are sorted alphabetically by the first task in each pair (e.g., Create_Documentation comes before Procure_Materials alphabetically).

Output:
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check  
Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
