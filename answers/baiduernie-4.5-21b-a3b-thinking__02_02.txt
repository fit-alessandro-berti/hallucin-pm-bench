**Q1:**  
The distinct cases in the fragment are C001, C002, and C003.  
- **Number of distinct cases:** 3  

**Q2:**  
For case "C002", the events occur in the following order:  
- Line 2: Receive_Order (timestamp: 2025-03-01T09:15:10)  
- Line 5: Check_Stock (timestamp: 2025-03-01T09:22:55)  
- Line 8: Arrange_Delivery (timestamp: 2025-03-01T10:15:20)  
- Line 10: Ship_Order (timestamp: 2025-03-01T10:25:40)  

**Sequence of activities:**  
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  

**Q3:**  
Across all cases, the distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" (based on the same case sequence) are:  
- For case C001: Check_Stock (precedes Ship_Order at line 7)  
- For case C002: Arrange_Delivery (precedes Ship_Order at line 10)  
- For case C003: Check_Stock (precedes Ship_Order at line 9)  

**Distinct activities (alphabetically ordered):**  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
