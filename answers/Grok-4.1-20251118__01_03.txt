### a) Decision points (gates or conditional branches)

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome** (step 3): The process produces a risk rating of Low, Medium, or High based on the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow).
2. **Skip-condition for Manual-Underwriting-Review** (after step 3 / before step 5): Manual-Underwriting-Review (step 5) is skipped if and only if the risk rating is Low or Medium AND the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less.
3. **TriVote decision gate** (step 6): The loan application passes the TriVote gate if at least any two of the three required approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) grant approval; otherwise it is rejected.
