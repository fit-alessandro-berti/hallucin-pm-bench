**No**

**Justification:**  
The FACT is not accurate because there are cases where activities other than "Validate_Payment" occur immediately after "Receive_Order":

- **Case C002**: The sequence is "Receive_Order" → "Pack_Items" → "Validate_Payment". Here, "Pack_Items" occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," not "Validate_Payment."
- **Case C004**: The sequence is "Receive_Order" → "Check_Fraud" → "Validate_Payment". Here, "Check_Fraud" occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," not "Validate_Payment."

These examples demonstrate that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order."
