We have Process B: "Manufacturing_WorkOrder". The steps are:

1. Create_Work_Order
2. Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run simultaneously.
3. Fabricate begins only after both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines are complete.
4. Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel right after Fabricate.
5. Package starts when both Quality_Check and Create_Documentation are finished.
6. Dispatch_to_Customer follows Package.
7. Close_Work_Order completes the process.

We are asked to List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above.

- According to Process B, tasks that run in parallel (based on description) occur when tasks are started at the same time, typically are pairs that are described to run simultaneously. Let's see, the description mentions pairs:

Step 2: "Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run simultaneously." That pair is considered as parallel. They run in parallel. So pair: Quality? No, sorry, that's pair is (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines). But in addition, are there any others? Let's check details.

The tasks that run in parallel that are explicitly mentioned: 
- Step 2: Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines are parallel.
- Step 4: "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation" run in parallel. So pair: (Create_Documentation, Quality_Check).

Additionally, is there additional ones? 
I see that step 5: Package starts when both those are finished, but that's not pair executed in parallel.

So the pairs are exactly two: (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines) and (Quality_Check, Create_Documentation).

Now check alphabetical order instructions. They said: "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." The format: Order tasks lexicographically. Let's assume that alphabetical means that within each pair, you must list the tasks in alphabetical order by "Task" name. I must check the names: "Procure_Materials", "Schedule_Machines" etc. Let's check alphabetical order. We have "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines" do we have any order? Let's check alphabetically: Compare “Procure_Materials” starts with "P", while “Schedule_Machines” starts with "S"? Actually "P" comes before "S". But wait within each pair, they said "alphabetical order" which typically means smallest letter first. Let’s ensure letters: for pair (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines) from the process description, alphabetical order is "Procure_Materials", then "Schedule_Machines" if we consider "P" < "S", so pair remains same order if alphabetical order "Procure_Materials" then "Schedule_Machines"? Actually checking: "Procure_Materials": letter "P" vs "Schedule_Machines": letter "S" so indeed "P" comes before "S". For pair (Quality_Check, Create_Documentation): compare alphabetical order: "Create_Documentation" has letter 'C' vs "Quality_Check" with letter 'Q'. 'C' comes before 'Q'. So that second pair alphabetically order: pair should be "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check"? But check: alphabetical order means lexicographically smaller letter appears first. Also should consider all tasks have underscores. Actually check if underscores are considered. Typically won't matter because underscore will be disregarded in alphabetical alphabetical but likely we consider alphabetical for each string: "Create_Documentation" letter ordering is used on basis of if you compare letter by letter. So yes "Create_Documentation" < "Quality_Check". So the pair should be in the order: "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check".

The overall set should be "alphabetical order", i.e. sorted list of strings. We must check alphabetical order overall, i.e. sort by the first pair's first element's alphabetical order then second letter and so on? But we have two pairs:

First pair for Process B: "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" and second pair: "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check". Need to order these pairs by alphabetical order. That means we consider the entire pair as a "set" or order them by the first element in alphabetical order across both pairs. Let's check the first element of the first pair: "Procure_Materials" (alphabetically, the string is "Procure_Materials") starts with letter "P" equals ASCII code 80. And the first element for second pair in the alphabetical order sorting but then reordering the tasks in pair alphabetical order from the second pair is "Create_Documentation". "Create_Documentation" starts with "C" letter. Now "C" < "P", because letter C is 67. So when sorting pairs by first element, then that pair should come first. But wait, we excluded? Wait earlier we check alphabetical ordering: "Pair in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." So we need to list pair one then pair two but in overall alphabetical order the pair starting with "Create_Documentation" should appear first? But then question: Should we consider tasks, or consider pairs? They say "in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." So that means each individual pair is sorted by the alphabetical order of tasks inside that pair and then sort the entire set of pairs in alphabetical order presumably lexicographically by the first task name. So the overall sorted list: Compare the first element in each pair. Among these two pairs. Pair P: "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines" vs Pair Q: "Create_Documentation" and "Quality_Check". Still out of place: the pair with lower alphabetical first element is determined by "C" vs "P". So the pair that should appear first is the one that alphabetically ordered is (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check) because "Create_Documentation" letter is 'C'. And then next pair is (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines) because "Schedule_Machines" letter S is bigger than P? Wait check: Actually we must order pairs by lexicographic order of the entire pair. It's ambiguous if we consider pair as an unordered set or ordered string. But from problem statement "Return the pairs in alphabetical order". It should be interpreted as: treat each pair as an ordered pair by alphabetical order. And then the overall list is sorted by alphabetical order of the tasks names from left to right in the config. The expected pairs: so list in overall alphabetical order meaning if I sort the pairs as two-element strings that are themselves sorted lexicographically. Then check which pair comes first. For pair (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check), its first element is Create_Documentation or should they consider tie? Because no matter - this pair is simply ("Create_Documentation", "Quality_Check"). And the pair ("Procure_Materials", "Schedule_Machines"). Now which string comes first lexicographically: "Create_Documentation" vs "Procure_Materials"? Compare letter 'C' (67) vs letter 'P' (80). So yes, "Create_Documentation" should come first. So overall ordering: the pair with tasks: "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" then "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines". But let’s re-read small instructions: "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both *within* each pair and in your overall list." So within each pair, sort the tasks alphabetically. And then sort entire pairs based on alphabetical order (with sorted pairs as rows) probably alphabetically of first element. So the sorted pairs: first pair: "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check", second pair: "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines".

Therefore, answer pairs:
Line 1: Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Line 2: Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines, but check the ordering after sorting individually: "Procure_Materials" alph comes before "Schedule_Machines"? Actually check: "Procure_Materials" starts with "P". Compare "P" vs "S": "Procure_Materials" < "Schedule_Machines" if done alphabetical. But then should they appear as "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines"? Wait, then let me re-read the instructions: "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." So list each pair, one pair per line. Each pair the left task, then the hyphen dash, then the second task. Each pair sorted by alphabetical order of tasks from left to right.

Let's re-read Process B description for simultaneous tasks:

- Step 2: "Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately... simultaneously." So tasks that run parallel in that step: Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines.

- Step 4: "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel right after Fabricate." So tasks that run parallel in that step: Quality_Check, Create_Documentation.

Now we need to check alphabetical order sorting for each pair individually. For pair (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines): which one comes first alphabetically? "P" for Procure_Materials and "S" for Schedule_Machines, so "Procure_Materials" is first. So that's the pair: "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines".

For pair (Quality_Check and Create_Documentation): alphabetical order means compare first letter: "Create_Documentation" vs "Quality_Check" (back with "Quality_Check"): for "Quality_Check", letter Q (81) vs "Create_Documentation", letter C (67). So first should be "Create_Documentation" then "Quality_Check". So that pair is "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check".

Now overall ordering: sorted alphabetically by the left element of each pair. So the left elements for these sorted pairs are "Procure_Materials" and "Create_Documentation". Alphabetically, "Create_Documentation" comes before "Procure_Materials" because C comes before P. So sorted overall list yields:
Line1: "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check"
Line2: "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines"

But wait, re-read instructions "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." It does not specify that the overall sorting is by the first letter of each pair's left element or if we sort as a Cartesian product. We have only two pairs. then sorting them, "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" comes next because "C" is first and "Procure_Materials" starts with "P". So yes.

But let me check, because sometimes the ordering might be done lexicographically by first letter of each task, which is "C" vs "P" as described, but maybe it is alphabetical order overall if you list them as letter pairs "C-Q" vs "P-S" then first pair's first letter "C" is less than second pair's first letter "P", so yes.

However, which pair should appear first? The second pair: "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" because each pair is then "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines", but "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines" in alphabetical order, the left element "Procure_Materials" starts with P, and second pair "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" has left element "Create_Documentation" that starts with C. Because C comes before P, then second pair is sorted to be first overall. So overall list: sorted in lexicographic order with first pair across alphabetical ordering:
- "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" is first (since C comes before P).
- "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" is second.

But which overall list should we display? The instructions "Return the pairs in alphabetical order," which is typically to have them sorted alphabetically by the first column then by second if same, but the pair (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines) when read is "Procure_Materials" then "Schedule_Machines", and in alphabetical order with no reordering within pair. But then in overall list, "Quality Checkout," etc. So I must list such pairs. So answer lines:
Line 1: Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Line 2: Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

Let's check step ordering in Process B pair. But check: "Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines": that is one pair. And then second pair is "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation": that is another pair. But then are there any additional pairs that can be executed in parallel? It says "may run simultaneously", but then step 4 "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel" definitely is a pair. And are there any others? Actually wait, does Task "Package" have any parallel execution? No: It says that "Package starts when both Quality_Check and Create_Documentation are finished." It didn't mention a pair that is executed in parallel. "Dispatch_to_Customer follows Package" but it's an independent non parallel process. Then "Close_Work_Order completes process," not parallel. So indeed only two pair. So answer output: Two lines.

However, the problem might be tricky: It says "List every pair of tasks in Process B". So I have to list pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel. But then exactly how many pairs? They are exactly two.

But then Note: "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." So which pair should be first? Sorted lexicographically. For pair (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines): if sorted individually then the left ordering is based on alphabetical ordering of each task name: "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines": We know "Procure_Materials" > "Schedule_Machines"? Let's re-check alphabetical ordering: Letters: "Procure_Materials": First character P vs "Schedule_Machines": S, and since P (80) < S (83) if we check letter codes, that means "Procure_Materials" should be listed first if we treat them as strings. But I must check: Additional pair candidate: "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation": within that pair if sorted properly, then "Create_Documentation" (starting with C) should be listed first because C < Q. So that pair should become "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check". Now which pair sorts first when sorting overall? Compare "Create_Documentation" (C) with "Procure_Materials" (P). "C" < "P", hence the pair with C comes before. Now if I consider each pair as separate simple alphabetical structure: pair 1: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" then pair 2: "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" because "Procure_Materials" sorted ordering letter P < letter S. So overall listing: 1) "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check", and 2) "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Materials"? Wait, check:
The second pair when sorted alphabetically is "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" because alphabetical order means order the tasks in each pair alphabetically as strings. In the second pair, "Procure_Materials" compared to "Schedule_Machines", "Procure_Materials" is "Proc...". Actually wait, is it spelled "Procure_Materials" or "Procure Materials"? The description in the given text: Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder, step 2: "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines". In text it is written as cunning: "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines" likely these tasks with underscore. I should print exactly with exact formatting? Just output them exactly as tasks names, but be careful to check parentheses. They said tasks names are like "Procure_Materials" with underscore "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines".

Double-check: I see: "Procure_Materials" starts with "P", "Schedule_Machines" starts with "S". So letters P vs S give order with P first, but if we sort lexicographically, then "P" comes first because P is less than S. But wait using ASCII, "P" (80) vs "S" (83)? Yes, that means "Procure_Materials" < "Schedule_Machines" so pair still is "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines".

So final overall listing after sorting overall by first pair's first element: Compare "Create_Documentation" (first letter 'C') with "Procure_Materials" (first letter 'P'): C < P, so that pair with C comes first. Thus final output lines, in overall alphabetical order:

And then need to use format: 
Task_X — Task_Y (with a space, then "—", then a space, then Task_Y)

So final answer: 
Line 1: "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check"
Line 2: "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines"

But must check any other potential pair? Wait, "Quality_Check" and "Create_Documentation" are also run in parallel. So yes.

I think that's it.

But instructions are "list every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." That means I must list only the ones explicitly marked as parallel-run tasks. Process B describes: tasks that can be executed in parallel: Step 2: (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines) and Step 4: (Quality_Check, Create_Documentation).

But wait, could it be interpreted that the tasks in step 2 are actually "may run simultaneously", so that pair is a pair of tasks. And in step 4 "begin in parallel" means that pair is a pair of tasks. So yes.

Thus output two lines. Now, instructions: "Return the pairs in alphabetical order". The ordering within each pair should be alphabetical. So pair one, if we decide to check with pair 1: Let me check alphabetical order ordering for pair: "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines" become: which is lexicographically? "Procure_Materials" has 'P' is 80. "Schedule_Machines": 'S' then so "Procure_Materials" would appear first, then "Schedule_Machines"? But then check: But then compare if the other tasks in pair 2: "Quality_Check" (starts with letter Q, 81? Actually Q = 81) and "Create_Documentation" starts with 'C' which is letter 67, so that spells out as "Create_Documentation" then "Quality_Check" in alphabetical order. And then overall ordering if we based on pairing then: letter ordering: "Create_Documentation" is C, and in pair 2 "Procure_Materials" is P. So "C" comes before "P", so pair with C gets listed before pair with P. So final sorted overall list:
1. Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
2. Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

But wait, we need to check instructions "return the pairs in alphabetical order, both *within* each pair and in your overall list." It might also mean that if we list pairs, we sort them lexicographically by concatenating the two tasks. The lexicographical order of the pair as whole sorted case, but each individual pair has been sorted. So given our two pairs, then compare the two tasks of each pair: for pair 1: "Create_Documentation" vs for pair 2: "Procure_Materials", first letter 'C' vs 'P'. So pair 1 is before pair 2. So final ordering: list:
Line: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check"
Line: "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"

I need exactly one pair per line.

Alright.

I have to be completely explicit that I ignore Process A.

Thus final answer:

I'll output:

Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

But wait, instruction says "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." Possibly means "alphabetical order when looking at all tasks names?" Possibly if there is any ambiguous order: could it be sorted by the tasks names? Then we need to list as follows:

Pair listing
From Step 2: after "Procure_Materials", "Schedule_Machines" : look at letters: "procure materials"? But our sorted order in that pair is: alphabetical of "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines." But then Step 4 pair: "Quality_Check" and "Create_Documentation", when sorted, becomes "Create_Documentation" then "Quality_Check".

Now then, overall list sorted by task name: "Create_Documentation", then "Procure_Materials", then "Quality_Check", then "Schedule_Machines" might appear in order if we combined? But the instruction "Return the pairs in alphabetical order" means that the pairs if there are more than one, all pair names should be listed sorted by alphabetical order, but then within each pair, the tasks names are in alphabetical order. So I think that's the proper reading.

So answer:
Line 1: Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Line 2: Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

One might ask: Should we output "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" with alphabetical order? But it's already sorted "Procure_Materials" is alphabetically if we compare letters "P" vs "S": in dictionary order, indeed P comes before S. But wait, but earlier we compared with another set: "Procure_Materials" vs "Schedule_Machines" if we compare the letters: "Procure_Materials" vs "Schedule_Machines" then "Procure_Materials" < "Schedule_Machines" because P < S. So yes, that pair is already sorted. So the overall sorted list then is lexicographically pairs: Compare the first tasks of each pair. For pair 1 sorted, the tasks are "Procure_Materials" (P) and for pair 2 sorted, the tasks are "Create_Documentation" (C). Since C comes before P, pair 2 is now placed before pair 1 if we sort overall by the alphabetical first element. But then overall alphabetical order should be if we list pairs, there may be an expected order if pair counts few. But let me re-read: "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." I might interpret that as: firstly, sort each pair alphabetically by each individual task name. Then the overall list of pairs should be sorted alphabetically by the first task name. Actually, alternate reading: "alphabetical order" means list the pairs such that the names on the left are in alphabetical order of the first letter of each pair disregarding if it is similar to the pair's names. There's potential ambiguity: There are only 2 pairs. Sorting them by which one appears first lexicographically? If so then "Create_Documentation" (C word) if put as the left element of the pair, will come before "Procure_Materials" (short letter P)? But then begs that the answer must be:
Line 1: Create_Documentation — Quality_Check (because "Create_Documentation" is alphabetically smaller than Procure_Materials, because letter C < letter P).
Line 2: Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines
So that is the overall sorting? But then wait, alphabetical order "within" each pair means that listing tasks from each pair, the tasks should be in alphabetical order and "in your overall list" might mean also sort the pairs relative to each other using alphabetical order of pair's combined names. I worry about if the order "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" sorted lexicographically is actually "Procure_Materials" vs "Schedule_Machines" check: "Procure" starts with P and "Schedule" starts with S, so that is sorted in each pair is correct. Now compare the pairs among themselves: one pair is "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" with left element "Procure_Materials", and the other pair is "Quality_Check — Create_Documentation", but sorted internally that should be "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" because that is the alphabetical order compared to "Quality_Check" vs "Create_Documentation"? Wait a minute: Which pair is (Quality_Check, Create_Documentation) if I sort them alphabetically: Compare "Create_Documentation" and "Quality_Check": I check letter "C" (67) vs letter "Q" (81), so it should be "Create_Documentation" then "Quality_Check". So that pair is now "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" with left element "Create_Documentation". Now then overall sorting: "Create_Documentation" vs "Procure_Materials": "C" (67) is less than "P" (80) because P is ASCII 80. So the pair with "Create_Documentation" appears before the pair with "Procure_Materials". So overall sorted order, pair list then begins with that pair instead. But then question: Did they want alphabetical overall list sorted by alphabetical order of the pair's names (i.e. as if they were string lists)? For clarity, I'll assume the sorted order is as I wrote.

Thus answer lines will be:
Line 1: Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Line 2: Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

But wait must check: Process B says "Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately after Create_Work_Order" should be read as parallel, but they do not necessarily complete at the same time. But it's explicitly mentioned "and may run simultaneously", so it's valid.

Double-check "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel right after Fabricate". Yes.

So answer: pairs: Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check, Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines. But then alphabetical overall ordering: ordering among these two is typically "Create_Documentation" is come first because "C" is less than "P". But then in process B, the pair listing "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" if we sort alphabetically within that pair, it should be "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" because "Procure" < "Schedule". However, if letters: "Schedule_Machines" is not alphabetical because letter S vs letter P; compare letter S with letter S? But I'm not sure.

I must check pair names precisely:
- "Procure_Materials" vs "Schedule_Machines": if sorted alphabetically by each letter: 'P' (80) vs 'S' (83) so left element is "Procure_Materials", then right element "Schedule_Machines" is second letter. So that pair is "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines".
- "Quality_Check" vs "Create_Documentation": if sorted alphabetically: letter 'C' vs letter 'Q'. In fact, "Create_Documentation" starts with "C", "Quality_Check" starts with "Q", so the sorted order is "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check".
Now overall both pairs sorted alphabetically by which task is first: Compare "Create_Documentation" (C) with "Procure_Materials" (P): Since C comes before P, then sorted order is: (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check), then (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines).
So overall list: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" then "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines".

But there is a consideration: Maybe when we refer "alphabetical order", it might mean that for each parallel pair, order the tasks by their name's letter order. But if that's the case, yes that is done.

Now, final result should be output as:
"Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"

However, double-check alphabetical sorting overall: Could it be that we might need to list pair as ("Procure_Materials", "Schedule_Machines") and then "Create_Documentation" and "Quality_Check" are not ordered because one pair might come out as: if you compare "Procure_Materials" to "Quality_Check", alphabetical order letter is "P" and "Q"? Actually, if we compare "Procure_Materials" to "Quality_Check" letter by letter: compare "P" vs "Q"? P (80) < Q (81) so "Procure_Materials" < "Quality_Check" means the second pair sorted alphabetically is "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines", if we consider the sorted pair with the lower alphabetical first element is "Procure_Materials" if that would come from that pair. But then the other pair, if we sorted that we got "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check", then "Create_Documentation" (C) < "Procure_Materials" (P)? Because C (67) is lowercase? Yes "C" is < "P". So then overall order becomes:

"Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and afterward "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines". But let me check if the instruction "alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list," it might indicate you need to sort the list by each pair's concatenated string if the pairs themselves are compared by the first letter of their left element. 

Maybe it's better to approach as: list all tasks that run in parallel, find the pairs. Then sort each pair lexicographically. Then sort the pairs lexicographically by their pair's elements (use a lexicographic sort on the pair as a tuple, e.g. min-first element, then second element). 

The pairs sorted individually:
Pair 1: (P, S) from "Procure_Materials" "Schedule_Machines"
Pair 2: (C, Q) from "Quality_Check" and "Create_Documentation", so sorted pair becomes (C, Q) so that would be "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" because "C" is alphabetical less than "Q".

Now sort by whole tuple: Compare (C, Q) vs (P, S): Compare C vs P: since C < P, so then (C, Q) pair goes first. So final overall sorted order is:
"(Create_Documentation — Quality_Check)"
"(Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines)"
Thus the overall list in this ordering is as above. 
But then wait! But then if I use the lexicographic sort on the entire process B parallel tasks, I might consider pair (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines): sorting them individually results in "Procure_Materials" then "Schedule_Machines" if that pair is left as is, then "Procure_Materials" (P) and "Schedule_Machines" (S) sorted tuple. And then, the pair (Quality_Check, Create_Documentation) sorted is "Create_Documentation" then "Quality_Check". Then compare (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines) and (Create_Documentation, Quality_Check) as tuples. But then alphabetically overall list: Check which tuple is lexicographically smallest? Compare first element of tuple pair: "Procure_Materials" starts with P, "Create_Documentation" starts with C. Since C is less than P, then the union sorted list is: 
- First: (Create_Documentation, Quality_Check) i.e. "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check"
- Second: (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines) i.e. "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines".
Thus, the overall sorted list in lexicographical order is as stated.

So final answer: 
Line 1: Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Line 2: Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines.

Double-check: Must list one pair per line.

I also need to check if tasks "Fabricate" parallel with anything? It says "Fabricate begins only after both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines are complete." So no parallelism there. And then "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin parallel right after Fabricate". So that's the second pair. So answer is complete.

I need to check: Some similar question was asked before: "List every pair" so that's all.

So final answer structure: I'll output exactly two lines: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" then "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines", following specified formatting using exactly "—  " in between and with each task left in alphabetical order.

I must print "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" as it is. But also note: The names "Procure_Materials" vs "Schedule_Machines" if sorted alphabetically, it should remain as is because they are in alphabetical order? But wait, "Procure_Materials" vs "Schedule_Machines": compare letters "P" vs "S": because "P" is letter 16 if you exclude A? Well, P is the 16th letter, S is the 19th letter. But yes, "Procure_Materials" is lexically before "Schedule_Machines"? Wait, check: Compare word "Procure" vs "Schedule", letter 'P'=16 which is before S=19, so indeed serialized correct? There's no mistake.

But in terms of typical ASCII ordering: 'P' (80) vs 'S' (83), but actually ASCII for uppercase letters: 'P' has code 80, 'S' has code 83; yes it does.

But wait, might need to check: "Create_Documentation" vs "Quality_Check": what's letter first? C equals ASCII 67, Q equals ASCII 81, so yes "Create_Documentation" is before "Quality_Check".

Thus overall pairs: 
( "Create_Documentation", "Quality_Check" ) and ( "Procure_Materials", "Schedule_Machines" ).

But then overall list alphabetical order: Now which pair will come first? If sorting them lexicographically on both pair members, then that pair whose first element is alphabetically smaller will be ordered first. So which pair's first element is alphabetically "Create_Documentation" (starting with C) or "Procure_Materials" (starting with P)? C is alphabetically less than P. So that pair should be listed first. So overall order: 
Line 1: Create_Documentation — Quality_Check 
Line 2: Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

Thus answer etc.

I can now produce answer. We'll produce line by line output:

"Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" then "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines".

I'll output exactly that. But wait, check "Quality_Check" list: "Quality_Check" then "Create_Documentation". But we already sorted it so that begins with "Create_Documentation" which is alphabetically earlier than "Quality_Check"? Yes.

But then wait, did we consider if tasks "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines" come in alphabetical order: "Procure_Materials" vs "Schedule_Machines", so pair should be "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines". But now overall sorting: That pair's left task is "Procure_Materials" which starts with "P", and the other pair's left task is "Create_Documentation" which starts with "C". So overall sorted order: To me, alphabetically highest is usually sorted by lower-case alphabetical order, so "C" comes first then "P".

Thus answer overall.

Double-check with ordering: We have two pairs: Sorted pair list combined: 
First compare: pair1: starts with "Create_Documentation" vs pair2: starts with "Procure_Materials": "C" is less than "P".
So final ordering: first output pair: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check". 
Then second: "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines".

I can now produce answer accordingly.

I'll now produce answer to System question: "List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above."

I must list just the pairs in Process B that can be executed in parallel, and ignore Process A. And then return the pairs in alphabetical order, and provide output one pair per line, using format: "Task_X  —  Task_Y".

I'll produce answer accordingly.

I'll produce plain text:
"Create_Documentation — Quality_Check"
"Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"

Now I'll produce my answer accordingly.Sort each parallel pair alphabetically, then sort the overall list by the left task. In Manufacturing_WorkOrder, the tasks run in parallel in two cases:

• In Step 2, Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines run simultaneously.
  Within the pair, alphabetical order gives Procure_Materials (P) then Schedule_Machines (S).

• In Step 4, Quality_Check and Create_Documentation run in parallel.
  Within the pair, alphabetical order gives Create_Documentation (C) then Quality_Check (Q) since C comes before Q.

Now, when sorting the two pairs overall by the first task in each pair:
  Pair (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check) comes before pair (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines) because “Create_Documentation” (starting with C) is alphabetically earlier than “Procure_Materials” (starting with P).

Thus, the final answer is:

Create_Documentation — Quality_Check  
Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines
