Non-compliant

**Justification:**

1.  **Violation of Rule 2:** The trace contains the activity `Expedite_Flag` (Event 4), which mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at Event 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at Event 9.
2.  **Violation of Rule 3:** The rule requires `Three_way_match` to be completed within the next two activities following `Goods_Received` (Event 6). This means `Three_way_match` should have occurred at Event 7 or Event 8. It actually occurred at Event 10, which is four steps later.
