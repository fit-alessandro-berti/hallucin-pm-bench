Let's analyze Process B â€“ Warehouse_Replenishment.

The process model contains two parallel constructs:

1. The first parallel construct (Parallel Split #1 and Merge #1) contains two tasks:
   - Quality_Check
   - Update_Inventory

These tasks can execute concurrently.

2. The second parallel construct (Parallel Split #2 and Merge #2) contains two tasks:
   - Generate_Replenishment_Report
   - Notify_Procurement

These tasks can also execute concurrently.

So, the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently in Process B are:

1. {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory}
2. {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}
