Looking at this XES event log fragment, I'll analyze each question systematically.

**Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

Scanning through the case attributes in all 10 events:
- C001 (appears in lines 1, 3, 7)
- C002 (appears in lines 2, 5, 8, 10)
- C003 (appears in lines 4, 6, 9)

**Answer: 3**

**Q2: For case "C002", list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred:**

Filtering events for case C002 and sorting by timestamp:
- Line 2: "Receive_Order" at 2025-03-01T09:15:10
- Line 5: "Check_Stock" at 2025-03-01T09:22:55
- Line 8: "Arrange_Delivery" at 2025-03-01T10:15:20
- Line 10: "Ship_Order" at 2025-03-01T10:25:40

**Answer: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

**Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order":**

Finding all occurrences of "Ship_Order":
- Line 7: C001 "Ship_Order" - preceded by line 3: C001 "Check_Stock"
- Line 9: C003 "Ship_Order" - preceded by line 6: C003 "Check_Stock"  
- Line 10: C002 "Ship_Order" - preceded by line 8: C002 "Arrange_Delivery"

Distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order":
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

**Answer:**
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
