4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   1. **Small Sample Size:** The fragment only contains 18 events from a single day (May 1, 2025), which is insufficient to generalize for an entire month.  
   2. **Time-Bias:** The data does not account for seasonal variations, weekdays vs. weekends, or anomalies (e.g., fraud checks may spike during holidays or promotions).  

**Note:** No assumptions are made beyond the given log lines.
