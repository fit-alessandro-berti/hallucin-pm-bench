To meet Orion Credit’s SLAs, the biggest performance gaps concentrate in three activities that combine material SLA breaches with the highest average waiting times. **Legal Approval** averages **900s** throughput versus a **600s** SLA (breach **+300s**) and has **600s** average waiting. **Risk Review** averages **600s** throughput versus a **300s** SLA (breach **+300s**) with **480s** average waiting. **Credit Assessment** averages **300s** throughput versus a **240s** SLA (breach **+60s**) with **200s** average waiting and the highest volume at **1,175 cases**, amplifying impact.

- **Legal Approval:** Reduce the **600s** average waiting time (two-thirds of the **900s** total) by adding scheduled review capacity during peaks for the **465 cases** reaching this step.  
- **Risk Review:** Cut the **480s** average waiting time by tightening routing into Risk Review; only **480 cases** enter this step versus **1,175** in Credit Assessment, indicating controllable inflow.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Lower the **200s** average waiting time by increasing assessment throughput capacity for the **1,175 cases** to recover the **+60s** SLA breach.
