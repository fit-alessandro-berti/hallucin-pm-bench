I cannot derive the average cycle time for “Review Contract” from the provided log because all timestamps and elapsed-time fields have been redacted. The header only shows the sequence of activities and resources, not their durations.

Explanation:
- To compute an average cycle time, we need start/end timestamps or per-activity durations for each “Review Contract” event.
- The historical benchmarks provided are for other activities and from a different segment; they cannot be used to infer “Review Contract” duration in this log.
