Okay, here are the decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process and the documents required for each decision:

1.  **Decision Point: Validate Eligibility**
    *   **Activity:** `Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility`
    *   **Decision:** Is the claim eligible based on the flight manifest and weather report?
    *   **Required Documents:**
        *   `RefundRequestForm` (submitted by the customer)
        *   `FlightManifest`
        *   `WeatherReport`

2.  **Decision Point: Pre-Approve Refund**
    *   **Activity:** `Finance_Controller_PreApprove`
    *   **Decision:** Is the validated claim pre-approved for refund?
    *   **Required Documents:**
        *   `EligibilityChecklist` (completed by the Finance Controller based on the validated claim information)

3.  **Decision Point: Determine if High-Value Review is Needed**
    *   **Activity:** This is an implicit decision point following `Finance_Controller_PreApprove`.
    *   **Decision:** Is the refund amount greater than €1,000?
    *   **Required Documents:**
        *   `RefundRequestForm` (to check the refund amount)

4.  **Decision Point: Senior Auditor Review Outcome (for high-value claims only)**
    *   **Activity:** `Senior_Auditor_Review`
    *   **Decision:** Is the high-value claim approved after senior audit?
    *   **Required Documents:**
        *   `AuditTrail`
        *   (Implicitly, the `RefundRequestForm` and `EligibilityChecklist` would also be reviewed)

5.  **Decision Point: Authorize Payment Execution**
    *   **Activity:** `Process_Refund_Payment` (the decision to proceed with payment based on conditions being met)
    *   **Decision:** Have all pre-requisites for payment (pre-approval, senior auditor review if applicable) been met, and is the bank transfer authorization signed?
    *   **Required Documents:**
        *   Signed `BankTransferAuthorization`
        *   (This step also depends on the successful completion of `Finance_Controller_PreApprove` and, if applicable, `Senior_Auditor_Review`)
