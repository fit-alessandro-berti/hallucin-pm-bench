**Executive Memo to Orionâ€™s COO**

Three activities exhibit severe performance gaps based on SLA breaches and high waiting times:

- **Risk Review**: Exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (600s vs. 300s target) with 480s waiting time. This is the largest breach, impacting 480 cases.
- **Legal Approval**: Exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (900s vs. 600s target) with 600s waiting time, affecting 465 cases.
- **Credit Assessment**: Exceeds SLA by 60 seconds (300s vs. 240s target) with 200s waiting time, impacting 1175 cases.

**Recommendations**:
- **Risk Review**: Reduce waiting time by reallocating resources to parallelize reviews, targeting a 50% reduction in idle time.
- **Legal Approval**: Implement a pre-approval checklist to streamline submissions, cutting waiting time by 30%.
- **Credit Assessment**: Automate data validation steps to reduce throughput time by 20s, aligning with SLA.

These actions address the most critical bottlenecks with measurable impact.
