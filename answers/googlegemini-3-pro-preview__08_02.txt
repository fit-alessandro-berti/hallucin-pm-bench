**Question 1.**
Yes.

**Question 2 (bonus).**
**Sequence:** T1, T2, T7, T4, T5

**Explanation:**
Transition T1 places tokens in both P1 and P2. T5 requires inputs {P2, P5}. To enable T5, we must generate a token for P5 while preserving the token in P2. Firing T3 would consume P2, making T5 impossible. Instead, we traverse the upper branch: T2 and T7 produce a token in P4. T4 consumes P4 to produce P5. At this stage, we hold tokens in {P2, P5}, allowing T5 to fire without ever invoking T3.
