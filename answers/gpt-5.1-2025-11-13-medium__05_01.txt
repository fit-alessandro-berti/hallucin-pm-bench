Introduce an interrupting boundary timer event on **Task_RequestDocs (id="Task_RequestDocs")**.

Configure the timer (e.g., `Timer_48h`) with `timeDuration="PT48H"` (or an equivalent expression measured from `Start_Claim`) and connect its outgoing sequence flow directly to **Task_Triage (id="Task_Triage")**.

Behavior:
- If missing documents are provided in time, `Task_RequestDocs` completes normally and flow continues via `f6` to `Task_Triage`.
- If `Task_RequestDocs` is still active when the 48‑hour timer fires, the boundary event triggers, interrupting the task and immediately routing the claim to `Task_Triage`, effectively auto‑escalating.

No new tasks are introduced; only events and flows are adjusted.
