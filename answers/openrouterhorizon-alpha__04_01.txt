Non-compliant
1) Violates Rule 2: With Expedite_Flag present, Risk_Assessment must occur before the first Ship_Goods. In the trace, Ship_Goods (event 8) occurs before Risk_Assessment (event 9).
2) Complies with Rule 1: PO amount > â‚¬10,000; two approvals (Procurement Officer at event 2 and CFO at event 3) occur before Issue_PO (event 5).
3) Complies with Rule 3: Three_way_match (event 10) occurs within two activities after Goods_Received (event 6); specifically at distance 4, but the rule requires within the next two activities after Goods_Received. Correction: This actually violates Rule 3 because Three_way_match occurs at event 10, which is four steps after event 6, exceeding the allowed distance of 2.
4) Complies with Rule 4: No Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity (CFO at event 3 is followed by System at event 4).
5) Complies with Rule 5: Trace ends with Archive_Record (event 11) and nothing follows it.
