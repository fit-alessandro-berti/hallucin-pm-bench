The claim is **not accurate**.  

From the event-log fragment:  

- **Case 1001**: `Update_Inventory` (08:25:55) occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund` (08:30:02), not after.  
- **Case 1002**: There is **no** `Update_Inventory` at all.  
- **Case 1003**: `Update_Inventory` (10:08:07) occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund` (10:22:18), with `Quality_Check` in between; they are not immediately consecutive, and the order is reversed from the claim.

Therefore, in no case does `Authorize_Refund` occur immediately before `Update_Inventory`; the observed order is the opposite when both are present.
