1. No.  

2. For example, in case C002 the sequence is Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment (so “Validate_Payment” does not immediately follow “Receive_Order”). Similarly, in case C004 the sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment. Hence “Validate_Payment” does not always occur right after “Receive_Order.”
