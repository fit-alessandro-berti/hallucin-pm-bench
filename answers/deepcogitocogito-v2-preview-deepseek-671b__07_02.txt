I need to analyze the two BPMN XML documents and identify all changes, grouping them under the three specified categories. Let me systematically compare them.

First, I'll compare the task elements to see what's been added and removed.

**Task Comparison:**
- v1 Tasks: Review Application, Approve Loan, Reject Loan
- v2 Tasks: Verify Identity, Review Application, Auto-Approve Loan, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject

Now, let's look at the mandatory headings:

1. **Added tasks:**
   - "Verify Identity" is a new task at the start
   - "Auto-Approve Loan" is a modification of "Approve Loan" but due to changed ID and name, it's effectively new
   - "Request Additional Documents" is a completely new task
   - "Final Reject" is a new task replacing "Reject Loan" (different ID and name)

2. **Removed tasks:**
   - "Approve Loan" (replaced by "Auto-Approve Loan")
   - "Reject Loan" (replaced by "Final Reject")

3. **Gateway-type changes:**
   - Changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway (id="Gateway_Decision")
   - Gateway name changed from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check"
   - The outgoing flows changed from two paths with "yes/no" conditions to three paths with "eligible", "missing docs", and "ineligible"

Flow changes (though not directly requested) show the structural impact:
- Added verification step at the beginning
- Changed the decision gateway to have three outcomes
- All process paths now converge to a single end event

Note: We're ignoring purely cosmetic changes and focus on functional changes as per instructions.
• **Added tasks**  
1. *Verify Identity* (id="Task_VerifyIdentity") - New initial task  
2. *Request Additional Documents* (id="Task_RequestDocs") - New parallel path  
3. *Auto-Approve Loan* (id="Task_ApproveLoan") - New main approval path  
4. *Final Reject* (id="Task_FinalReject") - New rejection endpoint  

• **Removed tasks**  
1. The original *Approve Loan* (id="Task_ApproveLoan") - Replaced by Auto-Approve version  
2. *Reject Loan* (id="Task_RejectLoan") - Removed in favor of Final Reject  

• **Gateway-type changes**  
1. *Gateway_Decision* changed from **Exclusive Gateway** (XOR) to **Inclusive Gateway** (OR)  
2. Renamed from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check"  
3. Modified condition paths:  
   - Original 2 paths ("yes"/"no")  
   - Now 3 paths: "eligible", "missing docs", "ineligible"
