**No**. In case C003 (lines 6-7), Validate_Payment occurs first (line 6) before Receive_Order (line 7), violating the "always follows" condition. Similarly, in case C005 (lines 11-12), Validate_Payment (line 11) precedes Cancel_Order (line 12) with no prior Receive_Order in the case. While Validate_Payment follows Receive_Order in cases C001 (lines 1-2), C002 (lines 3 and 5), and C004 (lines 8-9), the counterexamples in C003 and C005 disprove the claim that it *always* does so.
