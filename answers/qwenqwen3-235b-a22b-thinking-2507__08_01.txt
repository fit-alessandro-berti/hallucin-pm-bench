**Answer:**  
Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.  

**Concrete Firing Sequence:**  
Initial marking → **T1** → **T2** → **T5**.  

**Step-by-Step Justification:**  
1. **Initial marking**: `[p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0]`.  
2. **Fire T1** (parallel split): Consumes `p0`, produces `p1` and `p2`.  
   → Marking: `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.  
3. **Fire T2**: Consumes `p1`, produces `p3`.  
   → Marking: `[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`.  
   - At this point:  
     - `p3 = 1` (required for T5’s normal arc),  
     - `p4 = 0` (satisfies T5’s inhibitor arc condition).  
4. **Fire T5**: Enabled since `p3 ≥ 1` and `p4 = 0`. Consumes `p3`, produces `p6`.  
   → Marking: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.  
   - **T3 has not fired yet** (still enabled due to `p2=1`, but not executed).  

**Conclusion**:  
T5 fires **before T3** in this sequence. The key is that after T2 fires, `p4` remains empty until T3 executes, allowing T5 to fire immediately while `p4 = 0`. This satisfies the inhibitor arc condition for T5 without requiring T3 to fire first.  

**Proof Sketch for Validity**:  
- T5’s enabling condition (`p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0`) is met after T1→T2 (since T3 has not yet consumed `p2` to produce `p4`).  
- No structural constraints force T3 to fire before T5; the net allows interleaving of T2→T5 or T2→T3.  
- Thus, T5 firing before T3 is reachable and valid.
