As an expert on Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process, here is the summary of decision points and the enumeration of all required documents.

## Decision Points in Contoso’s Flight-Refund Process

The process contains one explicit decision point based on the refund amount:

1.  **Decision based on Refund Amount (Implicit in step 4):**
    *   **Condition:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1 000**?
    *   **Path A (Yes/High-Value):** The case proceeds to **Senior\_Auditor\_Review**.
    *   **Path B (No/Standard-Value):** The case bypasses **Senior\_Auditor\_Review** and proceeds directly to **Process\_Refund\_Payment** (after **Finance\_Controller\_PreApprove**).
