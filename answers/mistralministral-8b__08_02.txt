**Question 1:** Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**. This can happen if the marking reaches a state where **P2** and **P5** are both marked, allowing **T5** to fire even before **T3** has had a chance to fire.

**Question 2:** One minimal firing sequence demonstrating this is: [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]. This sequence reaches a state where **P2** and **P5** are both marked, allowing **T5** to fire before **T3**.
