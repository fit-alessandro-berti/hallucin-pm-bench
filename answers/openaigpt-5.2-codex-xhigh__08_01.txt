**Yes.**  
Because after the split \(T1\), \(T2\) and \(T3\) are concurrent. If we fire \(T2\) first, \(p4\) is still empty, so the inhibitor arc does **not** block \(T5\).

**Example firing sequence (from the initial marking):**

1. **\(T1\)**: \(p0 \to p1+p2\)  
   \(M_1:\ p1=1,\ p2=1\)

2. **\(T2\)**: \(p1 \to p3\)  
   \(M_2:\ p3=1,\ p2=1,\ p4=0\)

3. **\(T5\)**: enabled because \(p3=1\) and \(p4=0\)  
   \(M_3:\ p6=1,\ p2=1\)

Here \(T5\) fired **before** \(T3\).  
(\(T3\) can still fire later from \(p2\), but \(T5\) already occurred.)
