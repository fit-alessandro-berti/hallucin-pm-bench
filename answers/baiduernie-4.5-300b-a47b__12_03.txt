1. No  
2. The FACT is inaccurate because:  
   - **CaseID C001**: *Receive_Order* (09:12:00) → *Validate_Payment* (09:15:00) is immediate, but this is not universal.  
   - **CaseID C002**: *Receive_Order* (09:30:00) → *Pack_Items* (09:50:00) → *Validate_Payment* (10:05:00). Here, *Validate_Payment* occurs **after** *Pack_Items*, not immediately.  
   - **CaseID C004**: *Receive_Order* (10:05:00) → *Check_Fraud* (10:07:00) → *Validate_Payment* (10:20:00). Again, *Validate_Payment* is not immediately after *Receive_Order*.  
   Thus, the FACT fails for **C002** and **C004**.
