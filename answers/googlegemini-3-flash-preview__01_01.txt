Based on the process description provided for Contoso Airlines, here are the decision points and the required documents:

### **Decision Points**
1.  **Eligibility Validation (Triage Agent):** The triage agent determines if the claim is valid based on flight status and external conditions.
2.  **Financial Pre-Approval (Finance Controller):** The controller decides whether to sign off on the claim for further processing.
3.  **Value Threshold Routing (System/Process Logic):** A branch occurs based on the refund amount. If the amount is **greater than €1,000**, it triggers an additional review; if not, it proceeds toward payment.
4.  **Audit Review (Senior Auditor):** For high-value claims, the auditor must determine if the claim passes a final inspection before payment is authorized.
