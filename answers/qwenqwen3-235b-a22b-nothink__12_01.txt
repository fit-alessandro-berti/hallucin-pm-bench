The Fact is **not accurate**.  

**Key evidence:**  
- **Case 1001**: Activity sequence is **Update_Inventory (08:25:55)** followed by **Authorize_Refund (08:30:02)**, directly contradicting the claim that "Authorize_Refund *always* occurs immediately before Update_Inventory."  
- **Case 1003**: **Update_Inventory (10:08:07)** is followed by **Quality_Check (10:15:42)** and **then** Authorize_Refund (10:22:18), which also violates the proposed order.  

**Conclusion**: The event log shows two instances where Authorize_Refund does **not** immediately precede Update_Inventory, invalidating the claim.  

Answer: **No, the fact is inaccurate** (see justification above).
