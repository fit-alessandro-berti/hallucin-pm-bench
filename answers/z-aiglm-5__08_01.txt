**Answer: Yes.**

It is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Concrete Firing Sequence:**
**T1 → T2 → T5**

**Justification:**

1.  **Start (Initial Marking):** The net begins with a token in **p0**.
    *   Marking: $M_0 = [p0:1, p1:0, p2:0, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0]$

2.  **Fire T1:** Transition T1 is enabled (p0 has a token). Firing T1 consumes the token from p0 and produces one token in p1 and one in p2 (parallel split).
    *   Marking: $M_1 = [p0:0, p1:1, p2:1, p3:0, p4:0, \dots]$

3.  **Fire T2:** Transition T2 is enabled (p1 has a token). Firing T2 consumes the token from p1 and produces one token in p3.
    *   Note: At this stage, the token in p2 (from step 2) has not yet moved. Therefore, **p4 is still empty**.
    *   Marking: $M_2 = [p0:0, p1:0, p2:1, p3:1, p4:0, \dots]$

4.  **Fire T5:** We check the enabling conditions for T5:
    *   **Normal input (p3):** Required $\ge 1$. Currently $p3=1$. (Satisfied)
    *   **Inhibitor input (p4):** Required $= 0$. Currently $p4=0$. (Satisfied)
    
    Since T5 is enabled, it fires. It consumes the token from p3 and produces a token in p6. T3 (which requires a token from p2) has not fired yet.
    
    *Result:* T5 has successfully fired before T3.

**Summary:** For T5 to fire, place p4 must be empty. Since p4 is filled exclusively by T3, T5 can only fire if T3 has not yet fired. The sequence T1→T2 puts a token in p3 while leaving p4 empty, creating the exact conditions required for T5 to fire before T3.
