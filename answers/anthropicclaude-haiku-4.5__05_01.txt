**Suggested Improvement:**

Add a **boundary timer event** on `Task_Check` (id: `Task_Check`) set to **48 hours**. When the timer fires, it should trigger an **escalation end event** that bypasses the document completeness check and sends the claim directly to `Task_Triage` (via a new sequence flow from the timer event to `Task_Triage`).

This ensures that even if documentation is incomplete or the check is delayed, the claim automatically reaches Triage within the 48-hour SLA window. The timer acts as a safety net without adding new tasksâ€”only a timer boundary event and a reconnection of flow logic.

This prevents bottlenecks at `Task_Check` or `Task_RequestDocs` from violating the SLA.
