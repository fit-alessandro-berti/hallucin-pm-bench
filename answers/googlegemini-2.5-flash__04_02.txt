Here's the compliance analysis for case #47291:

**R1.** Any purchase order with **total_amount > €10 000** must have **Manager_Approval** *followed by* **Finance_Approval**.
*   **Compliant.** PO amount > €10k, and Manager Approval was followed by Finance Approval.

**R2.** If **expedited = true**, **Ship_Goods** must occur **within 2 calendar days after the last required approval**.
*   **Violated.** Ship_Goods (Mar 5) occurred before the new Manager_Approval (Mar 7) required by R5, hence not "after last required approval".

**R3.** **Pay_Invoice** must never occur **before** **Receive_Goods**.
*   **Violated.** Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) occurred before Receive_Goods (2025-03-07).

**R4.** If **hazardous = true**, a **Safety_Inspection** must occur **after Receive_Goods and before Store_Goods**.
*   **Not Applicable.** The condition 'hazardous = true' was not met for this purchase order.

**R5.** If a **Change_Request** happens **after any approval**, the purchase order must obtain a **new Manager_Approval before any further processing step**.
*   **Violated.** Ship_Goods, Receive_Goods, and Pay_Invoice occurred before new Manager_Approval after Change_Request.

**R6.** Every case must terminate with **Archive_Record**.
*   **Compliant.** The event trace correctly terminated with the Archive_Record activity.
