**Re:** Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Remediation  

1. **Request_Documents** (Worst)  
   - Avg Wait: 36.5h | 95th Pctl: 120.0h  
   → *Action: Automate document-acknowledgment tracking and alert assignees if no response within 24h.*  

2. **Send_Closure_Letter**  
   - Avg Wait: 12.2h | 95th Pctl: 44.0h  
   → *Action: Implement pre-approved template routing with auto-trigger on claim closure.*  

3. **Assess_Liability**  
   - Avg Wait: 7.8h | 95th Pctl: 16.4h  
   → *Action: Introduce mandatory case triage to assign complex claims to senior assessors within 4h of intake.*  

Each measure targets ≥20% wait-time reduction by eliminating process delays, not service effort.  

*All recommendations prioritize waiting-time efficiency based solely on observed bottlenecks.*
