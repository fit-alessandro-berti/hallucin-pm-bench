Here are the answers based on the provided log data:

1.  The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in the excerpt.

2.  Percentage of:
    a) all *events*: (1 / 48) * 100 = **2.08%**
    b) all *unique cases*: (1 / 12) * 100 = **8.33%**

3.  Such a low-support activity (occurring only once) offers an extremely limited sample. In performance analysis, it's impossible to derive meaningful statistics like average duration or identify bottlenecks, as any calculation is based on a single data point, making it unrepresentative. For predictive models, this lack of data means the model cannot learn patterns associated with this activity, leading to poor prediction accuracy or bias. Generalizing from this tiny slice risks misrepresenting the true process behavior or outcomes when this activity naturally occurs with higher frequency in larger datasets.
