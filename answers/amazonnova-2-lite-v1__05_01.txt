Add a **timer start event** on **Task_Triage** with a 48-hour duration, triggering an **escalation event** if **Task_Triage** isn’t reached by then. Connect this escalation to an existing path, perhaps via a new **intermediate escalation event** linked to **f7**. This ensures claims auto-escalate without new tasks, leveraging current flows and meeting the SLA by pressuring timely progression from **Task_Check** through **GW_Docs** to **Task_Triage**.
