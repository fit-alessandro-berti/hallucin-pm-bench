RE: Critical Performance Issues in Credit Processing

Analysis of our credit processing pipeline reveals three activities requiring immediate intervention based on SLA breaches and excessive waiting times.

**Legal Approval** shows the most severe performance degradation, with average throughput time of 900 seconds against a 300-second SLA target (200% over). The 600-second waiting time represents 67% of total processing time.

**Risk Review** exceeds its 300-second SLA by 100%, reaching 600 seconds throughput time. Waiting time of 480 seconds accounts for 80% of the activity duration.

**Credit Assessment** breaches its 240-second SLA by 25%, with 300 seconds throughput time. The 200-second waiting time constitutes 67% of processing time.

**Recommendations:**
• Legal Approval: Implement parallel review lanes to reduce the 600-second queue time
• Risk Review: Add processing capacity to address the 480-second bottleneck affecting 480 cases
• Credit Assessment: Automate preliminary checks to reduce the 200-second wait affecting 1,175 cases
