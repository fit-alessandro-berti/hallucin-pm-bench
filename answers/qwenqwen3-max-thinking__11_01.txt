**Subject:** Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Actions  

Analysis of 12-month claims data identifies these waiting-time laggards:  

1. **Request_Documents**: Avg = 36.5h (95p = 120.0h)  
   → *Action:* Automate document request triggers upon Initial_Screening completion to eliminate manual handoffs.  

2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg = 12.2h (95p = 44.0h)  
   → *Action:* Integrate closure-letter generation into the Approve_Payment/Reject_Claim decision step for immediate dispatch.  

3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg = 7.8h (95p = 16.4h)  
   → *Action:* Pre-load claim context (e.g., incident reports, policy terms) into assessors’ worklists before task assignment.  

Each action targets ≥20% waiting-time reduction by removing handoff delays or enabling parallel prep.
