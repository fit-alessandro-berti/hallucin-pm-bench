Based on the provided event log data, it is not possible to calculate the average cycle time for the "Review Contract" activity.

**Explanation:**

The event log contains only the sequence of activities (activity names) and the resources who performed them. To calculate the cycle time (i.e., the duration) of an activity, the log would need to include either:
*   Individual start and end timestamps for each activity, or
*   A pre-calculated "elapsed-time" field for each activity row.

Since the prompt states that "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted," the necessary data to perform the requested calculation is unavailable. The provided historical benchmarks for other activities are from a different source and cannot be used to infer the duration of "Review Contract" in this specific log.
