**Added XML elements** to enforce the 48-hour SLA using a boundary timer event that escalates to the existing Account Manager review:

```xml
<bpmn:boundaryEvent id="Timer_48h" attachedToRef="Activity_CreateAccount">
  <bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
    <bpmn:timeDuration>P2D</bpmn:timeDuration>
  </bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
</bpmn:boundaryEvent>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_Timer" sourceRef="Timer_48h" targetRef="Activity_AMReview"/>
```

**Justification**: Added a 48-hour boundary timer to "Create Account" that routes to the existing (but previously unused) Account Manager review activity when the SLA is breached, leveraging already-available elements to enforce the time constraint.
