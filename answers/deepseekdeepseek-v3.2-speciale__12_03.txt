**Answer:** No

**Justification:**  
- In Case C002, the activity order is `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment`. The immediate successor of `Receive_Order` is `Pack_Items`, not `Validate_Payment`.  
- In Case C004, the order is `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment`. Here, `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.  

These two cases violate the claim that "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between."
