**2.** (≤ 120 words)  
An analyst looking only at this excerpt sees just a handful of cases, and only one instance of “Manual Fraud Check.” Such a tiny sample can be highly unrepresentative: the few displayed cases may be early or atypical, and later cases could contain many more manual checks. Consequently, the analyst might conclude the activity is rare, even though the complete month‑long log could have a different frequency. The risk is sampling bias and incomplete visibility of the full process.
