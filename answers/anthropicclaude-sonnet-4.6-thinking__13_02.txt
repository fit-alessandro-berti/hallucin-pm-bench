### 2. Percentages

| Denominator | Calculation | Result |
|---|---|---|
| a) All events (48) | 1 ÷ 48 × 100 | **2.08%** |
| b) All unique cases (12) | 1 ÷ 12 × 100 | **8.33%** |

### 3. Risk of Generalising from a Low-Support Activity (≤100 words)

With only **one observed instance**, any metric derived from `Manual_Fraud_Check` — its typical duration, its probability of triggering an approval vs. rejection, or its effect on overall cycle time — carries virtually no statistical reliability. A predictive model trained on this slice will either ignore the activity entirely (too rare to learn from) or overfit to the single case (C05, which ended in `Approve_Payout`). The log slice cannot reveal whether manual checks correlate with fraud, longer processing, or specific claim types. Conclusions drawn here would not generalise to the full population without substantially more data on this variant.
