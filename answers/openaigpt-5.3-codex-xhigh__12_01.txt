No — the fact is **not accurate** for this log fragment.

Relevant cases:

- **Case 1001:** `Update_Inventory` → `Authorize_Refund` (so `Authorize_Refund` is **after**, not before).
- **Case 1003:** `Update_Inventory` → `Quality_Check` → `Authorize_Refund` (again `Authorize_Refund` is after, and not adjacent).
- **Case 1002:** `Authorize_Refund` occurs, but there is **no** `Update_Inventory`.

So in this fragment, `Authorize_Refund` is **never immediately before** `Update_Inventory`.
