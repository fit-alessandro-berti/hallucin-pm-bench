1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **once** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ This excerpt contains only 3 cases (1001, 1002, 1003) from what appears to be a month-long process. The limited sample size prevents accurate estimation of frequency in the full dataset. Case 1001 used "Automatic Fraud Check," while Case 1002 used "Manual Fraud Check." Without seeing hundreds or thousands of cases, we cannot determine if this 1 occurrence represents typical frequency or if it's an outlier. The full log might show different patterns across cases, time periods, or departments that aren't visible in this small snippet. Additionally, the excerpt doesn't show rejected cases or parallel processes that might affect manual fraud check rates.
