**1.** The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in the provided excerpt (CaseID 1002, 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).

**2.** This excerpt contains only **3 cases** from a single day (March 1) of a month-long log. The single occurrence of “Manual Fraud Check” in this tiny sample (33% case prevalence here) is not statistically representative. The full log likely contains hundreds or thousands of cases distributed across all 31 days. Manual fraud checks may be triggered by specific risk rules that apply to only a subset of applications (e.g., high-value loans, certain applicant characteristics). Without observing the complete distribution of case attributes and the full temporal spread, an analyst cannot determine if this 1-in-3 ratio reflects the true monthly frequency or is an anomaly from a low-volume day. The sample size is far too small to generalize.
