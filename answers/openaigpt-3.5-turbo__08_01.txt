Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in this Petri net.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking to achieve this is:
1. T1 fires, removing the token from p0 and adding tokens to p1 and p2.
2. T2 fires, moving the token from p1 to p3.
3. T5 fires, because p4 contains zero tokens (inhibitor arc), moving the tokens from p3 to p6.

Therefore, T5 can fire before T3 in this Petri net.
