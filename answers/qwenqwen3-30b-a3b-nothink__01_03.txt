**a) Summary of every decision point (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process:**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check Decision Point**:  
   - The risk rating is determined based on the combination of the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow), resulting in either a Low, Medium, or High risk outcome.

2. **Conditional Branch: Skip Manual-Underwriting-Review**  
   - If the risk rating is Low or Medium **and** the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, then step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review) is skipped.

3. **Decision-Gate “TriVote”**  
   - A loan application is approved only if at least **two out of three** required reviewers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) provide their approval.
