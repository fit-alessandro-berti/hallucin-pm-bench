# Compliance Assessment for Trace 2025-05-RX17

**Answer: No**

The trace is not compliant with ruleset R. Here's my assessment of each rule:

**Rule 1:** SATISFIED - Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occur exactly once each and in the correct order (QE is at position 3, RA at position 5).

**Rule 2:** SATISFIED - For this "High" severity case, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) happens at position 6, which is after both QE and RA as required.

**Rule 3:** VIOLATED - `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs at position 4, which is after QE but before RA is complete. The rule specifically requires NA to occur only after both QE and RA are complete.

**Rule 4:** SATISFIED - `Close_Case` (CC) occurs at position 7, which is after NA and after VP (as required for this high-severity case).

Since Rule 3 is violated, the trace is non-compliant with ruleset R.
