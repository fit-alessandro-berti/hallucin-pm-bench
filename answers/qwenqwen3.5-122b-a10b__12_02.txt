The claim is inaccurate because Case C003 records *Validate_Payment* at Line 6 occurring before *Receive_Order* at Line 7, which violates the asserted sequence where payment validation must come after order receipt. Additionally, Case C005 begins with *Validate_Payment* at Line 11 without any preceding *Receive_Order* event in the provided fragment, further disproving the assertion that this activity always follows the order receipt.
