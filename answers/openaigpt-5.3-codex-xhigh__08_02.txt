**Q1:** **Yes**, \(T5\) can fire before \(T3\).

\(T5\) needs tokens in \(P2\) and \(P5\).  
After \(T1\), \(P2\) already has a token. \(P5\) can be produced **without \(T3\)** via the other branch:
\(P1 \xrightarrow{T2} P3 \xrightarrow{T7} P4 \xrightarrow{T4} P5\).

So \(T3\) is not a causal predecessor of \(T5\).

**Q2 (minimal sequence):**  
\[
[T1,\; T2,\; T7,\; T4,\; T5]
\]
Markings:
\(\{P0\}\to\{P1,P2\}\to\{P3,P2\}\to\{P4,P2\}\to\{P5,P2\}\to\{P6\}\).

Here, \(T5\) fires and \(T3\) has not fired.
