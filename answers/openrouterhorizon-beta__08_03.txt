Yes.

Shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3:
T1, T2b, T4, T5

Explanation:
- T1 produces tokens in pa and pb.
- T2b consumes pa and puts a token in pd (skipping pc and hence T3).
- T4 consumes pb and puts a token in pe.
- With tokens now in both pd and pe, T5 can fire before any firing of T3.
