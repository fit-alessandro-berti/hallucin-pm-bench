### Answer:
**No**

### Justification:
The trace violates Rule 3 of the ruleset R. Below is a detailed breakdown of each rule's compliance status:

- **Rule 1**: Satisfied.  
  Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occur once each, and in the required order (QE at position 3, RA at position 5, so QE comes before RA).

- **Rule 2**: Satisfied.  
  Since the case attribute `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must occur after both QE and RA. VP (position 6) happens after QE (position 3) and RA (position 5), so this rule is met.

- **Rule 3**: Violated.  
  `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until after both QE and RA are complete. In the trace, NA (position 4) occurs after QE (position 3) but before RA (position 5), meaning RA is incomplete when NA happens. This violates the requirement that both reviews must be finished before NA can occur.

- **Rule 4**: Satisfied.  
  `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only after NA and, if severity is "High", after VP. CC (position 7) occurs after NA (position 4) and VP (position 6), satisfying this rule.

The violation of Rule 3 makes the entire trace non-compliant with ruleset R.
