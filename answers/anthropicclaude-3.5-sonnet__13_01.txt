Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs exactly 1 time in this fragment.

2. Total number of events = 18
Number of Manual_Fraud_Check = 1
Percentage = (1/18) Ã— 100 = 5.56%

3. "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears only in case A1002.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why using this fragment for monthly estimates would be unreliable:
   - Temporal coverage: The fragment only shows events from a single day (May 1, 2025), which is not representative of an entire month's patterns
   - Sample size: With only 4 cases (A1001-A1004), this is too small a sample to make reliable statistical inferences about the broader population of orders and their fraud check frequencies
