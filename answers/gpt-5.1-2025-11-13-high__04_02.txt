R1: Compliant – PO amount > €10k has Manager_Approval then later Finance_Approval; sequence and presence satisfied.  

R2: Violated – Expedited order; shipment happens before the required post-change Manager_Approval, so not within two days after last approval.  

R3: Violated – Pay_Invoice on 2025-03-06 occurs before Receive_Goods on 2025-03-07, violating required ordering.  

R4: Not Applicable – PO marked hazardous = false, so no Safety_Inspection requirement applies.  

R5: Violated – Change_Request occurs after Finance_Approval; subsequent Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice happen before new Manager_Approval, breaching “before further processing” clause.  

R6: Compliant – Case ends with Archive_Record as final event, satisfying termination requirement.
