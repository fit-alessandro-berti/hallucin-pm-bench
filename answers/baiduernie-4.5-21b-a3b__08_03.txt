### Step 1: Analyze the net structure and the given initial marking
We start with the initial marking $(p0 = 1,pa = pb=pc = pd=pe = pf = 0)$. The net has a parallel - split at $T1$ where Marking 1 is $(p0 = 0,pa=1,pb = pc=pd = pe=pf = 0)$ after $T1$ fires.

### Step 2: Determine the possible predecessors and successors of $T3$ and $T5$
- **Predecessors of $T3$**: The only transition that can fire and reach $T3$'s input place $pc$ is $T2$ or $T2b$. When $T2$ fires, we get to Marking 2 $(p0 = 0,pa=0,pb = pc = pd=pe = 0, pb=1)$) and then $T3$ can fire, resulting in Marking 3 $(p0 = 0,pa=0,pb = 0,pc = 0,pd = 1,pe = 0,pf = 0)$
- **Predecessors of $T5$**: $T5$ can fire when both $pd$ and $pe$ have tokens. $T3$ and $T4$ can both contribute tokens to $pd$ and $pe$ respectively. To get $T5$ to fire before $T3$, we need to violate the sequential dependencies in the net.

### Step 3: Check if $T5$ can fire before $T3$
The net has a feedback loop through $T6$. However, to reach the marking where $T5$ can fire ($\text{ReachableTokens}(pd)\cap\text{ReachableTokens}(pe)\neq\varnothing$), we first need to fire the transitions that lead to $pd$ and $pe$. $T2$ is used to get a token to $pc$ for $T3$ and $T4$ is used to get a token to $pe$ for the next step towards $T5$.

We cannot make $T5$ fire before $T3$ because $T3$ is dependent on $pc$, which is populated either by $T2$ or $T2b$. And we need to fire all the necessary transitions to make the tokens in $pd$ and $pe$ available for $T5$ to fire. If we try to fire $T5$ first, we will not have the tokens in the required places ($pd$ and $pe$) to enable $T5$ to fire.

### Formal explanation
The net is a directed acyclic graph (in terms of the firing sequence based on the input - output dependencies between transitions) in a sense that the transitions have a certain sequential order. $T3$ requires a token in $pc$ to fire, and $pc$ is populated by $T2$ or $T2b$. For $T5$ to fire, it needs tokens in $pd$ and $pe$. The transitions $T2$ and $T4$ are necessary to build up the tokens in $pd$ and $pe$ from the initial token in $p0$. Fr there to be a firing sequence where $T5$ fires before $T3$, we would need to violate these sequential dependencies in the net structure, which is not possible.

**Answer**: No, it is not possible for transition $T5$ to fire before transition $T3$ in any reachable marking.
