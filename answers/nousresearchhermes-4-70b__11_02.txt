**Memo To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** Q1 2025  
**Subject:** Claims Handling Process Performance Review  

This memo highlights critical performance issues in Q1 2025. Based on the attached dashboard:  

1. **Request Documents**: This is the worst-performing activity, with an alarming **150-minute average queue time** and **22% rework rate**â€”the highest in the process.  
2. **Review Documents**: Follows closely, with a **12.4% SLA breach rate** (second-highest) and **30-minute average queue time**, indicating severe delays.  
3. **Calculate Payout**: Charts third due to a **9-minute standard deviation in processing time** (also second-highest), signaling significant variability and a **1.2% SLA breach rate**.  

**Immediate actions**:  
- For *Request Documents*, implement a triage system to prioritize clear cases and reduce rework.  
- For *Review Documents*, cross-train staff to address bottlenecks and explore AI-assisted document screening.  
- For *Calculate Payout*, standardize calculation rules to lower processing variability.  

These steps should mitigate delays and variability based on current data.
