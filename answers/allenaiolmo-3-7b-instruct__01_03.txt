**a) Decision Points in Acme Bank’s Loan Approval Process**

1. **Step 3 Tri-Color-Risk-Check Decision:**  
   *If the combined risk score from the three color-scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) falls in the Low or Medium range, proceed; if High, the application is automatically rejected (since only Low/Medium with a cap amount allows skipping the manual review).*

2. **Step 4 Amount Cap Check:**  
   *If the risk is Low or Medium AND the requested amount is €250,000 or less, skip the Manual Underwriting Review (Step 5) and go directly to the Decision Gate.*

3. **Step 5 Manual Underwriting Review (Conditional):**  
   *If risk is High or requested amount > €250,000 (i.e., only High risk or large loan amounts reach here), proceed to the manual review by the Deck Officer ( documented in the Deck Memo).*

4. **Step 6 TriVote Decision Gate:**  
   *The loan is approved if at least two out of three decision-makers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve the loan; otherwise, it is rejected.*

5. **Step 8 Applicant Confirmation:**  
   *If the TriVote passes, the applicant must confirm acceptance of the Offer Sheet 77 and sign the ID Matrix Declaration; failure to do so results in rejection.*

6. **Step 9 Finalize Agreement:**  
   *If all prior steps are passed and confirmation is received, the Loan Dossier 2025 is finalized and the loan is approved.*
