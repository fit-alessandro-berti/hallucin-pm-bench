No. Counterexamples:

- Case 1001: Update_Inventory occurs before Authorize_Refund (… Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund …).
- Case 1002: There is no Update_Inventory at all; Authorize_Refund is followed by Refund_Issued.
- Case 1003: Update_Inventory occurs before Authorize_Refund, with Quality_Check in between (… Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund …).

Thus, Authorize_Refund does not always occur immediately before Update_Inventory.
