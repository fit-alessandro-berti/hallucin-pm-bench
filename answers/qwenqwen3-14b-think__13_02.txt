3. A low-support activity like **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** can mislead performance or predictive analyses if generalized, as it may be overlooked in process models or statistical patterns. Its rarity could mask critical exceptions (e.g., fraud detection paths) that significantly impact outcomes. Models trained on frequent patterns might fail to account for such cases, leading to biased predictions or incomplete process insights. For example, if manual checks are triggered by rare but high-risk scenarios, their absence in most cases could falsely imply low fraud risk, skewing risk assessments.
