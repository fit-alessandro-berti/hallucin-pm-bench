**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – Confirm applicant’s ID card and mobile phone.  
   → *Proceed only if both are verified; no credit history checks performed.*

2. **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)** – Conducted by an Impact Officer.  
   → *Proceed only if assessment is completed and deemed sufficient.*

3. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – Compare risk scores from:
   - **Senior Underwriter A** (score 0–9)  
   - **Shadow Underwriter B** (score 0–9)  
   → *If scores differ by ≤ 2 points, continue to step 6.*  
   → *If difference exceeds 2 points, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for tie-break decision.*

4. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** – Collect at least **3 local references** using Neighbourhood Feedback Form.  
   → *Proceed only if 3 valid references are received.*

5. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   → *If loan amount < €15 000: system auto-approves.*  
   → *If loan amount ≥ €15 000: proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).*

6. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – Board reviews and votes.  
   → *Only upon approval, proceed to Disburse Funds.*  
   → *If rejected, application terminates.*
