Based **only** on the provided 18 log lines:

1.  **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur?**
    *   The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time** (in Case A1002).

2.  **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**
    *   Total logged events = 18
    *   Occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check" = 1
    *   Percentage = (1 / 18) * 100 = 5.555...%
    *   Rounded to two decimal places: **5.56%**

3.  **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**
    *   The only case identifier containing the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" is **A1002**.

4.  **Two sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable:**
    *   **Small Sample Size:** The fragment contains only 18 events, representing a very small fraction of a month's activity. A single occurrence (like the Manual_Fraud_Check) provides insufficient data to reliably estimate a monthly rate; the true frequency could be significantly higher or lower.
    *   **Limited Time Period:** The fragment covers events occurring within a single day (May 1st, 2025), spanning approximately 5 hours (09:00 to 14:05). It does not capture potential daily variations (e.g., higher/lower fraud check rates on weekends vs weekdays) or weekly/monthly patterns that could significantly impact the monthly frequency estimate. Extrapolating a single day's activity to a full month ignores temporal variability.
