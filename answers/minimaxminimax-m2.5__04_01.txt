**Non‑compliant**

1. **Rule 2** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag`. When this flag is present, `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` appears at position 8, while `Risk_Assessment` appears at position 9 (after `Ship_Goods`), violating the requirement.

2. **Rule 3** – After `Goods_Received` (position 6), `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (i.e., at positions 7 or 8). In the trace, `Three_way_match` occurs at position 10, which is more than two activities away, breaching the distance constraint.
