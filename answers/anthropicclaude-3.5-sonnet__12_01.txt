The fact is INCORRECT.

Justification: Looking at the cases where both "Authorize_Refund" and "Update_Inventory" appear:
- In Case 1001: "Update_Inventory" occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund"
- In Case 1003: "Update_Inventory" occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund"
- In Case 1002: "Update_Inventory" doesn't appear at all

In no case does "Authorize_Refund" occur immediately before "Update_Inventory". The claim is therefore false.
