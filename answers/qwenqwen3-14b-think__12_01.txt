The fact is **not accurate** based on the event-log fragment.  

**Relevant case IDs and activities:**  
- **Case 1001**: "Update_Inventory" occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (Order: `Update_Inventory` → `Authorize_Refund`).  
- **Case 1003**: "Update_Inventory" occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (Order: `Update_Inventory` → `Quality_Check` → `Authorize_Refund`).  

In both cases where both activities are present, "Authorize_Refund" does **not** occur immediately before "Update_Inventory." Instead, "Update_Inventory" precedes "Authorize_Refund." Thus, the claim is contradicted by the data.
