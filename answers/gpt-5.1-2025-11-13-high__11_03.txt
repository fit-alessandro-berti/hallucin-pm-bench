Subject: SLA and Waiting-Time Hotspots in Credit Process  

Based on current performance data, the three weakest activities against their SLAs and waiting times are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval averages 900 seconds throughput versus a 600‑second SLA, exceeding it by 300 seconds, with the highest average waiting time at 600 seconds across 465 cases. Risk Review also exceeds its 300‑second SLA by 300 seconds, with a 600‑second throughput and 480‑second waiting time for 480 cases. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240‑second SLA by 60 seconds, with a 300‑second throughput and 200‑second waiting time for 1,175 cases. Targeted actions are recommended below to address these delays.

• Legal Approval: Reallocate capacity toward this step until average throughput falls from 900 seconds toward the 600‑second SLA.  
• Risk Review: Revise review scope so average throughput drops from 600 seconds toward the 300‑second SLA and waiting time from 480 seconds.  
• Credit Assessment: Standardize assessment steps to lower throughput from 300 seconds toward the 240‑second SLA and waiting time from 200 seconds.
