Our data identifies the three worst-performing activities based jointly on Target SLA breaches and high average waiting times. Legal Approval is the most severe, exceeding its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds while sustaining a 600-second average waiting time. Risk Review also exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, carrying a 480-second waiting time. Finally, Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, holding a 200-second average waiting time across a high volume of 1175 cases. 

To resolve these performance gaps, I recommend the following:
* Eliminate 300 seconds from the 600-second average waiting time in Legal Approval to ensure its 465 cases meet the 600-second SLA.
* Cut the 480-second average waiting time in Risk Review by 300 seconds to instantly align its overall average throughput with the 300-second SLA.
* Reduce the 200-second waiting time in Credit Assessment by a minimum of 60 seconds to directly clear the SLA breach for its 1175 cases.
