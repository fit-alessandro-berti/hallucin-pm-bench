The FACT is **not accurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification:**

The FACT claims that "Authorize\_Refund always occurs immediately *before* Update\_Inventory".

1.  **Case 1001:** The sequence is `Update_Inventory` (08:25:55) $\rightarrow$ `Authorize_Refund` (08:30:02). This contradicts the FACT.
2.  **Case 1002:** The activity `Update_Inventory` is missing. The step before `Authorize_Refund` is `Inspect_Item`.
3.  **Case 1003:** The sequence is `Update_Inventory` (10:08:07) $\rightarrow$ `Quality_Check` (10:15:42) $\rightarrow$ `Authorize_Refund` (10:22:18). This contradicts the FACT, as `Authorize_Refund` occurs *after* `Update_Inventory`, and they are separated by `Quality_Check`.
