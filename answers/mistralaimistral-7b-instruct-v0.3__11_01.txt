 Subject: Urgent: Reducing Waiting Time in Orion Insurance Claims Process

Dear COO,

I am pleased to present an analysis of our claims process's worst-performing activities in terms of waiting time. The following activities require immediate attention:

1. Request_Documents (Average: 36.5 hours, 95th-percentile: 120.0 hours)
   - Recommendation: Implement an automated document management system to streamline the document request process, reducing waiting time by 20% or more.

2. Send_Closure_Letter (Average: 12.2 hours, 95th-percentile: 44.0 hours)
   - Recommendation: Optimize the closure letter generation process by leveraging template-based automation, potentially reducing waiting time by 20% or more.

3. Initial_Screening (Average: 2.1 hours, 95th-percentile: 5.6 hours)
   - Recommendation: Enhance initial screening procedures with advanced automation tools to expedite the process, aiming for a 20% reduction in waiting time.

By addressing these bottlenecks, we can significantly improve our claims processing efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction.

Best regards,
