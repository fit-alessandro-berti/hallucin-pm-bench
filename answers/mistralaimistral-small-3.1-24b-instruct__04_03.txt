**No**, trace 2025-05-RX17 is not compliant with ruleset R.

Justification:

1. **Rule 1**: Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) **and** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur **once each and in that order**. This rule is violated because `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occurs after `Notify_Authorities`.

2. **Rule 2**: If the case-level attribute **severity = "High"**, activity `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen **after both QE and RA**. This rule is not violated in this trace.

3. **Rule 3**: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must **not occur until after** QE **and** RA are complete. This rule is violated because `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.

4. **Rule 4**: `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only **after** NA (and, if required by rule 2, after VP). This rule is not violated in this trace, as `Close_Case` occurs after NA and VP.

The trace is non-compliant due to violations of Rules 1 and 3.
