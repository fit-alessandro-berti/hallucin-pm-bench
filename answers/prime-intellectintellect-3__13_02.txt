1. **"Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time** (in case C05).  

2. **Percentage including "Manual_Fraud_Check":**  
   - **a) Of all events (48):**  
     (1 occurrence / 48 events) × 100 = **2.08%**.  
   - **b) Of all unique cases (12):**  
     (1 case / 12 cases) × 100 = **8.33%**.  

3. **Explanation (≤100 words):**  
   The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" has very low support (1/48 events, 1/12 cases). Generalizing from this slice could mislead analyses by:  
   - Overweighting its importance due to its rarity, ignoring more frequent patterns.  
   - Skewing performance metrics (e.g., average handling time) if outliers dominate.  
   - Leading to incorrect predictive models if the rare event is misinterpreted as a common step.  
   Low-support activities require larger samples to avoid biased conclusions.
