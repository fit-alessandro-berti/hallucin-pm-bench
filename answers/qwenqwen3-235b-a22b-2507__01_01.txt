### Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process

1. **Triage Agent Eligibility Check**  
   - **Decision**: Is the claim eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?  
   - **Basis**: Confirm whether the flight was disrupted (e.g., cancellation, significant delay) due to qualifying circumstances.  
   - **Path Determination**:  
     - If **ineligible** → Claim is declined (implied termination).  
     - If **eligible** → Proceed to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**.

2. **Refund Amount Threshold Check**  
   - **Decision**: Is the refund amount **greater than €1,000**?  
   - **Basis**: Determined during or after *EligibilityChecklist* evaluation.  
   - **Path Determination**:  
     - If **no** (≤ €1,000) → Proceed directly to **Process_Refund_Payment** after pre-approval.  
     - If **yes** (> €1,000) → Trigger **Senior_Auditor_Review** (including *AuditTrail*) before payment processing.

3. **Finance Controller Pre-Approval**  
   - **Decision**: Does the claim meet all criteria on the *EligibilityChecklist*?  
   - **Basis**: Compliance with internal financial and refund policies.  
   - **Path Determination**:  
     - If **not approved** → Claim is declined (implied termination).  
     - If **approved** → Proceed according to value-based path (standard or high-value).

> Note: There is **no** “CustomerService_Agent_Decide” activity in this process — it is explicitly excluded.
