**No**  

**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1**: Violated — `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) as required, but **only if** they are both present and in order. They are both present, so this rule is satisfied.  
- **Rule 2**: Satisfied — Severity is "High", and `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3**: Violated — `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs **before** RA is complete (NA happens before RA in the trace).  
- **Rule 4**: Satisfied — `Close_Case` occurs after NA and after VP (both required for severity="High").  

Since **Rule 3 is violated**, the trace is non-compliant.
