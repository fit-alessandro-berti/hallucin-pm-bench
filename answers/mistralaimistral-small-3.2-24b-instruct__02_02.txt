### Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?

To determine the number of distinct cases, we look at the unique values in the `case` attribute across all events. The cases mentioned are:
- C001
- C002
- C003

Thus, there are **3 distinct cases** in this fragment.

### Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).

We extract the events for case "C002" and list their `concept:name` in chronological order based on the `time:timestamp`:

1. Line 2: Receive_Order
2. Line 5: Check_Stock
3. Line 8: Arrange_Delivery
4. Line 10: Ship_Order

The sequence is:
**Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

### Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

We look at all instances where "Ship_Order" occurs and identify the activity that directly precedes it in the same case. We then list the distinct preceding activities alphabetically.

From the fragment:
1. For case "C001":
   - "Ship_Order" (Line 7) is preceded by "Check_Stock" (Line 3).
2. For case "C002":
   - "Ship_Order" (Line 10) is preceded by "Arrange_Delivery" (Line 8).
3. For case "C003":
   - "Ship_Order" (Line 9) is preceded by "Check_Stock" (Line 6).

The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

Alphabetically ordered:
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
