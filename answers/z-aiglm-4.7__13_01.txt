1. **1**
2. **5.56%** (Calculation: 1 occurrence ÷ 18 total events = 0.0555...)
3. **A1002**
4. **Small sample size**: The dataset contains only 18 events (4 cases), which is statistically insufficient to reliably extrapolate a frequency for an entire month. **Limited time window**: The log captures events from a single day (May 1st); fraud patterns may vary seasonally, weekly, or daily, so a snapshot of one morning is not representative of a month.
