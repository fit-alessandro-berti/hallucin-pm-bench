a) Decision points  
1. Conditional skip of Manual Underwriting Review (step 4): if the Tri-Color-Risk-Check yields Low or Medium risk and the requested amount is ≤ €250 000, then the process bypasses the Manual Underwriting Review; otherwise it proceeds to it.  
2. TriVote Decision Gate (step 6): the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer each vote, and any two approvals suffice for the loan to pass this gate.
