Got it — I’ll rewrite the activities in your process narrative so they adhere strictly to the authorized vocabulary, and then map them to each role in a RACI format.  

Here’s the RACI matrix:

| Activity           | Front-Office Analyst | Compliance Analyst | Compliance Officer | Treasury Ops |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Intake Vetting     | **R**                |                    |                    | **I**        |
| KYC Review         |                      | **R**              | **C**              | **I**        |
| AML Screening      |                      | **R**              | **C**              | **I**        |
| Risk Scoring       |                      | **R**              | **C**              | **I**        |
| Compliance Officer Approval |              | **C**              | **A/R**            | **I**        |
| Schedule Payment   |                      |                    |                    | **A/R**      |
| Release Funds      |                      |                    |                    | **A/R**      |
| Notify Originating Analyst |               |                    |                    | **R**        |

**Legend**:  
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)  
- **A** = Accountable (owns the decision/outcome)  
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)  
- **I** = Informed (kept updated)  

Do you want me to also include a **directional flow diagram** of roles vs. activities based on this RACI?
