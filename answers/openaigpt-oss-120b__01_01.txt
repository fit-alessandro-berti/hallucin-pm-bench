**Decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight‑refund process**

| # | Decision point (activity where a choice is made) | What is decided | Documents consulted/produced at that point |
|---|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** | *Is the claim eligible for a refund?* (Yes / No) | • **FlightManifest**  <br>• **WeatherReport** |
| 2 | **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** | *Does the claim meet the eligibility checklist?* (Approve / Reject) | • **EligibilityChecklist** (filled‑out & signed) |
| 3 | **High‑value branch** (implicit decision after Pre‑Approve) | *Is the refund amount > €1 000?* (High‑value / Standard) | No new document is created here, but the branch triggers the next activity that must include: <br>• **AuditTrail** (required for the Senior_Auditor_Review) |

*Note:* The subsequent activity **Process_Refund_Payment** is gated by the outcomes of the above decisions (Pre‑Approve must be successful, and for high‑value claims the Senior_Auditor_Review must also be completed). It is not itself a decision point.
