**No, the fact is not accurate.**

**Justification:**

The claim states that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately *before* "Update_Inventory," but the data shows the opposite pattern:

- **Case 1001**: Update_Inventory occurs at 08:25:55, followed by Authorize_Refund at 08:30:02
- **Case 1003**: Update_Inventory occurs at 10:08:07, followed by Authorize_Refund at 10:15:42

In both cases where Update_Inventory appears, it occurs *before* Authorize_Refund, not after. Case 1002 does not contain Update_Inventory, so it's not relevant to this sequencing claim.

The fact is factually incorrect based on the temporal ordering in the event log.
