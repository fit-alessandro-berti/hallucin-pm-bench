The requested value cannot be derived from the provided data.

Reason: The event log header shows only case_id, activity, and resource. All timestamps and elapsed-time fields have been redacted, and no durations for “Review Contract” are given. The historical benchmarks do not include “Review Contract,” so they cannot be used to infer its average cycle time. Therefore, an average cycle time for “Review Contract” across the cases cannot be calculated from the information available.
