**Answer 1:** No.

**Answer 2 (bonus):** T3 and T5 both require the single token in P2, produced only once by T1. Since this token can be consumed by at most one of them, they are mutually exclusive: if T5 fires, T3 cannot fire at any time (and vice versa). Therefore, no firing sequence exists where both transitions occur with T5 preceding T3.
