I cannot compute the average cycle time of “Approve Invoice,” its standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval from the provided artefacts because the event log contains only column names and no actual rows or timestamp values. To calculate these exactly, I would need each “Approve Invoice” event’s start_time and complete_time (to derive per-instance durations in hours) and the number of such events (n) to compute variability and the confidence interval. The SLA excerpt provides only high-level targets/historical aggregates, not the underlying event-level measurements required for exact statistics.
