**1. Worst‑Performing Activities**  
- **Review_Documents**  
- **Request_Documents**  
- **Initial_Assessment**  

**2. Why They Under‑perform**  

- *Review_Documents*: 30 min queue, 25 min processing, 9 min variability, 12.4 % SLA breach, 5.3 % rework. High variability and long processing times inflate SLA breaches and rework.  

- *Request_Documents*: 150 min queue, 5 min processing, 1 min variability, 5.5 % SLA breach, **22.0 % rework**. The queue dominates throughput, and the elevated rework reflects frequent incomplete or incorrect submissions.  

- *Initial_Assessment*: 18 min queue, 12 min processing, 4 min variability, 3.2 % SLA breach, 1.8 % rework. While throughput is comparable to peers, the modest wait time combined with higher rework than the others signals an inefficiency in initial data capture.  

**3. Concrete Actions**  

- *Review_Documents*: Deploy automated PDF‑to‑data extraction and real‑time quality checks to cut processing time and reduce variability.  

- *Request_Documents*: Introduce a digital request portal that pre‑validates document completeness and delivers instant acknowledgment, targeting a 50 % reduction in queue time.  

- *Initial_Assessment*: Implement a triage rule set (e.g., rule‑based priority scoring) to reallocate staff to high‑value cases, aiming to lower the 18‑minute queue by 30 %.  

These actions are grounded in the quantitative gaps identified above and will directly improve throughput, SLA compliance, and cost of rework.
