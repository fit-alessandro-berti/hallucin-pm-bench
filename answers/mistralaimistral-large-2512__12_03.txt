**Answer:** No

**Justification:**
The FACT claims that **"Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between**, but this is **not** supported by the event-log excerpt. Here are the relevant CaseIDs and their activity sequences:

1. **CaseID C001**:
   Sequence: `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment` (✅ **matches the FACT**)

2. **CaseID C002**:
   Sequence: `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment` (❌ **violates the FACT** – "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment")

3. **CaseID C003**:
   Sequence: `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment` (✅ **matches the FACT**)

4. **CaseID C004**:
   Sequence: `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment` (❌ **violates the FACT** – "Check_Fraud" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment")

Since **C002 and C004** show intervening activities between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," the FACT is **not accurate**.
