### Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

Based on the outlined process, the key decision points where branching or approval occurs are summarized below, using exact terminology. These are not standard loan steps but specific to the Micro-loan Fast-Track variant.

- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: If the two independent risk scores (from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B) differ by ≤ 2 points, the process continues; otherwise, it escalates to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision before continuing.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: If the requested amount is < €15 000, the system auto-approves and proceeds directly to Disburse Funds; if amount ≥ €15 000, it proceeds to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: The Micro-loan Board votes to approve or reject the application (applicable only for amounts ≥ €15 000); only upon approval does the process proceed to Disburse Funds.

Other steps (e.g., Quick KYC Verification, Community Impact Assessment, Neighbourhood Feedback Check) involve verification, assessment, or data collection but are not explicit decision gates.
