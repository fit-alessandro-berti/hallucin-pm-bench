Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2 Violation (Conditional Precedence):** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4). Therefore, Rule 2 applies, stating that `Risk_Assessment` must occur *before* the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`.
    * `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8.
    * `Risk_Assessment` occurs at event #9.
    * Since `Risk_Assessment` followed `Ship_Goods`, Rule 2 is violated.

2. **Rule 3 Violation (Proximity):** After `Goods_Received` (event #6), activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance $\le 2$).
    * Activity 6: `Goods_Received`
    * Activity 7 (Distance 1): `Move_to_Quality`
    * Activity 8 (Distance 2): `Ship_Goods`
    * Activity 9 (Distance 3): `Risk_Assessment`
    * Activity 10: `Three_way_match` occurred at distance 4 from `Goods_Received` (four activities occurred between them, or it is the 4th activity after it), violating the maximum distance of $\le 2$.

3. **Rule 4 Violation (Role Sequence/Direct Follow):** No activity executed by the role **Intern** may *directly follow* an activity executed by the role **CFO**.
    * Event #3: `Approve_PO_CFO` executed by **CFO**.
    * Event #4: `Expedite_Flag` executed by System.
    * Event #5: `Issue_PO` executed by System.
    * Event #6: `Goods_Received` executed by Warehouse_Clerk.
    * Event #7: `Move_to_Quality` executed by **Intern**.
    * The trace is compliant here because the Intern activity (Event #7) does not directly follow the CFO activity (Event #3).

4. **Rule 1 Compliance (Pre-conditions):** `PO_Amount` > €10 000 (€12 300). Two approvals (`Procurement_Officer` and `CFO`) must occur *before* `Issue_PO` (event #5).
    * Event #2: `Approve_PO` by Procurement_Officer (Done).
    * Event #3: `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO (Done).
    * Both approvals occurred before `Issue_PO`. (Compliant)

5. **Rule 5 Compliance (Termination):** The trace must finish with `Archive_Record` and contain nothing after it.
    * Event #11 is `Archive_Record`, and it is the final event. (Compliant)
