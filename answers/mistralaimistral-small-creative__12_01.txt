No, the fact is **not accurate** with respect to the provided event-log fragment.

### Justification:
1. **Case 1001**:
   - Sequence: `Receive_Return` → `Inspect_Item` → **`Update_Inventory`** → `Authorize_Refund` → `Refund_Issued`.
   - Here, **`Update_Inventory` occurs *before* `Authorize_Refund`**, contradicting the claim.

2. **Case 1002**:
   - Sequence: `Receive_Return` → `Inspect_Item` → **`Authorize_Refund`** → `Refund_Issued`.
   - **`Update_Inventory` is entirely missing** in this case, so the claim cannot hold.

3. **Case 1003**:
   - Sequence: `Receive_Return` → `Inspect_Item` → `Update_Inventory` → `Quality_Check` → **`Authorize_Refund`**.
   - Here, **`Update_Inventory` occurs *before* `Authorize_Refund`**, again contradicting the claim.

### Conclusion:
The claim is **false** in all cases where both activities appear (1001 and 1003). In **Case 1002**, the claim is irrelevant due to the absence of `Update_Inventory`.
