The decision points in Contoso Airlines’ refund process are:

1. **Triage Agent Eligibility Decision** – Determines whether the claim meets eligibility criteria, based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.  
2. **Finance Controller Pre-approval Decision** – Made using the *EligibilityChecklist* to confirm validity before processing.  
3. **Value-Based Routing Decision** – Determines if the refund amount exceeds €1,000. If yes, triggers **Senior_Auditor_Review** and requires the *AuditTrail*; otherwise, proceeds directly toward payment.

Required documents/artefacts in the process:

- *RefundRequestForm*  
- *FlightManifest*  
- *WeatherReport*  
- *EligibilityChecklist*  
- *AuditTrail* (required only for refunds > €1,000)  
- *BankTransferAuthorization*  
- *RefundConfirmationPDF*  

No other documents or decision points are used in this variant of the process.
