Analysis of end-to-end credit workflow identifies three activities jointly failing SLA targets and exhibiting high waiting times, creating significant bottlenecks. Legal Approval shows the most severe breach with an average throughput time of 900s (exceeding its 600s SLA by 300s) and a waiting time of 600s across 465 cases. Risk Review follows, with a throughput time of 600s surpassing its 300s SLA by 300s and a waiting time of 480s over 480 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s throughput (breaching its 240s SLA by 60s) with a waiting time of 249,125 aggregate seconds across all cases, indicating substantial queue pressure despite meeting volume-based per-case thresholds less severely than the others. These three activities cumulatively drive over half the total observed delay while missing their SLAs by material margins. Addressing them is critical to improving customer experience and operational efficiency. Recommendations for immediate action are:  
- Increase Legal Approval capacity or parallel processing to reduce backlog-driven delays exceeding SLA by up to **3x**; current throughput suggests resource constraints under load.  
- Re-engineer Risk Review workflow or add specialist reviewers to cut excess cycle time; each case exceeds target by **1x**, amplified by high internal wait times suggesting process stalls or rework loops.  
- Optimize Credit Assessment scheduling or pre-screening inputs using historical data; reducing per-case variance could lower aggregate wait times that compound system-wide delays despite smaller individual SLA breaches (+6%).
