In case C003, Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order (line 6 then line 7), so it does not follow it; and in case C005, Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order in that case (line 11, no Receive_Order for C005). While it follows in C001 (lines 1–2), C002 (lines 3–5), and C004 (lines 8–9), the statement “always follows” is false due to C003 and C005.
