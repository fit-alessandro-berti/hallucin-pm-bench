Add a **48-hour timer** at the **Start_Claim** event. When it expires, redirect the flow to a compensating event that bypasses subsequent tasks and connects directly to the **End_Done** event. This ensures claims not reaching **Triage** within 48 hours are auto-escalated by terminating early. Use existing nodes/events to rewire the path without adding tasks.
