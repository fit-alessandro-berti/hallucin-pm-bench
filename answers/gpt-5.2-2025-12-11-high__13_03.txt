1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ This excerpt contains only **3 cases** and all events occur on **2025‑03‑01**, so it may not be representative of the full month’s volume or mix of applications. Estimating frequency from this small slice can therefore over- or understate how often manual fraud checks happen across March. Also, even within this snippet, fraud-check-related activities appear under **different labels** (e.g., **“Automatic Fraud Check”** vs **“Fraud Check (Automatic)”**). If the full log contains additional naming variants for manual checks, counting only the exact string **“Manual Fraud Check”** would miscount them.
