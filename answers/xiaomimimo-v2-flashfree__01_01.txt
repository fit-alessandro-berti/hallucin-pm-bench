### Decision Points in Contoso’s Process

Based on the provided process description, there is a single explicit decision point:

- **High-Value Refund Check** (following Finance_Controller_PreApprove):
  - This decision determines if the refund amount is **greater than €1,000**.
  - If **yes**: The case must proceed to Senior_Auditor_Review before Process_Refund_Payment can occur.
  - If **no**: Process_Refund_Payment can proceed directly after Finance_Controller_PreApprove, without the need for Senior_Auditor_Review.

### Required Documents

The following documents are explicitly defined as required for the process:

- **RefundRequestForm** (submitted by the customer during Customer_Submit_Claim).
- **FlightManifest** (referenced by Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility).
- **WeatherReport** (referenced by Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility).
- **EligibilityChecklist** (used by Finance_Controller_PreApprove).
- **AuditTrail** (required for Senior_Auditor_Review in high-value cases only).
- **BankTransferAuthorization** (must be present before Process_Refund_Payment can begin).
- **RefundConfirmationPDF** (emailed to the passenger during Issue_Confirmation_Letter).

No additional activities or artefacts beyond those listed have been introduced.
