1️⃣ The activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **one** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst observing only this excerpt might overestimate the prevalence of manual fraud checks. This snippet represents a very small sample of the full month-long log. The activities present are not necessarily representative of the entire dataset. For example, Case ID 1002 underwent a manual fraud check, while Case IDs 1001 and 1003 did not. Without broader data, it's impossible to determine if this is an anomaly or a typical pattern across all loan applications in March 2025.
