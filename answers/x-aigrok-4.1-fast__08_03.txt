**Yes.**

Shortest firing sequence: **T1, T2b, T4, T5**

### Explanation:
- **T1**: `p0` → `pa=1, pb=1`
- **T2b**: `pa=1` → `pd=1`  (shortcut, skips `pc`)
- **T4**: `pb=1` → `pe=1`
- **T5**: `pd=1, pe=1` → `pf=1`

At this point, **T5** has fired, but **T3** has not (and cannot, since `pc=0`). This is reachable from the initial marking.
