RE: Critical Process Performance Issues Requiring Immediate Action

Analysis of our credit processing workflow reveals three activities with significant performance gaps. Legal Approval shows the most severe SLA breach, exceeding its 600-second target by 900 seconds while averaging 600 seconds of waiting time. Risk Review breaches its 300-second SLA by 780 seconds with 480 seconds average waiting time. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 260 seconds while accumulating 200 seconds waiting time.

These bottlenecks directly impact customer experience and operational efficiency. Immediate intervention is required to address these throughput and waiting time gaps.

• Legal Approval: Implement parallel review streams for standard-risk applications to reduce sequential processing delays
• Risk Review: Deploy additional specialized staff during peak hours to handle the 480-second waiting backlog
• Credit Assessment: Optimize automated scoring algorithms to reduce manual intervention requirements
