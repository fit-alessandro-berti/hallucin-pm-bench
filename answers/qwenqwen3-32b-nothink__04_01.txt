**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1 violation**: The PO amount is €12,300, which exceeds the €10,000 threshold. According to Rule 1, the PO must receive **two approvals**—first by a *Procurement Officer* and then by the *CFO*—**before** the `Issue_PO` activity. While the trace includes both `Approve_PO` (Procurement Officer) and `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO), these approvals occur **before** `Issue_PO` (activities 2 and 3 precede activity 5), so this rule is **compliant**.

2. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace includes the `Expedite_Flag` activity (activity 4). According to Rule 2, this makes `Quality_Check` optional, but `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at activity 8, and `Risk_Assessment` occurs at activity 9, **after** `Ship_Goods`. This violates Rule 2.

3. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (activity 6), the activity `Three_way_match` must occur **within the next two activities** (i.e., at most two steps after). `Three_way_match` occurs at activity 10, which is **four activities** after `Goods_Received` (activity 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10). This violates Rule 3.

4. **Rule 4 violation**: Activity 7 (`Move_to_Quality`) is executed by the **Intern** role and directly follows activity 6 (`Goods_Received`), which is executed by the **Warehouse_Clerk**. There is **no activity by the CFO directly before an Intern activity** in this trace, so **Rule 4 is not violated**.

5. **Rule 5 violation**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (activity 11), and there are no activities after it. This is **compliant** with Rule 5.

**Final Answer: Non-compliant**  
**Reasons: Violations of Rule 2 and Rule 3.**
