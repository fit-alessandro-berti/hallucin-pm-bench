**Decision Points:**  
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: Determines whether the refund claim is eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.  
2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: Approves eligibility using the *EligibilityChecklist*.  
3. **High-value check (implicit decision)**: If the refund amount > €1,000, triggers **Senior_Auditor_Review**.  
4. **Senior_Auditor_Review** (conditional): Conducts audit only for high-value claims; requires the *AuditTrail*. This is a gate before proceeding to payment for such cases.  
5. **Gate to Process_Refund_Payment**: Payment proceeds only if:  
   - Finance_Controller_PreApprove succeeded, AND  
   - For claims > €1,000: Senior_Auditor_Review completed successfully. Additionally, requires signed *BankTransferAuthorization*.
