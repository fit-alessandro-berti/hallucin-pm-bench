Below is a summary of the **decision points** in Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process, based on the defined flow. I have used exactly the activity names as specified in the process description. Following that, I have listed every required document as stated.

### Summary of Decision Points:
The decision points in the process are points where the flow branches based on specific conditions. These are:

- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: If the two risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤ 2 points, the process continues to the next step. Otherwise, it escalates to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision before continuing.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: If the loan amount is < €15 000, the system auto-approves. If the loan amount is ≥ €15 000, the process proceeds to the next step.
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: The board votes to approve or reject the application.

### List of Every Required Document:
The required documents at submission time, as specified, are:
- Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
- Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
