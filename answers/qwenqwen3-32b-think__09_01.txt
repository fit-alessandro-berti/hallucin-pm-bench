The requested value **cannot be derived** from the provided data.  

The event log does not include timestamps or elapsed-time fields for the activities, which are required to calculate the duration of the **"Review Contract"** activity. Without explicit temporal data (e.g., start/end times or time deltas), it is impossible to compute the average cycle time for this activity across the cases listed. The historical benchmarks also do not include "Review Contract," so they cannot be used to infer the value.  

**Answer:**  
1) **Cannot be determined** with the provided data.  
2) **Explanation:** The log lacks timestamp or elapsed-time fields necessary to calculate activity durations. No historical benchmark for "Review Contract" is available either.
