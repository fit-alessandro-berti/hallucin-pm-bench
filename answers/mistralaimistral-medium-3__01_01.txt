### **Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process**
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**
   - **Decision**: Is the claim eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?
   - **Outcome**: Proceeds to *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* if valid; otherwise, the claim is rejected.

2. **High-value branch (after Finance_Controller_PreApprove)**
   - **Decision**: Is the refund amount **>€1,000**?
   - **Outcome**:
     - If **yes**, route to *Senior_Auditor_Review* (requires *AuditTrail*).
     - If **no**, proceed directly to *Process_Refund_Payment*.

3. **Process_Refund_Payment**
   - **Decision**: Are all prerequisites met?
     - *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* completed **and** (if high-value) *Senior_Auditor_Review* completed.
   - **Outcome**: Payment is executed if requirements are satisfied.
