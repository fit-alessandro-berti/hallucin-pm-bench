### **Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)**  
   – Confirm applicant's ID card **and** mobile phone.  
   – *No credit history checks are performed.*

2. **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)**  
   – Conducted by an **Impact Officer** to evaluate the social or economic benefit of the loan within the community.

3. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   – Compare risk scores from:  
     • **Senior Underwriter A**  
     • **Shadow Underwriter B**  
   – If scores differ by **≤ 2 points**: proceed to next step.  
   – If scores differ by **> 2 points**: escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a binding decision.

4. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   – If loan **amount < €15 000**: system triggers **auto-approval**.  
   – If loan **amount ≥ €15 000**: proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.

5. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**  
   – The **Micro-loan Board** reviews and votes to either *approve* or *reject* the application.
