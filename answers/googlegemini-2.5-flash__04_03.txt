No.

**Justification:**

*   **Rule 1 (QE and RA order):** Satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
*   **Rule 2 (Severity "High" and VP):** Satisfied. Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` is required and occurs after both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
*   **Rule 3 (NA timing):** Violated. `Notify_Authorities` occurs after `Quality_Engineer_Review` but *before* `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete. The rule states that `Notify_Authorities` must not occur until *after* both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` are complete.
*   **Rule 4 (CC timing):** Satisfied. `Close_Case` occurs after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
