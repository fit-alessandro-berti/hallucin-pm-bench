1. Exactly how many times does the activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occur in this fragment?  
   **Answer:** 1  
   *Rationale: Only one log line contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" (case A1002, 2025-05-01T10:50:00).*

2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)  
   **Answer:** 5.56%  
   *Rationale: Total events = 18. (1 / 18) × 100 = 5.555...% → rounded to two decimal places = 5.56%.*

3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.  
   **Answer:** A1002  
   *Rationale: "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears only in case A1002. No other cases contain this activity.*

4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.  
   **Answer:**  
   (i) **Insufficient temporal coverage**: The fragment covers only one day (May 1, 2025), which is not representative of a full month. Fraud checks may vary by day of week, time of month, or external factors (e.g., holidays).  
   (ii) **Extremely small sample size for the event**: Manual fraud checks occurred only once in the sample (1 out of 18 events). This is statistically inadequate for estimating a rare event's monthly frequency.  
   *Note: Answers strictly based on the provided log; no external assumptions.*
