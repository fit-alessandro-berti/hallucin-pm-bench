- 2b) Share of unique cases: 8.33% (1/12)

- 3) Manual_Fraud_Check appears only once in this slice: 1 of 48 events and 1 of 12 cases. Such low support makes its performance statistics highly unstable; one timestamp drives all averages. Predictive models trained here will rarely see the manual path and underfit it, yielding poor predictions when it occurs. Aggregated KPIs (e.g., cycle time) will be dominated by the automated path, potentially masking delays or behaviors specific to the manual check.
