Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 requires that if `Expedite_Flag` occurs, `Risk_Assessment` must happen **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` is at event #8, but `Risk_Assessment` only appears at event #9, i.e., after `Ship_Goods`. This violates Rule 2.

2. Additionally, Rule 4 states that no activity executed by an **Intern** may directly follow an activity executed by the **CFO**. Here, event #7 is `Move_to_Quality` by Intern, directly following event #6 `Goods_Received` by Warehouse_Clerk, so no violation here. However, the CFO's last activity was at event #3, so no direct CFOâ†’Intern adjacency occurs. Thus, Rule 4 is respected.

3. Rule 1 is respected: two approvals by Procurement Officer (#2) and CFO (#3) occur before `Issue_PO` (#5).

4. Rule 3 states `Three-way_match` must occur within two activities after `Goods_Received` (#6). `Three-way_match` is at event #10, which is four steps after `Goods_Received` (#7, #8, #9, #10). This violates Rule 3.

5. Rule 5 requires the trace to end with `Archive_Record` with nothing after it, which is respected.

Summary: The trace violates Rule 2 (wrong order of Risk_Assessment vs Ship_Goods) and Rule 3 (Three-way_match too late), so it is **Non-compliant**.
