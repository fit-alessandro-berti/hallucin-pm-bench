**Non-compliant**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1 (Met):** The PO amount (€12 300) exceeds the €10 000 threshold. The trace correctly logs approvals first by the Procurement Officer (Step 2) and then by the CFO (Step 3) **before** the `Issue_PO` activity (Step 5). 
2. **Rule 2 (Violated):** The trace contains the `Expedite_Flag` (Step 4), which triggers the condition that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, in this trace, `Risk_Assessment` (Step 9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` (Step 8).
3. **Rule 3 (Violated):** After `Goods_Received` (Step 6), `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). In the trace, `Three_way_match` takes place at Step 10, which is a distance of 4 activities away from Step 6.
4. **Rule 4 (Met):** The CFO activity (Step 3) is directly followed by a System activity (Step 4). The only activity executed by an Intern (Step 7) directly follows a Warehouse_Clerk activity (Step 6), meaning an Intern does not directly follow a CFO. 
5. **Rule 5 (Met):** The trace finishes legitimately with `Archive_Record` (Step 11), with no further events logged afterward. 

**Conclusion:** The trace is Non-compliant due to direct violations of **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**.
