   a) Total number of events in the log: 48 (12 cases × 4 activities).
        - "Manual_Fraud_Check" = 1  => Percentage = (1/48)×100 ≈ 2.08%
   b) Number of unique cases: 12

3. The "Manual_Fraud_Check" activity occurs only once across all 12 cases and 48 events, representing a tiny fraction of overall activity. Generalizing its inclusion into performance or predictive models could incorrectly imply that fraud verification is a common, expected step in all claims, when in reality it is an outlier requiring manual review in rare cases. This could bias algorithms to overestimate fraud resolution times and accuracy while distorting insights into typical workflows.
