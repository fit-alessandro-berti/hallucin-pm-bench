### **1) Average Cycle Time of “Review Contract” — Cannot Be Determined**

**Answer:**  
The average cycle time for the activity **“Review Contract”** **cannot be derived** from the provided data.

### **2) Explanation of Calculation**

The provided log contains **only the case IDs, activity names, and resources** responsible for each activity. It **does not include any timestamp or duration information** for the activities — specifically, there are **no start or end times** for any of the activities, including “Review Contract”.

To compute the **cycle time** (or duration) of an activity, we would need at least one of the following:
- **Start and end timestamps** for each occurrence of the activity, **or**
- **Elapsed time values** (e.g., duration in hours) explicitly recorded for each activity instance.

Since **neither timestamps nor elapsed times are present** in the log, it is **impossible** to calculate the duration of any activity — including “Review Contract” — and therefore **the average cycle time cannot be determined** from the data given.

Additionally, while historical benchmark data is provided for other activities (e.g., “Receive Renewal Request”, “Negotiate Terms”, and “Legal Sign-off”), these **do not apply** to “Review Contract”, and there is **no benchmark provided for “Review Contract”** anyway.

### ✅ **Conclusion**
- **Required data missing**: Timestamps or durations.
- **Result**: **Insufficient information to compute the average cycle time** for “Review Contract”.
