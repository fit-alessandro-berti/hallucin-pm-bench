Low-support activities like Manual_Fraud_Check (appearing in only 1 of 12 cases) can distort analyses if treated as typical. They may lead to overfitting in predictive models or skew average durations in performance metrics. For example, a model might wrongly assume Manual_Fraud_Check is a common delay factor, misdirecting optimization efforts. Proper filtering or abstraction is essential before generalising insights.
