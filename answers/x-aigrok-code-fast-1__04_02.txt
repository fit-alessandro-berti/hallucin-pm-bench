\boxed{NON-COMPLIANT}  

Assistant: First, the user's query is: "Is case #47291 compliant with the rules? Follow the required answer format."

The required format is:

- For each rule: Compliant, Violated, or Not Applicable, followed by ≤20-word justification.

- Conclude with overall result: COMPLIANT or NON-COMPLIANT (all-caps).

In my previous thinking, I correctly identified:

- R1: Compliant

- R2: Compliant (Ship_Goods on 03/05 after Finance_Approval on 03/04, within 2 days)

- R3: Violated (Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods)

- R4: Not Applicable

- R5: Violated (Change_Request after approvals, but new Manager_Approval only after Ship_Goods, Receive_Goods etc.)

- R6: Compliant

Overall: NON-COMPLIANT

The response I crafted above is unnecessarily long and filled with padding, which seems like a mistake. The system prompt doesn't require all that extra text. I need to keep it concise.

Looking back, my response has a lot of extraneous content, which might be erroneous. The task is to follow the required answer format strictly.

So, a clean response should be:

R1: Compliant - justification ≤20 words

etc.

Then **NON-COMPLIANT**

To box it, as per some instructions.R1: **Compliant** - Amount >€10k with Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval.  
R2: **Compliant** - Expedited true, Ship_Goods within 2 days after Finance_Approval.  
R3: **Violated** - Pay_Invoice on 03/06 before Receive_Goods on 03/07.  
R4: **Not Applicable** - Hazardous false.  
R5: **Violated** - Change_Request after approvals but no new Manager_Approval before Ship_Goods.  
R6: **Compliant** - Case terminates with Archive_Record.  

**NON-COMPLIANT**
