No. The fact is not accurate. In the given log fragment, for case C003 (lines 6-7), the activity *Validate_Payment* occurs at 2025-02-01T10:43:00Z **before** the *Receive_Order* activity at 2025-02-01T10:45:00Z (reversed order). This contradicts the claim that *Validate_Payment* "always follows" *Receive_Order*.
