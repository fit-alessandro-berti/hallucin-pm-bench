# Contoso Airlines Flight-Refund Process — Decision Points & Required Documents

---

## Decision Points

The process contains **three** decision points:

### 1. Eligibility Decision (at **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**)
- **Question asked:** Does the claim satisfy eligibility rules based on the *FlightManifest* and the *WeatherReport*?
- **Outcome:** The claim either passes validation and advances to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**, or it does not.

### 2. Pre-Approval Decision (at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**)
- **Question asked:** Does the finance controller sign off on the claim per the *EligibilityChecklist*?
- **Outcome:** The claim is either pre-approved (allowing it to continue toward payment) or it is not.

### 3. High-Value Threshold Decision (after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**)
- **Question asked:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1 000**?
- **Outcomes:**
  - **Yes → Senior_Auditor_Review** must be completed (including the *AuditTrail*) before payment can proceed.
  - **No →** The process moves directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.
