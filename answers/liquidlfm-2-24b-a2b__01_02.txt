**Decision Points in Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – Confirm ID and mobile; skip credit history checks.  
2. **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)** – Conducted by Impact Officer.  
3. **Dual Underwriter Split** – Senior Underwriter A assigns risk score; Shadow Underwriter B independently assigns risk score.  
4. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – Compare scores:  
   - If difference ≤ 2 → continue to step 6.  
   - If difference > 2 → escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break, then continue.  
5. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** – Collect at least 3 local references.  
6. **Amount Threshold Decision** –  
   - If amount < €15 000 → auto-approve.  
   - If amount ≥ €15 000 → proceed to step 8.  
7. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – Board votes approve or reject.  
8. **Disburse Funds** – Release loan amount.
