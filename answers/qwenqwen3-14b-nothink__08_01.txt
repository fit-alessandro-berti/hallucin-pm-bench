**Answer: No**, it is **not possible** for transition **T5** to fire **before** transition **T3** in any reachable marking of this Petri net.

---

### **Reasoning and Justification:**

Let’s analyze the net structure and the conditions under which **T5** can fire.

- Transition **T5** has:
  - A **normal input arc** from **p3** (so it needs at least 1 token in p3).
  - An **inhibitor arc** from **p4** (so T5 is **only enabled** if p4 contains **zero** tokens).

- Transition **T3** is the only way **p4** gets tokens. It consumes 1 token from p2 and produces 1 token in p4.

- Note that the initial marking is:
  - **p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)**

To enable **T5**, we must have:
- At least one token in **p3**
- **Zero tokens** in **p4**

Additionally, **p3** can only get tokens via **T2**, which is fed from **p1**, which is fed from **T1** (which is fed from **p0**).

Let’s examine the firing order:

### Attempting a Firing Sequence That Fires T5 Before T3

Start from **initial marking**:

- p0=1, others = 0

#### Step 1:
- T1 is enabled (p0 has 1 token), so **T1 fires**:
  - p0 becomes 0
  - p1 and p2 each get 1 token.
  - Resulting marking:
    - p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, others = 0

#### Step 2:
- Both **T2** and **T3** are now enabled.
- Let’s **attempt to fire T5** next. But:
  - p3 = 0 (it has not been fired)
  - p4 = 0 (no tokens yet)
  - So, **T5 is not enabled**

- Therefore, T5 still cannot fire.

#### Step 3:
- Fire **T2**: consumes p1 (now 0), produces p3.
  - p3 = 1
  - Resulting marking:
    - p1=0, p3=1, p2=1, others = 0

- Now, can **T5** fire?
  - p3 = 1 (OK)
  - p4 = 0 (OK)
  - → **T5 is enabled**, so we could fire it **now**.

But wait — **T3** has not yet fired. **T3** is also enabled (p2 = 1), and firing **T3** would give p4 = 1, which would **inhibit** T5.

So, is there a **firing sequence** where **T5 fires before T3**?

### Let's try to **fire T5 before T3**:

- From the state:
  - p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0

- Is **T3** fired yet? No.
- Can we fire **T5** now (yes), but once we fire T5, we **lose the chance** to fire T3 without inhibiting it.

So, assume **T5 fires** here:
- p3 = 0 (consumed)
- p6 = 1

- Resulting marking:
  - p1=0, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p6=1

Then, we try to fire **T3**: it is enabled (p2=1). Firing **T3** would produce p4=1, which would **inhibit** T5 if it had been enabled again.

So, the key point is: **T5 can only fire after p3 is filled (via T2), and before p4 is filled (via T3)**.

That is: **T5 must occur between T2 and T3**.

Therefore, **T5 cannot fire before T3**.

If T3 has **not yet fired**, but T5 can fire, then **T5 fires in between T2 and T3**, but **not before T3**.

Hence, **T5 cannot fire before T3** in any reachable marking.

### ✅ **Final Answer: No**

It is **not possible** for **T5** to fire **before T3** in any reachable marking of this Petri net. This would require **p3 to be non-empty** (which only occurs after T2), and **p4 to be empty** (which is true only before T3 fires). Thus, **T5 can only fire after T2 and before T3**, but **not before T3**.
