It is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice." Calculation requires specific timestamp values (start_time and complete_time) for actual process instances, but Artefact A provides only column headers with every data row redacted. Additionally, Artefact B offers only historical transition data between activities, not the internal duration of the activity itself within the current log.
