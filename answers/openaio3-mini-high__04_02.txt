R1: Compliant – Manager_Approval (03/03 11:05) was followed by Finance_Approval (03/04 08:17) for the high‐value order.  
R2: Violated – Change_Request reset the approval chain, yet Ship_Goods occurred before a new Manager_Approval within two days.  
R3: Violated – Pay_Invoice (03/06) occurred before Receive_Goods (03/07), breaching the required sequence.  
R4: Not Applicable – The order is non‐hazardous; Safety_Inspection is not required.  
R5: Violated – A Change_Request after approval mandates a new Manager_Approval, which happened only after Ship_Goods.  
R6: Compliant – The case terminated with an Archive_Record as required.  

Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT
