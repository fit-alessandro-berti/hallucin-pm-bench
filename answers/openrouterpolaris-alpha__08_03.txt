Short answer: Yes, it is possible.

Reasoning:
- T5 needs one token in pd and one in pe.
- pd can be produced either:
  - via the “normal” path pa → T2 → pc → T3 → pd, or
  - via the shortcut T2b: pa → T2b → pd (which does NOT use T3).
- pe is produced from pb via T4.
- Because pa and pb are created in parallel by T1, we can choose the shortcut T2b and thus enable T5 without ever firing T3.

A shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3:
- T1, T2b, T4, T5

Check:
- After T1: pa=1, pb=1
- After T2b: pd=1, pb=1
- After T4: pd=1, pe=1
- T5 is now enabled (pd=1, pe=1), so T5 fires and consumes pd,pe → produces pf.
- T3 has not fired before T5.
