1️⃣ The activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs exactly **twice** in the provided excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst who sees only this snippet might still misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks in the full month-long log because the excerpt only includes a small subset of the total events. The snippet does not provide information on the total number of applications processed or the proportion of applications that undergo manual fraud checks. Therefore, the analyst might incorrectly assume that manual fraud checks are more or less common than they actually are based solely on this limited data.
