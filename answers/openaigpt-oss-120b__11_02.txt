Our dashboard pinpoints three activities that are jeopardising throughput and SLA compliance.

1. **Request Documents** – avg wait ≈ 150 min, rework ≈ 22 % and SLA breach 5.5 %. The queue is the longest in the chain; cases sit idle for 2½ hours before the activity even starts, and a fifth of them must be repeated, inflating cycle time and breach risk.  
   *Action*: Implement a “document‑auto‑request” portal with real‑time status nudges to claimants, targeting a ≤ 30 min reduction in wait time (≈ 80 % cut) and halving rework.

2. **Review Documents** – avg processing ≈ 25 min, stdev 9 min, SLA breach 12.4 % and rework 5.3 %. Processing is both slow and highly variable, driving the highest breach rate across the process.  
   *Action*: Introduce a standardized document‑checklist and OCR‑assisted triage to curb manual inspection, aiming to cut average processing to ≤ 15 min and reduce variability below 4 min.

3. **Initial Assessment** – avg wait 18 min, processing 12 min, SLA breach 3.2 % and rework 1.8 %. Although earlier steps are faster, this hand‑off introduces a noticeable delay and breach spike.  
   *Action*: Deploy a decision‑support rule set that auto‑populates assessment fields from the claim registration data, shortening wait by ≥ 10 min and lowering rework below 1 %.

Collectively, these focused, data‑driven interventions can shrink total end‑to‑end time by > 30 % and bring SLA breaches back within target.
