Analysis identifies the three worst-performing activities by waiting time:

**#1 Request_Documents** (Avg: 36.5h, 95p: 120.0h)  
**Action:** Automate requests via a customer self-service portal to eliminate manual batching delays.

**#2 Send_Closure_Letter** (Avg: 12.2h, 95p: 44.0h)  
**Action:** Trigger automated digital notifications immediately upon claim resolution to remove manual handoffs.

**#3 Assess_Liability** (Avg: 7.8h, 95p: 16.4h)
