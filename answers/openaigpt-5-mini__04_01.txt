Non-compliant

1. Violation of Rule 2: Trace contains Expedite_Flag (#4), so Risk_Assessment must occur before the first Ship_Goods. Here Ship_Goods occurs at #8 while Risk_Assessment occurs after it at #9 → violates Rule 2.

2. Violation of Rule 3: After Goods_Received (#6) Three_way_match must occur within the next two activities (positions +1 or +2: #7 or #8). Three_way_match occurs at #10 (too late) → violates Rule 3.

3. Rule 1 is satisfied: for PO_Amount €12,300 the trace shows Approve_PO by Procurement_Officer (#2) then Approve_PO_CFO by CFO (#3) before Issue_PO (#5).

4. Rule 4 is satisfied: no Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity (CFO at #3 is followed by System at #4).

5. Rule 5 is satisfied: the trace ends with Archive_Record (#11) and contains nothing after it.
