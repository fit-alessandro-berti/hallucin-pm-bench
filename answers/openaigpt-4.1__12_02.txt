No.

The stated fact is not accurate. In case C003 (lines 6 and 7), *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 6 before *Receive_Order* at line 7, which means *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order*. Additionally, in cases C005 (lines 11 and 12) and C002 (lines 3, 4, and 5), *Validate_Payment* also does not strictly follow *Receive_Order*; in C005 there is no *Receive_Order* event at all before *Validate_Payment*. Therefore, the statement is contradicted by the evidence in the log fragment.
