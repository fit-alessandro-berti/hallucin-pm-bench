### Answer:
**No**

### Justification:
The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between. However, based on the event-log excerpt, this is not true for all cases. Specifically:

- **Case C002**: The activity sequence is `Receive_Order` (at 2025-01-03T09:30:00) → `Pack_Items` (at 2025-01-03T09:50:00) → `Validate_Payment` (at 2025-01-03T10:05:00). Here, `Validate_Payment` does not occur immediately after `Receive_Order`; `Pack_Items` is an intervening activity.
  
- **Case C004**: The activity sequence is `Receive_Order` (at 2025-01-03T10:05:00) → `Check_Fraud` (at 2025-01-03T10:07:00) → `Validate_Payment` (at 2025-01-03T10:20:00). Here, `Validate_Payment` does not occur immediately after `Receive_Order`; `Check_Fraud` is an intervening activity.

In contrast, Cases C001 and C003 do show `Validate_Payment` occurring immediately after `Receive_Order` with no activities in between:
- **Case C001**: Sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` → `Pack_Items`.
- **Case C003**: Sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` → `Ship_Order`.

However, since the FACT uses the word "always," it must hold true for all instances in the log. The presence of Cases C002 and C004, where other activities occur between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, directly contradicts the FACT. Therefore, the FACT is inaccurate.
