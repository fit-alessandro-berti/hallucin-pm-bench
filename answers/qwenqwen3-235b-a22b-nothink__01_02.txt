**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**  
1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** (Step 5): Branches based on the difference between the two underwriter risk scores (*≤ 2 points* results in continuation; [> 2 points] results in escalation to the Harmonisation Committee).  
2. **Amount Threshold Decision** (Step 7): Branches based on the requested loan amount (["< €15 000"] triggers auto-approval; ["≥ €15 000"] requires escalation to the Micro-loan Board).  
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval** (Step 8): Decides a binary *"approve"* or *"reject"* outcome for applications with amounts ≥ €15 000.
