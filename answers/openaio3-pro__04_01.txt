Non-compliant  

1. Rule 2: Expedite_Flag is present, so Risk_Assessment must appear before the first Ship_Goods. In the trace Ship_Goods is at step 8 and Risk_Assessment at step 9 ⇒ order is wrong ⇒ rule violated.  
2. Rule 3: Three_way_match must occur within two activities after Goods_Received. Goods_Received is step 6; the next two activities are steps 7 and 8, while Three_way_match occurs only at step 10 (distance 4) ⇒ rule violated.  

Rules 1, 4 and 5 are satisfied, but any single violation makes the case non-compliant.
