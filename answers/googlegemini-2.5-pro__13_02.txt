Based on the data supplied:

1.  The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time.

2.  
    a) Percentage of all events: **2.08%** (1 of 48 total events).  
    b) Percentage of all unique cases: **8.33%** (1 of 12 total cases).

3.  Generalising from a low-support activity like "Manual_Fraud_Check" (present in only one case) is risky. Performance analysis, such as calculating average case duration, would be skewed by this single instance, which may be an outlier. For predictive models, one positive example is insufficient to learn the conditions that trigger this path. The model cannot identify reliable patterns, leading to poor predictive accuracy for this rare but potentially critical process variant. Extrapolating from this single occurrence could lead to flawed conclusions about the overall process.
