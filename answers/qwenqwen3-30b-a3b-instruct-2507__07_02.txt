• **Added tasks**  
  - `Task_VerifyIdentity` (Verify Identity)  
  - `Task_RequestDocs` (Request Additional Documents)  
  - `Task_FinalReject` (Final Reject)  
  - `Task_ApproveLoan` (Auto-Approve Loan) — Note: This is a *new task with a different name*, distinct from the original `Task_ApproveLoan`, so counted as added due to semantic change in function (automated vs. manual approval).

• **Removed tasks**  
  - `Task_RejectLoan` (Reject Loan) — replaced by `Task_FinalReject`

• **Gateway-type changes**  
  - `exclusiveGateway` (id="Gateway_Decision") → `inclusiveGateway` (id="Gateway_Decision")  
  - The gateway type has changed from **Exclusive** to **Inclusive**, altering branching behavior to allow multiple outgoing flows to be taken simultaneously.
