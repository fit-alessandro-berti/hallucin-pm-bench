## Answers Based on the Data Provided:

1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1 time** in this excerpt (in case 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks from this snippet because:
- The sample size is extremely small (only 3 cases)
- The time window is narrow (less than 2 hours of a month-long log)
- There appear to be naming inconsistencies in fraud check activities ("Automatic Fraud Check" vs "Fraud Check (Automatic)")
- Different case routing exists (some cases undergo automatic checks, others manual)
- We can't see the selection criteria that determine which path a case follows
- The excerpt may not be representative of the overall process distribution
