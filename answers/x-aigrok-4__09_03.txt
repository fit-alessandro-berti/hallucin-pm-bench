1. I cannot compute the average cycle time.

2. I cannot provide the standard deviation or a 95% confidence interval.

3. The event log in Artefact A is fully redacted with no actual rows, timestamps, or data values provided, making it impossible to identify instances of the "Approve Invoice" activity or calculate their durations (as complete_time minus start_time) for averaging or statistical analysis; Artefact B provides unrelated metrics on inter-activity times and SLAs, not the intra-activity cycle times needed here.
