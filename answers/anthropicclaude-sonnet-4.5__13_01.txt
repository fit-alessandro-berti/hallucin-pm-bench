## 1. Exactly how many times does the activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occur in this fragment?

**1 time**

(It appears once in case A1002 at 2025-05-01T10:50:00)

## 2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)

**5.56%**

(1 occurrence out of 18 total log lines: 1/18 = 0.0556 = 5.56%)

## 3. List the case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check".

**A1002**

(This is the only case containing the Manual_Fraud_Check activity)

## 4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.

1. **Insufficient sample size**: The fragment contains only 4 cases over a 5-hour period (09:00-14:05 on a single day). Extrapolating from 4 cases to estimate monthly frequency (which could involve hundreds or thousands of cases) introduces extreme uncertainty and fails to capture the true population variance.

2. **Temporal bias / Non-representative time window**: The fragment captures only one specific 5-hour window on May 1st, 2025. Fraud patterns, order volumes, and fraud-check triggers may vary significantly by time of day, day of week, seasonality, promotions, or other temporal factors not represented in this narrow snapshot. The sample may not reflect typical monthly patterns.
