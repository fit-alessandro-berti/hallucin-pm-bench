Non-compliant

Justification:
1.  Rule 2 is violated because the trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), which requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur before the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` (event #8) occurs before `Risk_Assessment` (event #9).
2.  Rule 3 is violated because `Three_way_match` must occur within the next two activities after `Goods_Received`. In the trace, `Goods_Received` is event #6, while `Three_way_match` is event #10, which is four activities later.
