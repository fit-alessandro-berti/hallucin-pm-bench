The requested value cannot be derived.

Explanation: The event log provided contains only the sequence of activities, case IDs, and resource assignments — but no timestamp or elapsed-time data for any activity (including “Review Contract”). Without duration measurements or start/end times, it is impossible to compute an average cycle time for any activity. The historical benchmarks from FY-2023 are irrelevant to this log’s data and cannot substitute for missing timing information.
