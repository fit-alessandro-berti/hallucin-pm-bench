**1️⃣** The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs once in the provided excerpt.  

**2️⃣** An analyst viewing only this snapshot may overestimate the prevalence of manual fraud checks due to limited data. The sample lacks timestamps across days and variations in activity types, leaving uninformative. Since only one type of fraud check exists in this narrow view, it appears most common, but full visibility across 31 days may reveal a lower frequency, leading to an inaccurate representation of actual workload.
