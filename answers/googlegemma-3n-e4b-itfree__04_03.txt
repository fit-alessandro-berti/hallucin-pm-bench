**Yes**

Justification:

1. **Rule 1:** `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) both occur once each and in that order. The trace shows QE followed by RA.
2. **Rule 2:** The case-level attribute `severity = "High"`, so `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA, which it does in the trace.
3. **Rule 3:** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs after QE and RA, which is the case in the trace.
4. **Rule 4:** `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after NA. Although rule 2 mandates VP after QE and RA, the trace includes VP after RA and before CC which is a valid sequence. Therefore CC can occur after NA.
