1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1 time** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate frequency because:
- The excerpt is temporally limited (only a few morning hours on one day).
- It contains just three cases, which is not representative of monthly volume or case-type distribution.
- The log shows process variability (e.g., Case 1001 had an automatic check, Case 1002 a manual one). A small sample cannot reliably show the true proportion of cases requiring manual checks versus automatic ones.
