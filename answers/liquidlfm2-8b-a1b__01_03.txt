**a)**  
- The Loan starts with receiving Form 14B; no credit data is pulled beyond this.  
- A Deck Officer performs a Tri-Color-Risk-Check using Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow to assign a risk rating of Low, Medium, or High.  
- If risk is Low or Medium and requested loan amount ≤ €250,000, the process skips further review.  
- Otherwise, a Manual-Underwriting-Review is conducted, producing a Decisional TriVote requiring at least two out of three approvals: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer.  
- Upon "TriVote" approval, Loan Dossier 2025 is finalized, including the Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration.  
- Finally, the applicant confirms the offer via signed Offer Sheet 77 and filled ID Matrix Declaration to close.
