Question 1: Yes.  
Question 2: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.  

*Explanation*:  
T1 fires (P0→P1,P2), then T2 (P1→P3), then T7 (P3→P4), then T4 (P4→P5). At this point, P2 and P5 are marked (P2 from T1, unused by T3), so T5 fires (P2,P5→P6) *before* T3 can fire. T3 never fires in this sequence, satisfying "before T3" as T5 fires when T3 has not yet occurred. This 5-transition sequence is minimal, as T5 requires P5 (obtained via T4→T7→T2→T1) without T3.
