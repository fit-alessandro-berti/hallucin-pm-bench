## 1️⃣ Occurrence Count
The exact activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** appears **1 time** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002, 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).

## 2️⃣ Risk of Misestimation

An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate manual fraud check prevalence because:

**Label variation**: The log contains inconsistent activity naming—"Automatic Fraud Check," "Manual Fraud Check," and "Fraud Check (Automatic)" appear. If the full March log uses additional variants (e.g., "Manual Fraud Review," "FraudCheck_Manual"), this excerpt undercounts the true frequency.

**Sampling bias**: This 14-event slice covers ~100 minutes on one morning with only 3 cases. The full month contains thousands of cases across different times, days, and loan types. Manual checks may cluster during specific shifts, risk profiles, or system outages not represented here.

**Process drift**: March 1st behavior may not reflect month-wide patterns if fraud-check routing rules changed mid-month.
