### Added Tasks
- **Task_VerifyIdentity**: A new task named "Verify Identity" has been added after the Start Event and before the "Review Application" task.
- **Task_RequestDocs**: A new task named "Request Additional Documents" has been added as an outcome of the decision gateway.
- **Task_FinalReject**: A new task named "Final Reject" has been added as another outcome of the decision gateway.

### Removed Tasks
- **Task_RejectLoan**: The task named "Reject Loan" from BPMN_v1, which was an outcome of the decision gateway for the "no" path, has been removed.

### Gateway-Type Changes
- **Gateway_Decision**: The gateway type has changed from `exclusiveGateway` in BPMN_v1 to `inclusiveGateway` in BPMN_v2, reflecting a shift from an XOR decision (one path only) to an OR decision (multiple paths possible).
