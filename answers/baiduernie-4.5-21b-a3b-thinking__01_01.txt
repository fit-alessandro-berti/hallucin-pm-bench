To address the query, we focus on **decision points** (points where choices are made, leading to different paths) and **required documents** (inputs/outputs mentioned in the process description), while adhering to the constraints and avoiding undefined activities.


### **Decision Points**  
Decision points are activities where a choice (or conditional evaluation) occurs, influencing the process flow:  
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: Decides if the claim is eligible (based on `FlightManifest` and `WeatherReport`).  
2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: Decides to pre-approve the refund (using `EligibilityChecklist`).  
3. **Senior_Auditor_Review**: Decides approval for high-value claims (requires `AuditTrail` for claims >â‚¬1,000).  
4. **Process_Refund_Payment**: Decides to execute payment (only after `Finance_Controller_PreApprove` succeeds and, for high-value claims, `Senior_Auditor_Review` is completed).  


### **Required Documents**  
Documents are explicitly referenced as inputs/outputs in the process steps:  
1. `RefundRequestForm` (submitted by customer in Step 1).  
2. `FlightManifest` (used in Step 2 for eligibility validation).  
3. `WeatherReport` (used in Step 2 for eligibility validation).  
4. `EligibilityChecklist` (used in Step 3 for pre-approval).  
5. `BankTransferAuthorization` (required input for Step 5).  
6. `AuditTrail` (required for Step 4 in high-value claims).  
7. `RefundConfirmationPDF` (output of Step 6, sent to passenger).  


### **Summary**  
- **Decision Points**: 4 (eligibility, pre-approval, high-value approval, payment execution).  
- **Required Documents**: 7 (all inputs/outputs from process steps, with `AuditTrail` added for high-value claims).  

No undefined activities or artifacts are introduced.
