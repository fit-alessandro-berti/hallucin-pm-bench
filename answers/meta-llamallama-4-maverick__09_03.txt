1. Computing the average cycle time of "Approve Invoice" is not possible with the given information. The event-log stub (Artefact A) has all the row values and timestamp details redacted, so we cannot access the start and complete times for the "Approve Invoice" activity.

2. Similarly, calculating the standard deviation and a 95% confidence interval for the cycle time of "Approve Invoice" cannot be done due to the lack of actual data in the event-log stub.

3. The reason we cannot compute any of these metrics is that Artefact A, the event-log stub, has been completely redacted, with all data rows and timestamp values removed, leaving only the column headers. Without the actual start and complete timestamps for the "Approve Invoice" activity, we cannot perform the required calculations.
