1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ The snippet contains only 3 cases on March 1, offering insufficient data for monthly generalization. The log reveals inconsistent activity naming for similar processes: "Automatic Fraud Check" (1001), "Fraud Check (Automatic)" (1003), and "Manual Fraud Check" (1002). This variance implies that searching strictly for "Manual Fraud Check" may miss related activities logged differently. Additionally, the data covers a single day's short duration. Manual checks might occur on other days not represented in this excerpt. Relying on this subset risks undercounting due to naming inconsistencies and temporal bias within the provided event log.
