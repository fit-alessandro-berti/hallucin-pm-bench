No  
**Justification:**  
• **Rule 1 violated:** `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) must occur before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), but in the trace, RA happens after QE.  
• **Rule 3 violated:** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before RA is complete, whereas NA must be performed only after both QE **and** RA are complete.  
• Rule 2 is satisfied because for a "High" severity case, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA (even though RA appears later in the sequence).  
• Rule 4 is satisfied because `Close_Case` occurs after NA and VP.  

Thus, the trace is non-compliant due to violations of Rule 1 and Rule 3.
