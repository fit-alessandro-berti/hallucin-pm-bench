### Q1: How many **distinct cases** are present in this fragment?

To determine the number of distinct cases, we need to look at the `case` attribute in each event.

- C001
- C002
- C003

There are **3 distinct cases** present in the fragment.

### Q2: For case **“C002”**, list the **sequence of activities** in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).

For case "C002", the sequence of activities is as follows:

1. Receive_Order
2. Check_Stock
3. Arrange_Delivery
4. Ship_Order

So, the sequence is:
```
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
```

### Q3: Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

To find the activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order", we look at the events before "Ship_Order" in the log:

- For case "C001": Check_Stock → Ship_Order
- For case "C002": Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
- For case "C003": Check_Stock → Ship_Order

The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
- Check_Stock
- Arrange_Delivery

Alphabetically ordered, the list is:
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
