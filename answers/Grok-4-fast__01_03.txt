### a) Decision Points
- **Post-Tri-Color-Risk-Check Conditional Branch**: If the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, the process skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review step.
- **TriVote Decision Gate**: The process advances only if at least two out of the three required approvals (from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) are obtained.
