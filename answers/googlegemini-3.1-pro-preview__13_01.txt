Based on the explicitly provided event-log fragment, here are the answers to your questions:

**1. Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**
It occurs exactly **1** time.

**2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent?**
There are 18 total logged events in the fragment. 
(1 ÷ 18) × 100 = 5.555...
Rounded to two decimal places, this represents **5.56%** of all logged events.

**3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**
**A1002**

**4. Give two sampling-related reasons why estimating the monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable.**
*   **Sample Size is Too Small:** The fragment only contains 4 cases (18 total events). This sample is statistically insufficient to generalize the frequency of a rare or conditional event over an entire month.
*   **Timeframe / Selection Bias:** All the sampled cases occur within a narrow ~5-hour window on a single day (May 1, 2025). This sampling frame fails to capture normal business fluctuations, such as variations between different days of the week, nighttime vs. daytime orders, or end-of-month spikes.
