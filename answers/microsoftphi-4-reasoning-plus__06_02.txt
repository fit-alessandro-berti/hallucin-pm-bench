We are asked given "only consider Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing". The process is described as:

Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing:
1. Accept_Custom_Order  
2. (Parallel Block P1) -> Generate_CAD_Drawing || Confirm_Materials_Availability  
3. Once P1 completes → (Parallel Block P2) -> Milling_Panels || Turning_Legs || CNC_Detailing  
4. Dry_Fit_Assembly  
5. Glue_And_Clamp  
6. (Parallel Block P3) -> Sand_Surfaces || Apply_Stain || Install_Hardware  
7. Final_Inspection  

I must list all sets of tasks that execute concurrently. According to the description, tasks that are parallel are: tasks in the first parallel block P1: "Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability". And tasks in the second parallel block P2: "Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing". And tasks in the third parallel block P3: "Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware". Also might need mention concurrent tasks from after phases? Let's re-read description: Provided process graph: Step2: (Parallel Block P1) consisting of two tasks: "Generate_CAD_Drawing" and "Confirm_Materials_Availability" which can run concurrently; Step3: dependent on parallel block's finish, then concurrently run the tasks in parallel block P2, i.e., "Milling_Panels", "Turning_Legs", "CNC_Detailing" run concurrently; Step6: (Parallel Block P3) start tasks "Sand_Surfaces", "Apply_Stain", "Install_Hardware" concurrently. The question is: "Only considering *Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing*", enumerate every set of tasks that may execute concurrently. So answer: number them as multiple blocks lines? However direct instruction: Return answer as numbered lines; in each line list the tasks of one parallel block separated by commas. I must not mention tasks from Process A and C. Also exclude tasks that run sequentially. Tasks from sequential steps such as "Accept_Custom_Order", "Dry_Fit_Assembly", "Glue_And_Clamp" etc.

So answer: 
1) Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability.
2) Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing.
3) Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

I must check at which tasks appear in description: "Accept_Custom_Order" is sequential task; next, parallel block P1 tasks, then once P1 done, sequential "Dry_Fit_Assembly" then "Glue_And_Clamp" then parallel block P3 tasks "Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware" then "Final_Inspection". The question instructs "only include tasks from parallel blocks", not include tasks that must run sequentially so discard sequential tasks. But the words "only considering Process B" are to include tasks for that one process. Only parallel blocks given in Process B: "Parallel Block P1", "Parallel Block P2", "Parallel Block P3." So return precisely such answers.

It said "enumerate every set of tasks that may execute concurrently", so answer exactly three lines for three blocks.

Return answer as numbered lines with tasks separated by comma. No mentions of steps that are not concurrently executing tasks. The answer should be: "1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability; 2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing; 3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware." Which is not code block, use maybe plain text lines enumerations. I can list them exactly as "1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability" etc.

Thus answer. Additionally check enumerations are exactly in parallel blocks as defined in Process description B: Blocks are P1: two tasks concurrently run, then P2: three tasks concurrently run, then P3: three tasks concurrently run. (We must confirm one set. Let's check P1: "Generate_CAD_Drawing" and "Confirm_Materials_Availability". P2: "Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing". P3: "Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware.")

None of the sequential tasks fall under parallel groups. Keep ordering as provided. We might check order: not to mention any extra info.

I'll produce answer as required. Use plain text numbering lines and separate with no extra additional text.

Thus I'll produce final answer.

I'll produce answer exactly as: "1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability", then "2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing", then "3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware". I'll produce answer in separate lines. Let me produce answer with instructions: only consider that.

I'll produce answer: one per line: "1. ..." Then "2. ..." Then "3. ..." Exactly.

I'll produce final answer. We'll produce answer as instructed.

I'll produce answer final message.1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware
