**Executive Memo: Process-Performance Review – Critical Delays by Waiting Time**  

Orion Insurance’s process audit reveals three key bottlenecks by waiting time:  
1. **Fraud_Check** averages 7.8 hours (95th percentile: 16.4 hours) — longest delay, requiring immediate action.  
2. **Request_Documents** averages 36.5 hours (95th percentile: 120.0 hours), trailing only Fraud_Check, with high variability.  
3. **Assess_Liability** averages 7.8 hours (95th percentile: 16.4 hours), exhibiting costly leniency at the upper end.  

To reduce delays by ≥20%:  
- Fraud_Check: Implement automated risk-scoring AI to pre-filter low-risk claims → target 20% faster triage.  
- Request_Documents: Deploy real-time document status tracking and automated reminders → reduce top 95th percentile wait time.  
- Assess_Liability: Enforce strict SLAs with mandatory review check-ins at 4-hour intervals → cut variance and lower top delays.  

Action on these will drive meaningful efficiency gains across critical claim pathways.
