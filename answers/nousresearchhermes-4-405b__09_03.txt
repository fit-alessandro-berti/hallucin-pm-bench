1. The average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval for the activity “Approve Invoice” cannot be computed from the supplied data.

2. This is because Artefact A is an event‐log stub with all rows and timestamps entirely redacted. Without access to the individual start_time and complete_time values for each “Approve Invoice” occurrence, there is no way to calculate the duration of the activity (or any of the derived statistics). In addition, while Artefact B provides a related metric (the average time from “Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice”), it does not contain cycle time information for the “Approve Invoice” activity itself.

Since no numerical values are available in the redacted artefacts, the requested metrics cannot be determined.
