**Answer 1.** Yes.  
**Answer 2.** Minimal sequence: **T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5**.  

After T1 (AND-split), P2 holds a token. While T3 is idle, the upper path (T2→T7→T4) fills P5. T5 then fires using the *original* P2 token (untouched by T3) and P5, before T3 ever triggers. T3 is not required for P5’s creation here (P4 comes from T7, not T3). This exploits concurrency: P2 persists until consumed by T5, bypassing T3.
