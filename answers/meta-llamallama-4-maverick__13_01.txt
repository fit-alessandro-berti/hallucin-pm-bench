I'll be happy to help you with the questions.

### 1. Frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check"

To determine the frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check", I'll examine the log lines.

Upon reviewing the log, I see that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs only once in the entire fragment (for case A1002).

**Answer:** The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs exactly **1** time.

### 2. Percentage of logged events

To calculate the percentage, I'll divide the frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check" by the total number of logged events and multiply by 100.

There are 18 log lines in total. The frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check" is 1.

Percentage = (1 / 18) Ã— 100 = 5.56%

**Answer:** The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" represents **5.56%** of all logged events.

### 3. Case identifiers containing "Manual_Fraud_Check"

I'll scan the log to find the case identifier(s) associated with "Manual_Fraud_Check".

The log shows that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs only for case **A1002**.

**Answer:** The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is **A1002**.

### 4. Sampling-related reasons for unreliability

The data scientist is using the given fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Here are two sampling-related reasons why this estimate may be unreliable:

1. **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 18 log lines, which is a relatively small sample size. This limited data may not be representative of the actual monthly frequency of manual fraud checks.
2. **Limited time window**: The log lines are from a single day (2025-05-01). This may not capture variations in the frequency of manual fraud checks that occur over a longer period, such as monthly or seasonal fluctuations.

**Answer:** Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable are: (1) small sample size and (2) limited time window.
