**Non-compliant**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity #4), which makes `Quality_Check` optional but mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`**. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at activity #8, but `Risk_Assessment` occurs at activity #9 (after `Ship_Goods`). This is a direct violation.

2. **Rule 4 violation**: Activity #7 (`Move_to_Quality`, executed by **Intern**) directly follows activity #3 (`Approve_PO_CFO`, executed by **CFO**). Rule 4 explicitly prohibits any activity executed by an Intern from directly following an activity executed by the CFO.
