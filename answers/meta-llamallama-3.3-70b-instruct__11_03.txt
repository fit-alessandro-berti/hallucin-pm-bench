To: Orion Credit's COO

The analysis of our current process performance reveals that three activities are particularly underperforming, both in terms of breaching their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and high waiting times. These activities are Legal Approval, Credit Assessment, and Risk Review. Legal Approval exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds, Credit Assessment by 60 seconds, and Risk Review by 300 seconds. High waiting times are also observed in these activities, with Legal Approval having an average waiting time of 600 seconds, Credit Assessment of 200 seconds, and Risk Review of 480 seconds. 
* Implement process automation for Legal Approval to reduce waiting time and increase throughput.
* Increase staffing for Credit Assessment to handle cases more efficiently and reduce waiting times.
* Streamline the Risk Review process by introducing parallel processing to reduce the average waiting time and throughput time.
