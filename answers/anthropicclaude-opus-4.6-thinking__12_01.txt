## The claim is **false**.

The event log contradicts it in every case where both activities appear, and one case lacks `Update_Inventory` entirely:

| Case | Ordering of the two activities | Immediately adjacent? |
|------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **1001** | `Update_Inventory` (08:25:55) → `Authorize_Refund` (08:30:02) | The order is **reversed**: Update_Inventory comes *before* Authorize_Refund, not after. |
| **1002** | `Authorize_Refund` (10:18:40) occurs, but **`Update_Inventory` never appears** | The claimed pair doesn't exist at all. |
| **1003** | `Update_Inventory` (10:08:07) → `Quality_Check` → `Authorize_Refund` (10:22:18) | Again **reversed**, and they are **not** immediately adjacent (Quality_Check intervenes). |

### Summary of violations

1. **Ordering is inverted** — In Cases 1001 and 1003, `Update_Inventory` precedes `Authorize_Refund`, the opposite of what the claim asserts.
2. **Not always present** — In Case 1002, `Update_Inventory` does not occur, so the "always" condition fails.
3. **Not immediately adjacent** — Even ignoring order, the two activities are never directly next to each other in Case 1003.

There is **no case** in this log fragment that supports the stated claim.
