**TO:** Chief Operating Officer
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**SUBJECT:** Analysis of Application Process Bottlenecks

This analysis highlights the three worst-performing activities based on Service Level Agreement (SLA) breaches and high average waiting times. The Legal Approval activity, with an average throughput time of 900 seconds, exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds. Risk Reviewâ€™s 600-second throughput time also surpasses its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds. Credit Assessment's throughput time of 300 seconds breaches its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds. For these activities, the average waiting time is the largest component of the total throughput time.

To address these critical bottlenecks, the following actions are recommended:
*   **Legal Approval:** Focus resources on reducing the 600-second average waiting time, which accounts for 67% of its total throughput time.
*   **Risk Review:** Prioritize lowering the 480-second average waiting time, as it constitutes 80% of its throughput time.
*   **Credit Assessment:** Target the 200-second average waiting time, which makes up 67% of its total throughput time.
