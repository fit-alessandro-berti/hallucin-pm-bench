Here’s the summary you asked for, following **exactly** the Micro-loan Fast-Track terminology.

## **Decision Points**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   • If Senior Underwriter A’s score and Shadow Underwriter B’s score differ by **≤ 2 points** → continue to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.  
   • If difference **> 2 points** → escalate to **Harmonisation Committee** for tie-break → then continue.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   • If **amount < €15 000** → system auto-approves.  
   • If **amount ≥ €15 000** → proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** where the Board votes *approve* or *reject*.

If you like, I can also create a **flow diagram** highlighting just these decision points and required document checks for the Fast-Track variant. Would you like me to do that?
