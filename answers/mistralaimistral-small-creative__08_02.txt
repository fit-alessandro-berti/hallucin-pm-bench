**Answer 1:** No, **T5** cannot fire before **T3** in any reachable marking.

**Explanation (≤120 words):**
T5 requires tokens in **P2** and **P5**. **P2** is produced by **T1** (AND-split), but **P5** depends on **T4**, which consumes **P4**. **P4** is produced by **T3** (consuming **P2**) or **T7** (consuming **P3**). Since **T7** requires **T2** (which depends on **T1**’s **P1**), **P5** can only be produced *after* **T3** fires (via **T4**). Thus, **T5**’s precondition (**P2** and **P5**) cannot hold until **T3** has fired. The net enforces this order.
