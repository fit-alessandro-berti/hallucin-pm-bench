### 1) Average cycle time of "Review Contract" across all cases in the log:
**Data unavailable** for "Review Contract" in the log.

### 2) Explanation:
The event log only shows the sequence of activities and which resource performed them, but it does not include the duration (elapsed time) for each activity. The timestamps and elapsed-time fields are redacted, so we cannot calculate the cycle time for "Review Contract" (or any other activity) from this data. The historical benchmarks provided are for unrelated cases and cannot be used to estimate the cycle time for this log. Thus, the requested value cannot be derived from the given information.
