MEMORANDUM

TO: Chief Operating Officer
FROM: Orion Credit – Senior Process-Performance Analyst
DATE: October 26, 2023
SUBJECT: Process Performance – Urgent Attention Required

This memo highlights three critical areas of process performance requiring immediate attention. Based on current data, Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment are significantly underperforming, exceeding their Target SLAs and exhibiting substantial waiting times.

Risk Review’s average throughput time of 600 seconds exceeds its Target SLA of 300 seconds by 300 seconds, compounded by an average waiting time of 480 seconds. Legal Approval’s average throughput time of 900 seconds surpasses its Target SLA of 600 seconds by 300 seconds, alongside a noteworthy average waiting time of 600 seconds. Finally, Credit Assessment’s average throughput time of 300 seconds exceeds its Target SLA of 240 seconds by 60 seconds, with an average waiting time of 200 seconds.

To address these issues, I recommend the following:

*   **Risk Review:** Investigate potential bottlenecks in the review process through direct observation and process mapping.
*   **Legal Approval:** Explore options for streamlining the approval workflow, potentially through knowledge-based systems or legal templates.
*   **Credit Assessment:** Analyze the data utilized in Credit Assessment to determine if simpler models or automation can reduce processing time.
