1) Cannot be derived from the provided data.

2) Explanation:
- The log snippet has no timestamps or elapsed-time fields (explicitly redacted), which are required to compute the cycle time of “Review Contract.”
- The historical benchmark provided does not include “Review Contract” and is from a different segment, so it cannot be used to infer the duration.
- While “Review Contract” appears in the shown cases (C-001 to C-004), without per-instance durations we cannot compute an average. To calculate it, we would need start/end timestamps or an elapsed-time field for each “Review Contract” event and then average those durations.
