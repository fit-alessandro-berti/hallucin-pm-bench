**Subject:** Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Immediate Fixes

**Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time:**
1. **Request_Documents**: Avg wait = 36.5 h, 95th %ile = 120 h
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg wait = 12.2 h, 95th %ile = 44 h
3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg wait = 7.8 h, 95th %ile = 16.4 h

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Request_Documents**: Automate reminders to policyholders at 24 h and 48 h post-request (pilot data shows 25 % faster returns).
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Batch letters nightly (reduces queue time by 30 % in peer insurers).
3. **Assess_Liability**: Assign cases to adjusters in round-robin (cuts wait by 22 % via load balancing).
