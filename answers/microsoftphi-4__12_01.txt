The fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment.

Justification:
- In Case 1001, "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Update_Inventory": 
  1. Update_Inventory: 08:25:55
  2. Authorize_Refund: 08:30:02

- In Case 1002, "Authorize_Refund" occurs without "Update_Inventory" before it.

- In Case 1003, "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Update_Inventory" and "Quality_Check":
  1. Update_Inventory: 10:08:07
  2. Quality_Check: 10:15:42
  3. Authorize_Refund: 10:22:18

In none of the cases does "Authorize_Refund" occur immediately before "Update_Inventory." In fact, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund" in Cases 1001 and 1003, while Case 1002 does not include an "Update_Inventory" activity before "Authorize_Refund." Therefore, the statement is false based on the event-log fragment.
