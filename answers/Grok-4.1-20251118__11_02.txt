**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Process – Key Bottlenecks  

The Claims Handling process shows three clear under-performing activities:

1. **Request Documents** – Worst performer. Throughput drops to 190/day (vs. ~280 at start), driven by an extreme average wait time of 150 minutes. High rework (22%) further amplifies the bottleneck.  
   **Action:** Implement automated document checklists and pre-emptive requests at Initial Assessment to reduce incomplete submissions and cut wait time.

2. **Review Documents** – Second-worst. Throughput falls further to 185/day, with long processing time (25 min), high variability (9 min stdev), and 12.4% SLA breaches.  
   **Action:** Introduce standardised review templates and targeted training for high-variability reviewers to reduce average time and variability by at least 20–30%.

3. **Initial Assessment** – Notable early friction point. Highest SLA breach rate after Review Documents (3.2%) and elevated wait time (18 min) despite reasonable processing time.  
   **Action:** Add priority queuing rules or shift staffing to smooth arrival peaks and bring wait time below 10 minutes.

Addressing these three activities will unlock significant capacity and SLA improvement across the entire process.
