Here's my analysis of all changes between the BPMN versions under the specified headings:

• Added tasks:
- "Verify Identity" (Task_VerifyIdentity)
- "Request Additional Documents" (Task_RequestDocs)

• Removed tasks:
- "Reject Loan" (Task_RejectLoan) was replaced by "Final Reject" (Task_FinalReject)

• Gateway-type changes:
- The gateway "Gateway_Decision" was changed from exclusive (exclusiveGateway) to inclusive (inclusiveGateway)

I observed the task rename from "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan" but excluded it as per instructions to ignore cosmetic renaming. Similarly, I focused only on structural changes to the process, not flow reordering or ID changes.
