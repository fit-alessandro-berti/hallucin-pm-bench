**Answer:**  
Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before **T3**.  

**Shortest firing sequence:**  
`T1 → T2b → T4 → T5`  

**Explanation:**  
1. **T1** fires first (enabled by the initial token in **p0**), producing tokens in **pa** and **pb**.  
2. **T2b** fires (enabled by **pa**), producing a token in **pd**.  
3. **T4** fires (enabled by **pb**), producing a token in **pe**.  
4. **T5** fires (enabled by **pd** and **pe**), producing a token in **pf**.  

At this point, **T3** (which requires **pc**) has not yet fired, as **pc** remains empty (no transition has produced a token there yet). Thus, **T5** fires before **T3**.  

This sequence is minimal, as **T1** must fire first, and both **T2b** and **T4** are required to enable **T5**.
