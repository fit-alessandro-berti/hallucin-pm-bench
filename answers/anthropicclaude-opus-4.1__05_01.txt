To enforce the 48-hour SLA, attach a **boundary timer event** to `Task_RequestDocs` (the only task that could delay reaching `Task_Triage`). Configure this timer for 48 hours from process start, and set it as interrupting. When triggered, it should bypass the document request and flow directly to `Task_Triage`.

Specifically:
- Add an interrupting boundary timer event on `Task_RequestDocs`
- Create a sequence flow from this timer event to `Task_Triage`
- This ensures that even if documents are missing, the claim auto-escalates to triage within 48 hours

This modification guarantees SLA compliance by preventing the process from being stuck waiting for missing documents beyond the deadline.
