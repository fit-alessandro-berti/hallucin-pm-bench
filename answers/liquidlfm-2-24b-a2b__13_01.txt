### 4. Sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable:
**(a) Non-representative sample:**  
The log fragment only covers a small, specific time window (May 1, 2025), so it may not reflect the overall monthly frequency of manual fraud checks.

**(b) Limited sample size:**  
With only 18 events in total, the sample is too small to generalize to the entire month, especially if the process is not uniformly active throughout the month.

**Answers:**  
- The sample is too small to be representative of the whole month.
- The events are not evenly distributed over time; the fragment may miss periods with higher or lower frequency of manual fraud checks.
