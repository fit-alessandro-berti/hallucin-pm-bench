Here is the RACI matrix in Markdown format using the authorized vocabulary:

|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------ |
| Intake Vetting    | R                    |                    |                   |            |
| KYC Review        |                     | R, A              |                   |            |
| AML Screening     |                     | R                 |                   |            |
| Risk Scoring      |                     | R                 | C                 |            |
| (Escalation)      |                     | C                 | A                 |            |
| (Non-escalation)  |                     | I                 | I                 | R, A        |

**Key:**
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)
- **A** = Accountable (approves or signs off)
- **C** = Consulted (needs to provide input)
- **I** = Informed (notified of outcome)

*Note: Activities in parentheses (Escalation / Non-escalation) are conditional outcomes of Risk Scoring.*
