### **Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process**

1. **Triage Agent – Eligibility Validation**  
   - **Decision**: Determine whether the claimant is eligible for a refund.  
   - **Basis**: Verification against the *FlightManifest* (to confirm flight and passenger details) and *WeatherReport* (to assess if cancellation was due to covered causes).  
   - **Outcome**: Proceed to *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* if eligible; otherwise, claim is rejected (no further process defined here).

2. **Finance Controller – Pre-Approval Decision**  
   - **Decision**: Approve or reject the refund claim based on compliance with policy.  
   - **Basis**: Review and completion of the *EligibilityChecklist*.  
   - **Outcome**: If approved, the case proceeds.  
     - If refund amount ≤ €1 000: proceed to *Process_Refund_Payment*.  
     - If refund amount > €1 000: route to *Senior_Auditor_Review*.

3. **Senior Auditor – High-Value Claim Review**  
   - **Decision**: Approve or reject high-value refund claims (amount > €1 000).  
   - **Basis**: Audit assessment using the *AuditTrail* to ensure compliance, legitimacy, and traceability.  
   - **Outcome**: If approved, proceed to *Process_Refund_Payment*; otherwise, claim is rejected.
