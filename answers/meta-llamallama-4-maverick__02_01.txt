To answer the given questions based on the provided XES event log fragment, let's analyze the information step by step.

### Q1. How many distinct case IDs appear in the fragment?

To determine the number of distinct case IDs, we need to identify all unique `case:id` values in the log.

1. The given log contains the following `case:id` values:
   - A-9321
   - B-1045
   - C-77

2. Counting the unique `case:id` values: 
   - A-9321 appears multiple times.
   - B-1045 appears multiple times.
   - C-77 appears once.

There are 3 distinct `case:id` values.

### Q2. Which activity immediately precedes `"Ship_Order"` in case A-9321?

To find the activity that immediately precedes `"Ship_Order"` in case A-9321, we need to look at the events for A-9321 and their timestamps.

1. Events for A-9321 in chronological order are:
   - Receive_Order at 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00
   - Validate_Order at 2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00
   - Pack_Items at 2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00
   - Ship_Order at 2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00

2. The event immediately before `"Ship_Order"` is `"Pack_Items"`.

### Q3. What is the earliest timestamp in the fragment (ISO-8601 format)?

To find the earliest timestamp, we compare the `time:timestamp` values of all events.

1. Timestamps in the log are:
   - 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T08:17:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T09:10:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T09:25:00.000+00:00
   - 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00

2. The earliest timestamp is `2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00`.

### Q4. How many times does the activity `"Quality_Check"` occur?

To determine how many times `"Quality_Check"` occurs, we count the occurrences of this activity in the log.

1. `"Quality_Check"` appears for:
   - B-1045 at 2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00
   - C-77 at 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00

2. The total count of `"Quality_Check"` is 2.

### Q5. List every activity that never appears as the first event of any case.

To identify activities that never appear as the first event of any case, we need to:
1. Identify the first event for each case.
2. List activities that are not among these first events.

First events for each case:
- A-9321: Receive_Order
- B-1045: Receive_Order
- C-77: Quality_Check

Activities that are first events:
- Receive_Order (for A-9321 and B-1045)
- Quality_Check (for C-77)

All activities in the log:
- Receive_Order
- Validate_Order
- Pack_Items
- Quality_Check
- Ship_Order

Activities that never appear as the first event:
- Validate_Order
- Pack_Items
- Ship_Order
