3. Low-support activities like Manual_Fraud_Check (1/48 events, 1/12 cases) rarely occur in this slice. Generalizing inflates their perceived frequency or impact, skewing performance metrics (e.g., overestimating fraud-check bottlenecks in averages) or predictive models (e.g., poor generalization, overfitting to the outlier C05 path). This slice may not represent full-log patterns, leading to misleading insights on process efficiency or risks. (68 words)
