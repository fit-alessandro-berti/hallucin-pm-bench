No. The claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order* is not accurate. For example, case C001 has *Validate_Payment* (line 2) occurring before *Receive_Order* (line 1), which contradicts the statement. Additionally, case C003 shows *Validate_Payment* (line 6) occurring before *Receive_Order* (line 7). These instances demonstrate that *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order*.
