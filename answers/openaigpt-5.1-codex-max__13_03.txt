1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in the excerpt.

2️⃣ This snippet covers only 3 cases and 14 events from a single morning (2025‑03‑01), so it’s far too small and time‑limited to infer monthly frequencies. It also shows multiple fraud‑check labels (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) and incomplete lifecycles (duplicate “Send Offer” for case 1001), making it unclear whether processes are fully captured or consistently named. With such limited and potentially non‑representative data, any estimate of how common manual fraud checks are across the full month would be unreliable.
