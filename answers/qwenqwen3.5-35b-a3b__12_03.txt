**No.**

**Justification:**
The fact is inaccurate because there are cases in the log where other activities occur between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.

*   **Case C002:** The activity sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment`. Here, `Pack_Items` occurs between the payment validation and the order receipt.
*   **Case C004:** The activity sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment` → `Pack_Items`. Here, `Check_Fraud` occurs between the order receipt and the payment validation.

Since the activity `Validate_Payment` does not occur **immediately** after `Receive_Order` in all instances (specifically C002 and C004), the claim is false.
