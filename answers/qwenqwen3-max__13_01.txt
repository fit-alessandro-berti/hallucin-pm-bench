1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs exactly **1** time in this fragment.

2. Total number of logged events = 18  
Occurrences of “Manual_Fraud_Check” = 1  
Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ **5.56%**

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is: **A1002**

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:  
   - **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 18 events across 4 cases, which is insufficient to generalize to a monthly frequency.  
   - **Non-representative time window**: The data covers only a single day (2025-05-01), which may not reflect typical monthly variation (e.g., weekends, holidays, or seasonal trends).
