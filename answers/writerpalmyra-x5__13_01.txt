1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs exactly **1** time in this fragment.

2. There are 18 total events in the log. One instance of "Manual_Fraud_Check" represents:  
   $ \frac{1}{18} \approx 0.0556 $ → **5.56%** (rounded to two decimal places).

3. The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is:  
   **A1002**

4. Two sampling-related reasons why using this fragment to estimate monthly frequency is unreliable:  
   - **Insufficient sample size**: The log contains only 18 events across 4 cases, which is too small to reliably estimate the frequency of a relatively rare event like manual fraud checks.  
   - **Lack of temporal representativeness**: The data covers only a single day (2025-05-01), so it may not capture variations in fraud-check patterns across different days, weeks, or months (e.g., weekends, peak periods, policy changes).
