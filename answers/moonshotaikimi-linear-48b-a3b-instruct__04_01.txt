**Answer: Non-compliant**  
**Justification:**  
1. **Rules 1 & 2 are satisfied**, but rule 4 is violated: activity `Move_to_Quality` (executed by *Intern*) directly follows activity `Approve_PO_CFO` (executed by *CFO*), which is forbidden.  
2. **Rule 3 is violated**: `Three_way_match` is not completed within the next two activities after `Goods_Received`. It is activity #10, while activity #9 (`Ship_Goods`) is already activity #8, making it more than two activities away.
