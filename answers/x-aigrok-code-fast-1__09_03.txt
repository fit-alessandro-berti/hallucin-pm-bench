I am unable to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity. The provided event-log stub contains only column headers with no actual event data, rows, or timestamp values, making it impossible to calculate any statistical metrics from the log. Artifact B does not provide sufficient event-level data or durations to compensate for this.
