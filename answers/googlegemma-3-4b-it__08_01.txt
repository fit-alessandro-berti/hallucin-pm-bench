Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

Here’s a concrete firing sequence demonstrating this:

1. **Initial Marking:** p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
2. **T1 Fires:** p0 → p1 + p2. Marking becomes: p0(0), p1(1), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
3. **T2 Fires:** p1 → p3. Marking becomes: p0(0), p1(0), p2(0), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
4. **T5 Fires:** p3 –|p4 → p6.  Since p4 has 0 tokens, T5 *can* fire. Marking becomes: p0(0), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1).
5. **T3 Fires:** p3 → p6. Marking becomes: p0(0), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0).

In this sequence, T5 (firing in step 4) occurs before T3 (firing in step 5).

**Justification:**

The crucial point is that T5 has an *inhibitor* arc from p4.  As long as p4 has zero tokens, T5 is enabled.  Since p4 is only consumed by T3, p4 will only contain zero tokens if T3 has *not* fired. This ensures that T5 can always fire before T3, unless T3 is already firing, which is impossible given the initial marking.
