**Notes**:  
- **R/A** = Role is both *Responsible* and *Accountable* (same for tasks where accountability and execution align).  
- **C** = Role must be *Consulted* for critical input (e.g., Transaction Analyst provides data for KYC Review).  
- **I** = Role must be kept *Informed* of progress or completion (e.g., Regulatory Liaison notified post-archiving).  
- **Gaps** (blank cells) indicate no formal involvement in that task.
