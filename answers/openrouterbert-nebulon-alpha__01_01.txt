### **Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process**

1. **Eligibility Decision (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility)**
   - **Decision:** Is the claim eligible for a refund based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?
   - **Outcome:** Proceed to *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* (if eligible) or reject (if ineligible).

2. **High-Value Threshold Check (Finance_Controller_PreApprove → Senior_Auditor_Review)**
   - **Decision:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1,000**?
   - **Outcome:**
     - If **≤ €1,000** → Proceed directly to *Process_Refund_Payment*.
     - If **> €1,000** → Requires *Senior_Auditor_Review* before payment.

3. **Payment Authorization (Process_Refund_Payment)**
   - **Decision:** Is the *BankTransferAuthorization* signed and available?
   - **Outcome:** Execute payment (if authorized) or wait (if not).
