**1.** 1  

**2.** 5.56 %  

**3.** A1002  

**4.** Two sampling‑related reasons the estimate would be unreliable:  

1. **Extremely small and non‑representative sample** – the fragment contains only one occurrence of “Manual_Fraud_Check” out of 18 total events, representing a single case (A1002). Such a tiny sample cannot capture the true monthly volume or variability of manual fraud checks across the whole process.  

2. **Temporal bias / lack of coverage of process dynamics** – the logged slice may correspond to an atypical time (e.g., a low‑traffic period or a one‑off order) and therefore does not reflect how often manual fraud checks are actually performed on a regular monthly basis; seasonal spikes, order‑size changes, or workflow alterations are omitted.  

*Both points pertain to sampling issues that undermine reliable frequency estimation.*
