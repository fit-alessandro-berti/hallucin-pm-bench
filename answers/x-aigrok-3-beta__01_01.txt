### Summary of Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**:  
   - Decision: The triage agent determines if the refund claim is eligible based on specific criteria.  
   - Outcome: If eligible, the claim proceeds to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**; if not, the process likely stops (rejection is implied but not explicitly defined in the process).

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**:  
   - Decision: The finance controller evaluates and signs off on the claim for pre-approval.  
   - Outcome: If pre-approved, the claim moves forward; for high-value claims (> €1,000), it goes to **Senior_Auditor_Review**; for others, it proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment** (subject to constraints); if not approved, the process likely stops (rejection is implied but not explicitly defined).

3. **High-Value Branch (Refund Amount > €1,000)**:  
   - Decision: A conditional check determines if the refund amount exceeds €1,000.  
   - Outcome: If the amount is greater than €1,000, the process branches to **Senior_Auditor_Review**; otherwise, it proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment** (after pre-approval).

4. **Senior_Auditor_Review (High-Value Claims Only)**:  
   - Decision: The senior auditor reviews the high-value claim to ensure compliance and accuracy.  
   - Outcome: If the review is successful, the claim proceeds to **Process_Refund_Payment**; if not, the process likely stops (rejection is implied but not explicitly defined).
