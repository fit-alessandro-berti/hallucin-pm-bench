Based on the provided Petri-net and initial marking, here is the analysis:

Yes, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

This possibility exists because of the "shortcut" transition **T2b**. This transition allows a token to be placed in `pd` without first passing through `pc`, which is the necessary precondition for firing `T3`.

### Shortest Firing Sequence

Here is one of the shortest firing sequences that results in `T5` firing before `T3`. The state of the net (marking) is shown after each step. Non-zero places are listed.

1.  **Initial Marking:** `M₀ = { p0=1 }`
    *   Only `T1` is enabled.

2.  **Fire T1:** Consumes 1 token from `p0`, produces 1 token in `pa` and 1 in `pb`.
    *   `M₁ = { pa=1, pb=1 }`
    *   Transitions `T2`, `T2b`, and `T4` are now enabled.

3.  **Fire T4:** Consumes 1 token from `pb`, produces 1 token in `pe`.
    *   `M₂ = { pa=1, pe=1 }`
    *   This fulfills one of the two preconditions for `T5`.

4.  **Fire T2b:** Consumes 1 token from `pa`, produces 1 token in `pd`.
    *   `M₃ = { pd=1, pe=1 }`
    *   This fulfills the second precondition for `T5`. At this point, `T5` is enabled. Notice that `T3` was never enabled because place `pc` never received a token.

5.  **Fire T5:** Consumes 1 token from `pd` and 1 from `pe`, produces 1 in `pf`.
    *   `M₄ = { pf=1 }`

The complete sequence is:
**T1, T4, T2b, T5**

*(Note: The sequence `T1, T2b, T4, T5` is also valid and equally short.)*
