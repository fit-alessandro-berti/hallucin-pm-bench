Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to enumerate all sets of tasks that can execute concurrently in Process B — Custom Furniture Manufacturing. They mentioned that tasks might share names across processes but serve different purposes, so I need to focus solely on Process B.

First, I'll look at the description of Process B. The steps are numbered, and some tasks are grouped in parallel blocks. Parallel blocks are indicated by "(Parallel Block P1)" followed by tasks separated by "||". Tasks within these blocks can run concurrently. I need to identify all such parallel blocks and list the tasks in each, separated by commas.

Let's go through each step:

1. Accept_Custom_Order – This is a single task, no parallel here.
2. (Parallel Block P1) → Generate_CAD_Drawing || Confirm_Materials_Availability – This is the first parallel block. The tasks here can run at the same time.
3. Once P1 completes → (Parallel Block P2) → Milling_Panels || Turning_Legs || CNC_Detailing – This is another parallel block with three tasks.
4. Dry_Fit_Assembly – Single task.
5. Glue_And_Clamp – Single task.
6. (Parallel Block P3) → Sand_Surfaces || Apply_Stain || Install_Hardware – Third parallel block with three tasks.
7. Final_Inspection – Single task.

So, the parallel blocks are P1, P2, and P3. Each of these blocks contains tasks that can execute concurrently. I need to list each set of tasks from these blocks as separate lines, with tasks separated by commas.

I should also make sure not to include tasks from Processes A or C, as per the user's instruction. Looking at the tasks in Process B, they are all unique to this process, so no overlap there. Also, exclude tasks that must run sequentially, but since the question is about parallel blocks, the tasks within those blocks are by definition concurrent. The other tasks (like Dry_Fit_Assembly) are sequential and not part of any parallel blocks, so they are correctly excluded.

Now, compiling the answer:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

Each line represents a parallel block, and the tasks within each block are listed separated by commas. This should be the correct enumeration of concurrent task sets in Process B.
1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware
