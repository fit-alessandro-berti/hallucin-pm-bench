# MEMO — Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance | **From:** Process Performance Analytics | **Date:** April 2025

## Three Critical Under-Performers

**1. Request_Documents**
This activity is the primary process bottleneck. Its 150-minute average wait time dwarfs every other step, signalling a severe capacity or dependency constraint. Throughput drops sharply here (270 → 190 cases/day), and a 22% rework rate indicates documents are repeatedly re-requested. **Action:** Implement a standardised, upfront document checklist at registration to reduce incomplete submissions and eliminate the majority of rework loops.

**2. Review_Documents**
This step carries the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), the longest processing time (25 min), and the greatest variability (σ = 9 min), pointing to inconsistent or overly complex review procedures. Rework is also elevated at 5.3%. **Action:** Introduce tiered review protocols—auto-approve low-complexity documents via rules engine, reserving manual review for exceptions—to cut both mean processing time and variability.

**3. Initial_Assessment**
Wait time (18 min) and SLA breaches (3.2%) are the highest among remaining activities, with moderate rework (1.8%) suggesting assessment criteria may be unclear. **Action:** Deploy a structured decision-support template with explicit assessment criteria to reduce rework and stabilise cycle time.

*Addressing these three activities would recover ~100 cases/day in throughput and materially reduce end-to-end cycle time.*
