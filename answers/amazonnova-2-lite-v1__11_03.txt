To the COO of Orion Credit,

Our analysis reveals three activities with significant SLA breaches and high waiting times: **Risk Review**, **Legal Approval**, and **Credit Assessment**.

- **Risk Review** exceeds its SLA by **300 seconds**, with an average waiting time of **480 seconds**.
- **Legal Approval** exceeds its SLA by **300 seconds**, with an average waiting time of **600 seconds**.
- **Credit Assessment** exceeds its SLA by **60 seconds**, with an average waiting time of **200 seconds**.

**Recommendations:**
- For **Risk Review**, increase staff allocation to reduce the throughput time from 600s to meet the 300s target.
- For **Legal Approval**, implement parallel review processes to cut the throughput time from 900s to within the 600s SLA.
- For **Credit Assessment**, streamline underwriting procedures to lower the throughput time from 300s to meet the 240s SLA.

These steps will directly address the most critical delays in our process.
