Alright, so the user is asking about Contoso Airlines' flight-refund process. Specifically, they want a summary of every decision point in the process and a list of all the required documents. They mentioned not to include any activities or artifacts not defined in the provided process.

First, I need to go through the given process steps and identify where the decision points are. Decision points are where the process branches into different paths based on certain conditions. From what's described, the main decision point seems to be at step 4: **High-value branch**, which checks if the refund amount is greater than €1,000. If it is, then it goes to **Senior_Auditor_Review**; if not, presumably, it moves directly to **Process_Refund_Payment** after the finance controller's approval.

Next, I need to list all the required documents. These are the artifacts mentioned in each step. Let's go through each step:

1. **Customer_Submit_Claim** involves the passenger completing a *RefundRequestForm*.
2. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** checks against the *FlightManifest* and the *WeatherReport*.
3. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** uses an *EligibilityChecklist*.
4. **High-value branch** doesn't introduce new documents, but the subsequent **Senior_Auditor_Review** requires the *AuditTrail*.
5. **Process_Refund_Payment** needs the *BankTransferAuthorization*.
6. **Issue_Confirmation_Letter** emails a *RefundConfirmationPDF*.

So the required documents are:
- RefundRequestForm
- FlightManifest
- WeatherReport
- EligibilityChecklist
- AuditTrail (only for high-value claims)
- BankTransferAuthorization
- RefundConfirmationPDF

Now, make sure not to include any activities or documents not mentioned. The user specifically noted that the "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" doesn't exist here, so ignore that. Also, the **Senior_Auditor_Review** is a conditional step based on the refund amount being over €1,000. Need to mention that clearly.

Decision points are where the process branches. The only explicit one is checking if the refund amount is greater than €1,000, leading to either the high-value branch or proceeding to payment. But other steps might have implicit checks, like validating eligibility against the FlightManifest and WeatherReport, but those don't explicitly "branch" the process; they just validate. So the main decision point is the value check.

List of documents should capture all the artifacts involved, noting which are conditionally required (like the AuditTrail for high-value claims). The *RefundConfirmationPDF* is sent in all cases once the refund is processed, so it's always required after successful payment and approval.
**Decision Points in Contoso's Process:**
1. **Refund Amount Check**  
   - If refund amount is **greater than €1,000**: Proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review**  
   - If refund amount is **≤€1,000**: Move directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**  

**Required Documents:**
1. *RefundRequestForm* (submitted by passenger)
2. *FlightManifest* (used for validation)
3. *WeatherReport* (used for validation)
4. *EligibilityChecklist* (for finance controller's approval)
5. *AuditTrail* (required for high-value claims ≥€1,000)
6. *BankTransferAuthorization* (for payment execution)
7. *RefundConfirmationPDF* (sent to passenger upon successful completion)

**Important Notes:**
- The *Senior_Auditor_Review* step and *AuditTrail* are only required for refunds greater than €1,000
- The legacy activity "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" is not part of Contoso's process
- All documents listed are explicitly defined in the process description, with no additions or assumptions made
