1️⃣ The exact string “Manual Fraud Check” appears once in this excerpt.  
2️⃣ This snippet covers only four cases and a few hours on March 1. It’s too small and potentially unrepresentative of the full month’s volume, case mix or process variants. Other cases might include “Manual Fraud Check” more (or less) often, or use slightly different activity labels (“Fraud Check – Manual”, “Manual Review & Fraud Check”) that won’t match the exact string. Sampling bias and label variation in the complete log could therefore lead to a substantial misestimate if one extrapolates from this tiny extract.
