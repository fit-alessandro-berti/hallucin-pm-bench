To ensure claims reach the "Triage Claim" task within 48 hours, introduce a timer event after "Receive Claim" to monitor the time. If the process exceeds the SLA, it auto-escalates. Update "Start_Claim" to a timer event, adjusting its ID to "Start_Claim_Timer" and specifying an expression for the timer (e.g., "PT48H"). If the timer fires, introduce a new exclusive gateway (ID: "GW_Escalate") to direct the process to an escalation task (e.g., auto-notify management). This keeps the process within SLA without adding new tasks, modifying existing flows, and introducing clear escalation handling.
