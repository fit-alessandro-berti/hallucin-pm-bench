Attach an interrupting boundary timer event (e.g., `Timer_48h`) to `Task_RequestDocs` with a `timeDate`/`timeDuration` set to 48 hours from `Start_Claim` (submission timestamp). Add a sequence flow from this timer directly to `Task_Triage` (bypassing the waiting for documents). This will auto‑escalate any claim still waiting for missing docs so it reaches `Task_Triage` within the SLA.
