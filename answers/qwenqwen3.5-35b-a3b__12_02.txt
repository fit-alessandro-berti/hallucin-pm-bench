The claim is inaccurate because in Case C003, Validate_Payment appears in line 6 before Receive_Order occurs in line 7, which directly contradicts the requirement that Validate_Payment must follow Receive_Order. Additionally, Case C005 line 11 shows a Validate_Payment event without any preceding Receive_Order activity in the provided log fragment. Since there are specific instances where Validate_Payment precedes or occurs without Receive_Order, the statement that it always follows the latter is false.
