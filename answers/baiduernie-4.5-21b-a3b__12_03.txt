1. No.  
2. **Justification:** Although“Validate_Payment” often follows“Receive_Order”in the majority of cases (e.g., C001, C002, C003), this is not absolute. In the case of **C004**, there are intervening activities between“Receive_Order”and“Validate_Payment.”Specifically, after“Receive_Order”(2025-01-03T10:05:00), C004 proceeds to“Check_Fraud” (2025-01-03T10:07:00) and“Validate_Payment” (2025-01-03T10:20:00), which clearly reflects a gap of 13 minutes. This deviation invalidates the claim that“Validate_Payment”always occurs immediately after“Receive_Order.”
