Attach an **Interrupting Boundary Timer Event** to `Task_RequestDocs` (ID: `Task_RequestDocs`) with a 48-hour duration. Connect the timer’s outgoing sequence flow directly to `Task_Triage` (ID: `Task_Triage`). This ensures that if document collection stalls, the process automatically bypasses the waiting state and proceeds to Triage after the deadline. While the timer activates upon task entry, it addresses the primary bottleneck where SLA breaches typically occur due to missing documentation, forcing escalation without adding new tasks. This modification uses existing flows and elements to enforce the time constraint effectively.
