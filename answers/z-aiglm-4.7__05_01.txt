Attach an **Interrupting Boundary Timer Event** to **`Task_Check`** configured for a 48-hour duration. Connect the event directly to **`Task_Triage`**.

If the manual check exceeds the time limit, the timer triggers, cancels the verification task, and forces the process flow to skip the documentation gateway and immediately proceed to Triage. This guarantees the claim reaches the required stage within the SLA.
