### Responses:

1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs exactly **1** time in this fragment.
2. Since there are 18 total logged events, the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” represents **5.56%** (0.55 rounded to two decimal places).
3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

4. Here are two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable:
   - **Limited Case Coverage:** The log fragment only includes a few cases, and assuming it represents the full month may overlook other cases and their potential patterns of manual fraud checks.
   - **Time Interval Assumptions:** It might be assumed that the log fragment is representative of the entire month, but it’s daylight so it could be influenced by specific hours or days of the week, which may not reflect the whole month's frequency accurately.
