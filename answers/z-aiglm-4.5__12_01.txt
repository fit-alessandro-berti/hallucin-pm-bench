The fact is **not accurate** with respect to the provided event-log fragment.  

### Justification:  
- **Case 1001**: The sequence is `Update_Inventory` (08:25:55) → `Authorize_Refund` (08:30:02). Here, `Authorize_Refund` occurs **after** `Update_Inventory`, not immediately before it.  
- **Case 1003**: The sequence is `Update_Inventory` (10:08:07) → `Quality_Check` → `Authorize_Refund` (10:22:18). Again, `Authorize_Refund` occurs **after** `Update_Inventory` and is not adjacent to it.  

### Key Observations:  
1. In both cases where both activities occur (1001 and 1003), `Update_Inventory` **precedes** `Authorize_Refund`, contradicting the claim.  
2. **No case** shows `Authorize_Refund` immediately before `Update_Inventory`.  

Thus, the fragment disproves the fact.
