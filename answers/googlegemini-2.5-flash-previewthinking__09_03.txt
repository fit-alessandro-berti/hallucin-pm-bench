Unfortunately, based *solely* on the artefacts provided, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity “Approve Invoice”. The cycle time for an activity instance is calculated as the difference between its complete time and start time. Artefact A, the supplied event log stub, explicitly states that *all row data and all timestamp values* have been removed for privacy. Without these specific `start_time` and `complete_time` values for each instance of the "Approve Invoice" activity, no calculation of its cycle time statistics is possible from this log data. Artefact B provides external KPI information but not event data from the supplied log.
