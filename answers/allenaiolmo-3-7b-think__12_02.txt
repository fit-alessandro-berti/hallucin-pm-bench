The fact is inaccurate. For C002 (line 3: Receive_Order), the next event is Check_Inventory (line 4), not Validate_Payment (line 5). For C003 (line 7: Receive_Order), Validate_Payment occurs earlier at line 6, violating the "follows" order. Line 6 (C003, Validate_Payment) precedes line 7 (C003, Receive_Order), directly contradicting the claim.
