# Acme Bank — Small-Business Loan-Approval Process

---

## (a) Every Decision Point

The process contains exactly **two** decision points:

| # | Decision Point | Rule (one sentence) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Step 4 — Risk / Amount Conditional Branch** | If the Tri-Color-Risk-Check yields a **Low or Medium** risk rating **and** the requested amount is **≤ €250 000**, then Step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review) is **skipped**; otherwise the application must proceed through Step 5. |
| 2 | **Step 6 — "TriVote" Decision Gate** | Three named roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) each cast an approve-or-reject vote, and the loan **passes if any two of the three approve**. |

No other conditional logic, gate, or branching criterion is defined in the process.
