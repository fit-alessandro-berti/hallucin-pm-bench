No  
**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1:** Satisfied—QE (step 3) and RA (step 5) occur once each, and in the correct order (QE before RA).  
- **Rule 2:** Satisfied—Severity is "High," and VP (step 6) occurs after both QE (step 3) and RA (step 5).  
- **Rule 3:** **Violated**—NA occurs at step 4, but RA is not complete until step 5; rule requires NA to occur *after both* QE and RA, not before RA.  
- **Rule 4:** Satisfied—CC (step 7) occurs after NA (step 4) and VP (step 6), as required for high-severity cases.  

The violation of Rule 3 makes the trace non-compliant.
