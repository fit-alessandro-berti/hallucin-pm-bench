Non-compliant.
1.  **Violation of Rule 2:** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (Event 4). According to Rule 2, this means `Risk_Assessment` must_occur_before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at Event 8 (2025-05-06 09:40), while `Risk_Assessment` occurs at Event 9 (2025-05-06 10:31). Thus, `Risk_Assessment` occurs *after* `Ship_Goods`, violating this rule.
2.  **Violation of Rule 3:** Activity `Goods_Received` occurs at Event 6. Rule 3 states that `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance â‰¤ 2). This means `Three_way_match` should have occurred at Event 7 or Event 8. However, `Three_way_match` occurs at Event 10, which is the 4th activity after `Goods_Received` (distance = 10 - 6 = 4). This violates the rule.
