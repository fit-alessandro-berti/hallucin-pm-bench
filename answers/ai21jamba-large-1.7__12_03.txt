**1. Answer: No**

**2. Justification:**

The statement is incorrect. In Cases C002 and C004, the activity **“Validate_Payment”** does not occur immediately after **“Receive_Order.”**

- **Case C002:** The sequence is:**Receive_Order (2025-01-03T09:30:00) → Pack_Items (2025-01-03T09:50:00) → Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:05:00)**
- **Case C004:** The sequence is:**Receive_Order (2025-01-03T10:05:00) → Check_Fraud (2025-01-03T10:07:00) → Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:20:00)**

In both cases, there are other activities (e.g., **Pack_Items** or **Check_Fraud**) occurring between **“Receive_Order”** and **“Validate_Payment,”** contradicting the statement.
