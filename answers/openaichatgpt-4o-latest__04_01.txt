Non-compliant

1. ❌ Rule 2 violation: Since the activity Expedite_Flag occurs (event #4), Risk_Assessment must occur before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods. However, Risk_Assessment (event #9) comes after Ship_Goods (event #8), violating Rule 2(b).

2. ✅ Rule 1 satisfied: The PO_Amount is €12 300 (> €10 000), and two approvals occur before Issue_PO — first by a Procurement_Officer (event #2), then by the CFO (event #3), before activity Issue_PO (event #5).

3. ✅ Rule 3 satisfied: Goods_Received is at event #6, and Three_way_match occurs at event #10, which is within the next four events (#7, #8, #9, #10). However, Rule 3 requires it within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2) — i.e., must occur at position #7 or #8. Therefore, this is a violation.

    Correction: ❌ Rule 3 violation: Goods_Received is at event #6. Three_way_match occurs at event #10, which is four activities later (#7, #8, #9, #10). The maximum allowed distance is two. Thus, Rule 3 is violated.

4. ✅ Rule 4 satisfied: The only activity executed by CFO is at event #3. The next event (#4) is executed by System. The Intern’s activity is at #7, which does not directly follow the CFO's.

5. ✅ Rule 5 satisfied: The trace ends with Archive_Record (event #11), and there are no events after it.

Final determination: Two rule violations (Rules 2 and 3) render the trace non-compliant.

Corrected summary:

Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 violation: Because Expedite_Flag occurs at event #4, Risk_Assessment must occur before Ship_Goods. Instead, Risk_Assessment (event #9) occurs after Ship_Goods (event #8).

2. Rule 3 violation: Three_way_match (event #10) occurs more than two activities after Goods_Received (event #6), exceeding the maximum allowed distance of 2.
