1️⃣ The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs **once** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ This snippet shows only 3 cases. One includes “Manual Fraud Check”; another uses “Manual Review” + differently named fraud step; the third uses “Fraud Check (Automatic)”. An analyst might assume manual checks are rare (1/3 cases) or conflate similar-sounding activities. Without seeing naming conventions, case volume, or full variants (e.g., “Manual Fraud Review”), they can’t reliably infer frequency. Sampling bias and inconsistent labeling in this small slice distort true prevalence in the full log.
