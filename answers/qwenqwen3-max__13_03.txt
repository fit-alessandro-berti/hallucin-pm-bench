1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in the excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ This snippet covers only three cases from a single day in March 2025. The full log likely contains thousands of cases across the entire month. Without knowing the sampling method or representativeness of this excerpt, an analyst cannot infer the true frequency of “Manual Fraud Check” in the full dataset. If this snippet is biased (e.g., selected because it includes manual checks), it may overrepresent their occurrence. Conversely, if manual checks are rare and this snippet happened to include one, the analyst might mistakenly believe they are more common than they actually are. Process-mining conclusions require statistically representative or complete data.
