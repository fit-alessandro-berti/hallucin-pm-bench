### Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process  

1. **Eligibility Determination** (during *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*)  
   - *Triggered by*: Submission of *RefundRequestForm*  
   - *Decision*: Whether the claim is **eligible** based on cross-referencing the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.  
   - *Branches*:  
     - **Eligible** → proceeds to *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*  
     - **Ineligible** → process terminates (no further steps)  

2. **High-value Threshold Check** (after *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* succeeds)  
   - *Triggered by*: Successful pre-approval  
   - *Decision*: Is the refund amount **> €1,000**?  
   - *Branches*:  
     - **Yes (high-value)** → proceed to *Senior_Auditor_Review* (requires *AuditTrail*)  
     - **No (≤ €1,000)** → skip *Senior_Auditor_Review* and proceed directly to *Process_Refund_Payment*
