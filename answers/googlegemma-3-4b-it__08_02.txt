Okay, let's analyze the Petri net PN-8 to answer your questions.

**Question 1:** Yes, it’s possible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

**Question 2 (bonus):** A minimal firing sequence demonstrating this is: M0 → T1 → {P0} → P1 → T2 → {P3} → T7 → {P4} → T3 → {P4} → T4 → {P5} → T5 → {P6}.  This sequence starts with the initial marking M0 (only P0). T1 fires, creating P1 and P2.  Then, T2 and T7 are allowed to proceed without affecting T3.  After T7, T3 is reached, and subsequently T4 and T5. T5 can fire before T3 because T3 is not blocked by any token. 


Do you want me to examine any other aspects of this Petri net or analyze a different scenario?
