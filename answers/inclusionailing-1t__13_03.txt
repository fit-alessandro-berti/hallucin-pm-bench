1️⃣ **1 time** — Only case 1002 contains the exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check".

2️⃣ This snippet shows just one occurrence, but it may over- or under-represent the true frequency due to: (a) limited time window (only March 1), (b) small sample of cases (3 total), and (c) possible variation in fraud check types based on unobserved rules (e.g., automatic vs. manual assignment). If manual checks occur mostly later in the month or on specific case types not shown here, extrapolating from this snippet would be unreliable. The log lacks context on triggering conditions and full process volume for March 2025.
