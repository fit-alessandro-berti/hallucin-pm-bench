**a) Decision Points in Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS Loan-Approval Process:**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome Determination**  
   → Assigns a risk rating (Low, Medium, High) based on the combined results of the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow scorecards.

2. **Conditional Branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check**  
   → If the risk rating is Low or Medium **and** the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, skip the Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5); otherwise, proceed to Step 5.

3. **Decision-Gate “TriVote”**  
   → Requires at least two approvals out of three from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer to pass; unanimous approval is not required.
