**No**, it is **not possible** for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

### **Proof of Impossibility:**

To fire **T5**, the following conditions must be satisfied:

- **p3 must have ≥1 token** (normal input arc),
- **p4 must have exactly 0 tokens** (inhibitor arc).

Now, let’s trace how tokens reach **p3** and **p4**:

- **p3** is only populated by **T2**, which requires **p1** to have ≥1 token.
- **p1** is only populated by **T1**, which consumes **p0**.
- So:  
  **T1 → p1, p2**  
  → then **T2 → p3**, and **T3 → p4**

Thus, **p3** can only become marked **after** T1 and then T2 fire.  
Similarly, **p4** can only become marked **after** T1 and then T3 fire.

Therefore, **T3 must fire before p4 can have any token**.

But T5 requires **p4 to have 0 tokens**. So if T3 has **not yet fired**, then p4 is still empty (0 tokens) — which satisfies the inhibitor condition.

BUT — T5 also requires **p3 to have ≥1 token**.

Can **p3 have a token before T3 fires**?

Only if T2 fires before T3.

So the question becomes: **Can T2 fire before T3?**

Yes — T2 and T3 are **independent** after T1 fires. T1 produces tokens in p1 and p2 independently, so T2 and T3 are **concurrent** and can fire in either order.

So consider this possible sequence:

1. **T1 fires**:  
   p0(1) → p1(1), p2(1)  
   Now: p1(1), p2(1), others 0.

2. **T2 fires** (uses p1 → p3):  
   p1(0), p3(1), p2(1), p4(0)

At this point:
- p3 has 1 token ✅
- p4 has 0 tokens ✅

So **T5 is now enabled!**

Wait — does this mean T5 **can** fire **before** T3?

**Yes!** In this marking:  
p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

T5 is enabled: p3≥1 and p4=0 → T5 can fire.

And T3 has **not yet fired**.

So — **T5 fires before T3**.

### ✅ **Answer: YES**

### Concrete firing sequence:

1. **T1**: p0 → p1 + p2  
   Marking: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

2. **T2**: p1 → p3  
   Marking: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

3. **T5**: p3 + (inhibitor p4=0) → p6  
   Marking: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1)

→ **T5 fired before T3** (T3 still not fired).

### ✅ Justification:
T1 enables both T2 and T3 in parallel. T2 can fire first, producing a token in p3 while p4 remains empty. Since T5 requires p3≥1 and p4=0, it becomes enabled **before** T3 fires. Thus, T5 **can** fire before T3.

**The inhibitor arc condition is satisfied if p4 is empty — which it is before T3 fires.**
T3 is not a prerequisite for T5; only the *absence* of tokens in p4 is.

### ✅ Final Answer: **YES**

**Firing sequence**:  
**T1 → T2 → T5**  
T3 has not fired yet when T5 fires.
