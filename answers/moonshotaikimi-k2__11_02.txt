MEMO — Claims Handling Q1-2025 Performance  
To: COO, Acme Insurance  

Three out-of-SLA hotspots:

1. **Request_Documents** – 150-min wait, low 190 tpd output, 22 % rework, 5.5 % SLA breach.  
   Cause is a tri-week-of-delay queue.  
   Action: Mandate next-day doc-request form dispatch via automated rules; auto-tracking will cut wait/load, hitting baseline 50 %.

2. **Review_Documents** – 25-min processing, 9-min stdev, 12.4 % SLA miss.  
   Variation + high volume.  
   Action: Pilot robotic process-automation for routine checks; goal: compress 20 % processing time.

3. **Initial_Assessment** – 18-min wait feeding the two upstream activities’ pile-up.  
   Action: Fast-track (SLA ≤ 10 min) via reallocating two Senior Adjusters during first two hours daily—targets a 3 % SLA improvement.

Effect on customer netting: > 70 min average end-to-end reduction, 5 % drop in total SLA breaches.
