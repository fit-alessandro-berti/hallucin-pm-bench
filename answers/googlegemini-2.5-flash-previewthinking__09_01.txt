Based on the data provided in the event log header, I cannot determine the average cycle time for the "Review Contract" activity.

**Explanation:**
Calculating the cycle time (duration) of an activity requires information about the start time and end time for each instance of that activity, or a specific field recording the elapsed time for the activity instance. The provided event log header explicitly states that "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted". Without these fields, it is impossible to measure how long each "Review Contract" activity instance took, and therefore impossible to calculate the average duration across all cases.
