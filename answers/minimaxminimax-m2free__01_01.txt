I need to carefully analyze the Contoso Airlines flight-refund process described and identify all decision points and required documents. Let me go through each step:

1. **Customer_Submit_Claim** — the passenger completes a *RefundRequestForm* online.
   - Decision point: None (this is just submission)
   - Required documents: RefundRequestForm

2. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** — a triage agent checks the claim against the *FlightManifest* and the *WeatherReport*.
   - Decision point: Eligibility validation (whether claim is eligible or not)
   - Required documents: FlightManifest, WeatherReport

3. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** — a finance controller signs off using an *EligibilityChecklist*.
   - Decision point: Finance approval decision
   - Required documents: EligibilityChecklist

4. **High-value branch**: if the refund amount is **greater than €1 000**, the case proceeds to **Senior_Auditor_Review**, which must include the *AuditTrail*.
   - Decision point: Whether refund amount > €1,000 (determines if high-value branch is taken)
   - Required documents: AuditTrail

5. **Process_Refund_Payment** — the finance team executes payment once the signed *BankTransferAuthorization* is present.
   - Decision point: None (execution step)
   - Required documents: BankTransferAuthorization

6. **Issue_Confirmation_Letter** — the system emails a *RefundConfirmationPDF* to the passenger.
   - Decision point: None (notification step)
   - Required documents: RefundConfirmationPDF

Let me identify all decision points:
1. Eligibility validation at step 2
2. Finance approval decision at step 3
3. High-value threshold decision (>€1,000) at step 4

Let me list all required documents mentioned:
- RefundRequestForm
- FlightManifest
- WeatherReport
- EligibilityChecklist
- AuditTrail
- BankTransferAuthorization
- RefundConfirmationPDF

## Summary of Decision Points in Contoso's Process

**1. Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**
- Decision: Whether the claim is eligible based on FlightManifest and WeatherReport validation

**2. Finance_Controller_PreApprove**
- Decision: Whether to approve the refund based on EligibilityChecklist

**3. High-Value Threshold Check**
- Decision: Whether refund amount exceeds €1,000 (determines if Senior_Auditor_Review is required)

## Required Documents

**All documents required throughout the process:**
- *RefundRequestForm* (Step 1)
- *FlightManifest* (Step 2)
- *WeatherReport* (Step 2)
- *EligibilityChecklist* (Step 3)
- *AuditTrail* (Step 4, for high-value claims)
- *BankTransferAuthorization* (Step 5)
- *RefundConfirmationPDF* (Step 6)

**Note:** Process_Refund_Payment requires both Finance_Controller_PreApprove success and (for high-value cases) completion of Senior_Auditor_Review before execution.
