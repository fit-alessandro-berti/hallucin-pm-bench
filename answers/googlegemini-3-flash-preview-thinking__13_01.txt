Based on the provided event-log fragment, here are the answers to your questions:

1.  **Count of “Manual_Fraud_Check”:** 1
2.  **Percentage of all logged events:** 5.56% (Calculation: 1 / 18 total events ≈ 0.05555...)
3.  **Case identifier(s):** A1002
4.  **Sampling-related reasons for unreliability:**
    *   **Small Sample Size:** A fragment containing only 4 cases and 18 events is statistically insufficient to capture the variance of a process; a single outlier (the one fraud check) disproportionately influences the metrics.
    *   **Temporal Bias (Time Window):** The data covers a very narrow window of only five hours on a single day (09:00 to 14:05). This fails to account for cyclical patterns, such as day-of-week trends, end-of-month surges, or seasonal fluctuations in order volume and fraud frequency.
