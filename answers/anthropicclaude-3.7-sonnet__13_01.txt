Based on the provided event log fragment, I'll answer each question:

1. Exactly how many times does the activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occur in this fragment?
   **1 time**

2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)
   There are 18 total events in the log, and "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time.
   Percentage = (1/18) Ã— 100 = 5.56%

3. List the case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check".
   **A1002**

4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable:
   
   1. The sample size is extremely small (only 4 cases and 18 events total), which is not representative of a month's worth of data.
   
   2. The time span covered by this fragment is only about 5 hours (from 09:00 to 14:05) on a single day (2025-05-01), which doesn't capture potential variations in fraud patterns that might occur across different days, weeks, or throughout a month.
