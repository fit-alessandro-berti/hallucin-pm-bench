1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.

2. There are 18 total events in the log.  
   One event is “Manual_Fraud_Check”, so the percentage is:  
   $ \frac{1}{18} \times 100 \approx 5.56\% $

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is: **A1002**

4. Two sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable:
   - **Small sample size**: The log contains only 18 events and covers a single day, which is insufficient to generalize to a monthly pattern.
   - **Lack of temporal coverage**: The data is from only one day (2025-05-01), so it may not represent variability across days, weeks, or months (e.g., weekends, peaks, or seasonal trends).
