1. Once.

2. The sample contains 2 of 3 cases needing manual steps (CaseID 1002 reviewed/checked; 1001 resent a manual Send Offer), so manual work seems frequent. The excerpt covers one morning; mid‑month backlogs or policy changes could raise or lower real frequency. If “Fraud Check (Automatic)” merges into “Automatic Fraud Check” in the full log, counts may shift. Also, “Manual Fraud Check” appears once, but some manual decisions (e.g., Manual Review) may not trigger a distinct check, making manual work appear rarer than it is.
