2.
   a) **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** accounts for **(1/48)*100 = 2.08%** of all events.
   b) Of 12 unique cases, **8.33%** involve this activity (1/12).

3. Low-support activities (e.g., **“Manual_Fraud_Check”**) represent rare deviations from the standard process (which defaults to **“Auto_Fraud_Check”**). In generalised models, they may be ignored or underrepresented, leading to skewed predictions (e.g., overestimating automated fraud detection accuracy) or missed edge cases (e.g., manual checks signaling legitimate but complex claims). Without context, analyses could misinterpret these outliers as noise, overlooking critical process variations.
