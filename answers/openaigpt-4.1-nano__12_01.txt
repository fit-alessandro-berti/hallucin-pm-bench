Based solely on the provided event-log fragment, the fact that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case is not confirmed.

- For case 1001:  
  Activities are in the order: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued.  
  Here, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund," not after.

- For case 1002:  
  Activities are: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued.  
  "Authorize_Refund" occurs before "Refund_Issued" but **not** before "Update_Inventory," which is absent in this case.

- For case 1003:  
  Activities are: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund.  
  Here, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund," not after.

Therefore, in all cases within the snippet, "Authorize_Refund" does **not** immediately precede "Update_Inventory." The statement is not supported by the data provided.
