Answer 1: Yes.

Answer 2:
A minimal firing sequence is: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Explanation:
After T1 fires, tokens appear in P1 and P2. Firing T2 then T7 and T4 moves the token from P1 to P5, while the token in P2 (from T1) remains. With tokens in P2 and P5, T5 is enabled and may fire. Firing T3 before T5 would consume the needed token in P2, so avoiding T3 ensures T5 can fire first.
