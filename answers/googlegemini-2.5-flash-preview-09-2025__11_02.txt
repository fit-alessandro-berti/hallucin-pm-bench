**TO:** COO, Acme Insurance
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review (Executive Summary)

The Claims Handling process experienced significant bottlenecks in Q1, primarily concentrated on three activities:

1.  **Request Documents:**
    *   **Underperformance:** Extremely high average wait time (150 minutes) and the highest rework rate (22.0%), indicating cases queue excessively and frequently require re-initiation.
    *   **Action:** Implement immediate validation/triage before the activity to reduce the 22.0% rework rate, thereby cutting downstream volume and wait time.

2.  **Review Documents:**
    *   **Underperformance:** Highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and the longest average processing time (25 minutes) coupled with high variability (Stdev 9 minutes).
    *   **Action:** Launch a targeted training program focusing on standardization to reduce processing time and variability (9 min std dev), directly addressing the 12.4% SLA failure.

3.  **Initial Assessment:**
    *   **Underperformance:** High average wait time (18 minutes) and the third-highest SLA breach rate (3.2%), indicating delays and capacity issues early in the main flow.
    *   **Action:** Prioritize increasing capacity for this activity to reduce the 18-minute queue time and improve the 3.2% SLA compliance.

The impact of "Request Documents" is clear due to the drop in throughput from 270 (Check Coverage) to 190.
