Here is the structured summary of Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process based on your query:

### **a) Decision Points (Gates or Conditional Branches)**

Each decision point in the process is listed below, with a concise one-sentence description of its decision rule:

1. **Risk Check → Routing Decision**  
   - *If the risk rating is Low or Medium **and** the requested amount is ≤ €250,000*, skip Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise, proceed to that step.

2. **Decision Gate – “TriVote”**  
   - Approval requires at least **two out of three** approvals from the following roles: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer.

### **b) All Required Documents (in Order of Appearance)**

Here are all the documents involved in the process, listed in the order they first appear:

1. **Form 14B** – Received at the start of the application.
2. **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** – Used as inputs for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check.
3. **Deck Memo** – Created during the Manual-Underwriting-Review step (only if triggered).
4. **Offer Sheet 77** – Used to prepare the binding offer upon approval.
5. **ID Matrix Declaration** – Required from the applicant upon confirmation of the offer.

 ▪ *Note:* The **Loan Dossier 2025** is compiled upon finalization but does not constitute a document *requested* from the applicant—it's an internal compilation.
