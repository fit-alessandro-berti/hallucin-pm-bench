Based on the provided event-log excerpt:

1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **one (1)** time (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst viewing only this snippet faces two primary risks of misestimation: **Selection Bias** and **Inconsistent Labeling**. First, the sample size is extremely small (3 cases), which is statistically insufficient to represent the full month’s distribution. Second, there is clear evidence of semantic variation or inconsistent logging; Case 1001 uses "Automatic Fraud Check," Case 1003 uses "Fraud Check (Automatic)," and Case 1002 uses "Manual Fraud Check." Without a larger dataset to confirm if manual checks are recorded under different labels or if Case 1002 is an outlier, the analyst cannot reliably differentiate between a low-frequency activity and a data quality issue involving synonymous activity names.
