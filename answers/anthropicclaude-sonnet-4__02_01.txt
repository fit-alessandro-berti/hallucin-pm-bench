I'll analyze the XES event log fragment systematically to answer each question.

First, let me organize the events by case ID and timestamp:

**Case A-9321:**
- 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00: Receive_Order
- 2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00: Validate_Order
- 2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00: Pack_Items
- 2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00: Ship_Order

**Case B-1045:**
- 2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00: Receive_Order
- 2025-04-14T08:17:00.000+00:00: Validate_Order
- 2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00: Quality_Check
- 2025-04-14T09:10:00.000+00:00: Pack_Items
- 2025-04-14T09:25:00.000+00:00: Ship_Order

**Case C-77:**
- 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00: Quality_Check

Now answering each question:

**Q1:** Counting distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77 = 3 cases

**Q2:** In case A-9321, the sequence is: Receive_Order → Validate_Order → Pack_Items → Ship_Order
So "Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order"

**Q3:** Comparing all timestamps, the earliest is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00

**Q4:** Counting "Quality_Check" occurrences: appears in case B-1045 once and case C-77 once = 2 times

**Q5:** First events of each case are:
- Case A-9321: Receive_Order
- Case B-1045: Receive_Order  
- Case C-77: Quality_Check

Activities that never appear as first events: Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Ship_Order

```json
{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Pack_Items",
  "Q3": "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00",
  "Q4": 2,
  "Q5": ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]
}
```
