1) The average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the provided log.

2) The event log excerpt lists only case IDs, activities, and resources; it lacks timestamps or elapsed durations, which are necessary to calculate activity cycle times. The historical benchmarks provided cover other activities and are from a different segment, so they cannot be used to infer “Review Contract” timings in this log.
