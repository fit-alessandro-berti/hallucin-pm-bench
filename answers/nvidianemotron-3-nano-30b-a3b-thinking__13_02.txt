Because “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs in only one of twelve cases, its support is extremely low. If models or performance metrics are trained or evaluated on this slice, they may over‑estimate the importance of manual checks, leading to biased risk scores or misguided process‑optimisation decisions. Such bias arises when a rare, case‑specific step is mistakenly treated as representative of the overall workflow, obscuring the true dynamics of the majority of claims.
