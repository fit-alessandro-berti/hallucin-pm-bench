**No.**

Justification referencing each rule:

- **Rule 1 (Violated):** The activities occur in order Quality_Engineer_Review (**QE**) → Notify_Authorities (**NA**) → Regulatory_Affairs_Review (**RA**). RA must occur immediately after QE, before NA. Here, NA occurs between QE and RA, violating Rule 1.
- **Rule 2 (Satisfied):** VP_Safety_Approval (**VP**) occurs after both QE and RA, satisfying Rule 2.
- **Rule 3 (Violated):** NA occurred before the RA was completed. QE and RA must both finish before NA occurs. This is clearly violated.
- **Rule 4 (Satisfied):** Close_Case (**CC**) occurs after NA and VP, satisfying Rule 4.

Since rules 1 and 3 are violated, the trace overall is **not compliant**.
