# Concurrent Task Sets in Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment

**Set 1** (Parallel Split #1 → Merge #1):
- **Quality_Check**
- **Update_Inventory**

**Set 2** (Parallel Split #2 → Merge #2):
- **Generate_Replenishment_Report**
- **Notify_Procurement**

---

**Summary:** Process B contains exactly **two** parallel gateways. In each case, the two listed tasks sit on separate branches of the same parallel construct and may therefore execute concurrently. The second parallel construct only begins after **Store_Items** completes (which itself follows the merge of the first parallel construct), so the two sets are sequential relative to each other.
