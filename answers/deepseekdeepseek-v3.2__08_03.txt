Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking. This is because T5 requires tokens in both pd and pe, and pd can be obtained directly from T2b without requiring T3 to fire. Similarly, pe can be obtained from T4 using the token from pb generated by T1.

One shortest firing sequence (length 4) where T5 fires before T3 is:
- T1 (consumes p0, produces pa and pb)
- T2b (consumes pa, produces pd)
- T4 (consumes pb, produces pe)
- T5 (consumes pd and pe, produces pf)

In this sequence, T3 never fires, so T5 fires without T3 having fired previously. Alternatively, the sequence T1, T4, T2b, T5 is also valid and of the same length.
