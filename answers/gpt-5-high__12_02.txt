No. In case C003, Validate_Payment happens before Receive_Order (line 6 precedes line 7), so it does not follow it, and in case C005, Validate_Payment occurs (line 11) with no Receive_Order in that case at all (line 12 is Cancel_Order). Although cases C001 (lines 1–2), C002 (lines 3,5), and C004 (lines 8–9) show Validate_Payment after Receive_Order, the “always follows” claim is violated by C003 and C005.
