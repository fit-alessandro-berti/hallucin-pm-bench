To enforce the 48-hour SLA without adding new tasks, add a **boundary timer event** to Task_Receive (ID: Task_Receive) with a duration of **PT48H** (48 hours). If the task isnâ€™t completed within this time, the timer triggers an **escalation flow** by connecting to Task_Triage (ID: Task_Triage), bypassing Task_Check and GW_Docs. This ensures the claim reaches triage on time even if earlier steps are delayed. Use an **intermediate event-based sequence flow** from the timer to Task_Triage without altering existing tasks or logic.
