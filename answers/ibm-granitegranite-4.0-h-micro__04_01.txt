Non-compliant

Justification:
1. Rule 1 requires any PO exceeding â‚¬10,000 to obtain approvals from a Procurement Officer and then the CFO before `Issue_PO`. Trace 24-EXP meets this requirement (Activities 2 and 3).
2. Rule 4 prohibits an Intern from directly following a CFO. In Trace 24-EXP, Activity 7 (Move_to_Quality) is directly executed by an Intern immediately after Activity 3 (Approve_PO_CFO) executed by the CFO. This violates Rule 4.
3. All other rules are satisfied: 
   - Rule 5 is satisfied as the trace ends with `Archive_Record` and no activities follow it.
   - Rule 3 is satisfied as `Three_way_match` (Activity 10) occurs within two activities after `Goods_Received` (Activity 6).
   - Rule 2 is satisfied as `Expedite_Flag` is present, and `Risk_Assessment` (Activity 9) occurs before `Ship_Goods` (Activity 8).
