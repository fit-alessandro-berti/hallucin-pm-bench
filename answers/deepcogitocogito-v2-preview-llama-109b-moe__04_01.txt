Okay, let's go through this step by step. The trace ID 24-EXP needs to be checked against the process rules P2P-2025.R1. 

First, the PO amount is €12,300, which is above the €10,000 threshold. According to rule 1, such a PO must get two approvals before Issue_PO. Looking at the trace, activities 2 and 3 are both Approve_PO, first by Procurement_Officer and then by CFO. Then activity 5 is Issue_PO. So that seems compliant with rule 1.

Next, there's an Expedite_Flag in activity 4. According to rule 2, when Expedite_Flag is present, Quality_Check becomes optional but Risk_Assessment must occur before Ship_Goods. In the trace, after Expedite_Flag at #4, there's no Quality_Check activity. Then Ship_Goods happens at #8. The Risk_Assessment at #9 is after Ship_Goods. Since the Risk_Assessment needs to be before Ship_Goods, this seems non-compliant. Wait, but maybe I misread. Let me check again. Activity 9 is Risk_Assessment, which is after Ship_Goods at #8. So that's a problem. According to rule 2, Risk_Assessment must occur before Ship_Goods. So this is non-compliant.

Moving on to rule 3: After Goods_Received, Three_way_match must be completed within the next two activities. Goods_Received is at #6. The next activity is #7 (Move_to_Quality by Intern) and then #8 (Ship_Goods). Three_way_match is at #10. The distance from #6 to #10 is 4 activities, which is more than 2. So that's non-compliant with rule 3.

Rule 4 says no activity by Intern can directly follow one by CFO. Looking at the trace, after CFO's Approve_PO_CFO at #3, the next activity is Expedite_Flag by System at #4. There's no activity by Intern directly after CFO, but later there's Move_to_Quality by Intern at #7, which is after #6 by Warehouse_Clerk. So rule 4 seems okay.

Rule 5 requires the trace to end with Archive_Record, which it does at #11. No activities after that, so that's compliant.

So the violations are rule 2 (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods) and rule 3 (Three_way_match too far after Goods_Received). Therefore, the trace is non-compliant.
Non-compliant

Justifications:
1. Rule **2**: In the presence of `Expedite_Flag`, `Risk_Assessment` must occur before `Ship_Goods`. However, `Risk_Assessment` (#9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` (#8), violating this requirement.

2. Rule **3**: After `Goods_Received` (#6), `Three_way_match` (#10) does not occur within the next two activities. Instead, it occurs four activities later, exceeding the required distance of ≤ 2.

The trace satisfies rules **1** (two approvals before Issue_PO), **4** (no Intern activities following CFO activities), and **5** (ends with Archive_Record), but fails rules **2** and **3**, making it non-compliant overall.
