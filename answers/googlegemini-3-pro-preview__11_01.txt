**RE:** Top 3 Bottlenecks by Waiting Time

Per your request, here are the three worst-performing activities ranked by average waiting time, along with performance metrics and corrective actions.

**1. Request_Documents (Worst)**
*   **Avg:** 36.5h | **95p:** 120.0h
*   **Action:** Implement specific robotic process automation (RPA) to trigger document requests immediately upon screening completion, eliminating manual dispatcher queuing.

**2. Send_Closure_Letter**
*   **Avg:** 12.2h | **95p:** 44.0h
*   **Action:** Transition from widely spaced batch processing (e.g., daily/overnight) to real-time, event-driven letter generation immediately following claim resolution.

**3. Assess_Liability**
*   **Avg:** 7.8h | **95p:** 16.4h
*   **Action:** Deploy "push" routing algorithms that auto-assign cases to the next available specialist, preventing cases from aging in shared pools due to adjuster cherry-picking.
