# Changes in Acme Bank's Loan Process

## Added tasks
- "Verify Identity" (Task_VerifyIdentity)
- "Request Additional Documents" (Task_RequestDocs)
- "Final Reject" (Task_FinalReject)

## Removed tasks
- "Reject Loan" (Task_RejectLoan)

## Gateway-type changes
- Gateway_Decision: Changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway

The process flow has been significantly modified, with the gateway now supporting three potential outcomes instead of two in the original version. While the "Approve Loan" task was renamed to "Auto-Approve Loan," this has been treated as a cosmetic change per instructions.
