One improvement to bring the process into SLA is to add a timer event to track the 48-hour SLA for reaching "Triage Claim." Connect this timer event to the "Task_Triage" using a sequence flow (e.g., add a sequence flow from the timer event to "Task_Triage" with an appropriate condition). This will ensure that if the 48-hour SLA is not met, the claim is auto-escalated without adding any new tasks. (e.g., add a timer event after "Start_Claim" with a time duration of 48 hours, and connect it to "Task_Triage" with a new sequence flow)
