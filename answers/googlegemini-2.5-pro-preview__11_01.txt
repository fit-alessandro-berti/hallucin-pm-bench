**Subject**: Urgent: Addressing Key Process Bottlenecks â€“ Waiting Times

Analysis of recent process performance data reveals critical waiting times impacting efficiency. The three worst-performing activities, ranked by average waiting time, are:

1.  **Request_Documents**: Avg wait 36.5h, 95p wait 120.0h.
    *   **Action**: Prioritize processing by allocating dedicated daily staff hours to this queue, aiming to initiate all document requests within one business day (8 hours).
2.  **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg wait 12.2h, 95p wait 44.0h.
    *   **Action**: Fully automate 'Send_Closure_Letter', integrating with claim finalization systems for immediate, no-wait dispatch post-approval/rejection.
3.  **Assess_Liability**: Avg wait 7.8h, 95p wait 16.4h.
    *   **Action**: Implement assessor workload balancing, using a real-time dashboard of individual queues, to maintain an average 'Assess_Liability' wait time below 6 hours.

These targeted actions are projected to cut respective waiting times by over 20%.
