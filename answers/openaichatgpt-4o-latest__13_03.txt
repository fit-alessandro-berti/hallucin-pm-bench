1️⃣ The activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in this event-log excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst reviewing this brief excerpt sees “Manual Fraud Check” in only one of three cases (Case 1002), potentially leading them to overestimate or underestimate its overall frequency. With such a small sample, the distribution may not reflect the full monthly log. For example, higher volumes later in the month could significantly shift the ratio of manual versus automatic checks. Therefore, conclusions drawn from this snippet may not generalize to the complete event log without further data.
