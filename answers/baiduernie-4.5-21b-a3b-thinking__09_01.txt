The requested average cycle time for the activity **"Review Contract"** cannot be derived from the provided log. 
**Reason:**  
The event log contains only **activity names and case identifiers** but lacks **timestamps or elapsed-time data** necessary to calculate the duration of any activity. Cycle time requires tracking the time between consecutive activities or the duration of an activity itself, which is not present in the data. The historical benchmarks (e.g., durations for other activities) are from a different segment and do not include "Review Contract" durations. Without temporal information, no calculation of cycle time is possible.
