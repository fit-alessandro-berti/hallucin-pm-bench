## Step 5: Determine sampling-related reasons for unreliable estimation of manual fraud checks
Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable:
1. **Limited sample size**: The data only includes a small number of cases (4 cases) observed over a single day, which may not be representative of the entire month or the process's variability.
2. **Lack of temporal representation**: The log fragment only covers a single day, which might not capture daily, weekly, or monthly patterns, seasonality, or trends in manual fraud checks.

The final answer is: 
1. 1 
2. 5.56 
3. A1002 
4. Limited sample size, Lack of temporal representation
