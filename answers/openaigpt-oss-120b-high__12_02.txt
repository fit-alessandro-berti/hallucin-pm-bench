No. In case C003 the Validate_Payment event (line 6) occurs **before** the Receive_Order event (line 7), violating the claim. Moreover, in case C005 there is a Validate_Payment event (line 11) but no preceding Receive_Order at all, so it does not follow Receive_Order. Consequently, the statement that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order is not true for the given log fragment.
