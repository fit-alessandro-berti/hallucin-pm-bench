**MEMORANDUM**  
**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Correction  

The Q1 dashboard clearly distinguishes three critical bottlenecks requiring immediate intervention:

1. **Request_Documents**  
   *Why it under-performs:* It suffers an extreme 150-minute average wait time and a massive 22.0% rework rate, causing major upstream delays.  
   *Action:* Deploy a smart customer portal that automatically validates mandatory files prior to submission to prevent incomplete data and eliminate rework loops.

2. **Review_Documents**  
   *Why it under-performs:* It drives the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), directly caused by the longest and most variable processing time (average 25 minutes, with a high 9-minute standard deviation).  
   *Action:* Implement AI-assisted data extraction (e.g., OCR) to pre-populate document details, reducing manual review dependency and standardising processing time.

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   *Why it under-performs:* It shows the third-highest wait time (18 minutes) and a 3.2% SLA breach rate, indicating a resource capacity shortage early in the pipeline.  
   *Action:* Reallocate staff from well-performing, low-wait downstream activities (like *Check_Coverage*, which has only a 4-minute wait) to clear this intake queue.
