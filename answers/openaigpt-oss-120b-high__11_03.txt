**Subject:** Priority Activities Requiring Immediate Improvement  

Our analysis of the end‑to‑end loan‑origination flow highlights three activities that jointly suffer the greatest SLA breaches and the longest average waiting periods:  

* **Legal Approval** – Avg. throughput = 900 s, SLA = 600 s → **+300 s** over target; Avg. waiting = 600 s.  
* **Risk Review** – Avg. throughput = 600 s, SLA = 300 s → **+300 s** over target; Avg. waiting = 480 s.  
* **Credit Assessment** – Avg. throughput = 300 s, SLA = 240 s → **+60 s** over target; Avg. waiting = 200 s.  

**Recommended actions**  
- Implement an automated legal‑document validation engine for Legal Approval to truncate review cycles and aim for a 200‑second reduction in throughput time.  
- Introduce a rule‑based risk‑scoring model for Risk Review that pre‑prioritizes low‑risk cases, targeting a 200‑second cut in average waiting time.  
- Deploy a credit‑scoring automation platform for Credit Assessment to streamline data gathering, seeking a 30‑second improvement in throughput and a 100‑second reduction in waiting.  

These data‑driven interventions address the most significant delays and SLA violations, directly enhancing overall process performance.
