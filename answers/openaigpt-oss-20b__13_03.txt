**1️⃣ Count of “Manual Fraud Check” in the excerpt:** 1 time (Case 1002 at 09:07:13 UTC).  

**2️⃣ Why the snippet could lead to a mis‑estimate (≤ 120 words):**  
The log fragment contains only three cases from a single day, offering an extremely small sample of the month’s activity. An analyst might assume that one manual check out of three applications reflects the overall ratio, ignoring that many other days could have more or fewer checks. Moreover, the snippet shows only the exact string “Manual Fraud Check”; other records might use different wording (e.g., “Manual Review of Fraud”), or the log may include multiple manual checks per case, all of which would be invisible in this limited excerpt. Consequently, the analyst could significantly over‑ or under‑estimate the true prevalence of manual fraud checks in the full 30‑day log.
