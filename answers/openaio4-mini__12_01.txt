The claim is not accurate.  
– Case 1001: “Update_Inventory” (08:25:55) occurs before “Authorize_Refund” (08:30:02), not after it.  
– Case 1002: “Update_Inventory” does not occur at all, yet “Authorize_Refund” does.  
– Case 1003: “Update_Inventory” (10:08:07) precedes “Authorize_Refund” (10:22:18), with “Quality_Check” in between.
