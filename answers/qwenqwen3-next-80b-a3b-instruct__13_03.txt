1️⃣ The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs **once** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate prevalence because the snippet includes only three cases, one of which contains a manual fraud check—suggesting ~33% frequency. However, this is a tiny, non-representative sample. The full log may contain thousands of cases where automatic checks dominate, or manual checks are clustered in specific subpopulations (e.g., high-risk applicants). Without full-data distribution, sampling bias could severely distort perceived frequency.
