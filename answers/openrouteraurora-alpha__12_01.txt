No. In the fragment the ordering is opposite or absent:

- **Case 1001:** `Update_Inventory` → **`Authorize_Refund`** (Authorize_Refund follows Update_Inventory, not before it).  
- **Case 1002:** `Authorize_Refund` occurs, but there is **no `Update_Inventory`** event in this case at all.  
- **Case 1003:** `Update_Inventory` → `Quality_Check` → **`Authorize_Refund`** (again Authorize_Refund follows Update_Inventory and is not immediate).  

Thus the statement “Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory within the same case” is not supported by the data.
