Answer: It is indeed possible for T5 to fire before T3. One valid shortest firing sequence is:

T1  →  T2b  →  T4  →  T5

Explanation (step by step):

• Initial marking: p0=1 and all other places = 0.
• Fire T1:  
  - Consumes the token in p0.  
  - Produces one token in pa and one token in pb.  
  - New marking: pa=1, pb=1 (all others 0).  
• Fire T2b:  
  - Consumes the token in pa.  
  - Produces one token in pd.  
  - New marking: pb=1, pd=1.  
• Fire T4:  
  - Consumes the token in pb.  
  - Produces one token in pe.  
  - New marking: pd=1, pe=1.  
• Now T5 is enabled (it needs pd=1 and pe=1). Fire T5:  
  - Consumes pd=1 and pe=1.  
  - Produces pf=1.  
  - New marking: pf=1 (and pd=0, pe=0).  

At this point T5 has fired, and T3 (which requires a token in pc) has not fired at all. Thus, the net shows that T5 can occur before T3.
