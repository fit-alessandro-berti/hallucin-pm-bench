Let's analyze the XES event log fragment.

---

### **Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

Look at the `case` attribute values:

- C001  
- C002  
- C001  
- C003  
- C002  
- C003  
- C001  
- C002  
- C003  
- C002  

Unique case IDs: **C001, C002, C003**

✅ **Answer Q1: 3**

### **Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in order (use “→”)**

Extract events for **C002**, sorted by timestamp:

Line 2: `Receive_Order` — 2025-03-01T09:15:10  
Line 5: `Check_Stock` — 2025-03-01T09:22:55  
Line 8: `Arrange_Delivery` — 2025-03-01T10:15:20  
Line 10: `Ship_Order` — 2025-03-01T10:25:40  

✅ **Answer Q2:**  
`Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`

---

### **Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (alphabetically ordered)**

We need to find, for each occurrence of `Ship_Order`, what activity came *immediately before* it **in the same case**, then collect the *distinct* such predecessors.

Let’s inspect each case:

#### **Case C001:**
Events (by timestamp):
1. `Receive_Order` — 09:12:00  
2. `Check_Stock` — 09:20:05  
3. `Ship_Order` — 10:05:10  

→ Predecessor of `Ship_Order` is **Check_Stock**

#### **Case C002:**
Events:
1. `Receive_Order` — 09:15:10  
2. `Check_Stock` — 09:22:55  
3. `Arrange_Delivery` — 10:15:20  
4. `Ship_Order` — 10:25:40  

→ Predecessor = **Arrange_Delivery**

#### **Case C003:**
Events:
1. `Receive_Order` — 09:21:30  
2. `Check_Stock` — 09:25:05  
3. `Ship_Order` — 10:20:30  

→ Predecessor = **Check_Stock**

So all immediate predecessors of `Ship_Order` across cases:
- From C001: `Check_Stock`
- From C002: `Arrange_Delivery`
- From C003: `Check_Stock` (duplicate)

Distinct predecessors:  
**Arrange_Delivery**, **Check_Stock**

Now sort **alphabetically**:

- `Arrange_Delivery`  
- `Check_Stock`

✅ **Answer Q3:**  
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```

### ✅ Final Answers:

**Q1:** `3`  
**Q2:** `Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`  
**Q3:**  
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
