 In this Petri net, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. This is because the enabling condition for T5 is that place p4 contains zero tokens, while the enabling condition for T3 is that place p2 contains a token. Since transition T3 fires before T5 in any firing sequence (as T3 is a direct successor of T1, which is the only transition that can put a token in place p2), it ensures that place p2 will always have at least one token before T5 can be enabled. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3.

Here's a brief justification:

1. The initial marking has one token in place p0.
2. To enable transition T1, place p0 must contain one token, and both places p1 and p2 must be empty. Since the net is safe, only one token can move from p0 to p1 and p2 simultaneously.
3. After firing T1, places p1 and p2 each contain one token, and place p0 is empty.
4. Transition T3 can now fire, moving a token from place p2 to place p4.
5. At this point, place p4 contains one token, and place p2 is empty.
6. Transition T5 cannot fire because its enabling condition (place p4 containing zero tokens) is not met.
7. No other transition can fire at this marking, as they all have either inhibitor arcs or require places with no tokens.

Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any firing sequence from the initial marking.
