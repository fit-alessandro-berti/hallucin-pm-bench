### Summary and Answer

The answer is **yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. One such shortest firing sequence is:

\[
\boxed{T1, T2b, T4, T5}
\]

In this sequence:
1. T1 is fired first, which moves the token from p0 to pa and pb.
2. T2b is fired, using the token from pa to put a token in pd (skipping pc and T3).
3. T4 is fired, using the token from pb to put a token in pe.
4. Now, both pd and pe have tokens, so T5 can fire, which it does, producing a token in pf.

At this point, T3 has not fired in this execution (and in fact cannot fire in the future from this marking because pc has no tokens). Therefore, T5 has fired before T3 in this firing sequence.

If a sequence where both T5 and T3 fire is required, with T5 firing first, the shortest such sequence is longer (e.g., T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3). However, the sequence above is sufficient to demonstrate that T5 can fire before T3, as T3 has not fired by the time T5 does.

Thus, the answer is yes, and one shortest firing sequence is:

\[
\boxed{T1, T2b, T4, T5}
\]
