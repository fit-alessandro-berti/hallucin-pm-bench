**Q1.** Yes. **T5** can fire without **T3** having fired.

**Q2 (bonus).** After **T1**, a token is in **P2** and another in **P1**. You can move the **P1**-token along **T2 → T7** to create a token in **P4**, then fire **T4** to put a token in **P5**. Since **P2** still holds its token (it wasn’t consumed by **T3**), **T5** becomes enabled and can fire.

A minimal firing sequence: **[T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]**.
