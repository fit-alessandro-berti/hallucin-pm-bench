No, it is **not possible** for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

### Short proof of impossibility

From the initial marking M₀ = (p0:1, others:0):

1. The only enabled transition is **T1**. After T1 fires → M₁ = (p1:1, p2:1, others:0).  
   Now both T2 and T3 are enabled, but T5 is **not** enabled because p3 has 0 tokens.

2. To enable T5 we need p3 ≥ 1 **and** p4 = 0.  
   The only way to put a token into p3 is to fire **T2** (p1 → p3).  
   So T2 must fire **before** T5 can ever become enabled.

3. From M₁ we have two possible next steps:  
   - Fire T2 first → (p2:1, p3:1, p4:0) → now T5 is enabled (and T3 still enabled).  
   - Fire T3 first → (p1:1, p2:0, p4:1) → now T5 is **disabled** forever in this branch because p4 = 1 and nothing ever removes the token from p4.

In the only case where T5 can ever fire (the first branch), **T2 has already fired** before T5 becomes enabled, and T3 has **not** fired yet.  
Therefore, whenever T5 fires, T3 has **not** fired before it — i.e., T5 always fires **before** T3 when it fires at all.  
The opposite order (T5 before T3) is impossible because T5 cannot become enabled until **after** T2 has fired, and T2 and T3 are mutually exclusive choices from the same marking.

Thus, in no reachable marking can T5 fire before T3.
