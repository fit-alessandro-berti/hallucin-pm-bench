**Re:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance  

Three activities critically degrade process flow based on Q1 data:  

1. **Request_Documents:** 150-minute average wait time and 22.0% rework rate indicate severe intake friction. Throughput drops from 270 to 190 cases/day here.  
   *Action:* Implement automated document collection to reduce manual follow-ups.  
2. **Review_Documents:** Highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and high processing variability (9 min stdev) suggest inconsistent execution.  
   *Action:* Standardize review checklists to reduce processing time variance.  
3. **Initial_Assessment:** Second-highest SLA breach (3.2%) and wait time (18 min) signal early capacity constraints compared to other activities.  
   *Action:* Adjust staffing schedules to match peak intake volumes.  

Resolving these bottlenecks targets recovery of throughput from 179 to 270+ cases/day.
