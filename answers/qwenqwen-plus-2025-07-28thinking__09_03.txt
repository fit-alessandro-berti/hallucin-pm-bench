I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity. The event log (Artefact A) is entirely redacted—all rows and timestamp values (including start_time and complete_time) are removed—leaving only column headers. Without actual timestamp data for the "Approve Invoice" activity instances, it is impossible to derive durations, averages, or statistical measures. Artefact B provides only high-level SLAs and historical process-stage durations (e.g., time between "Approve Invoice" and "Pay Invoice"), which do not contain the granular activity-level timestamps required to calculate the cycle time of "Approve Invoice" itself. No computational approximation is possible given the legally restricted, non-existent data.
