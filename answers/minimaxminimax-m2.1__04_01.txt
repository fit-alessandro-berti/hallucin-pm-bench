Non-compliant

Justification:
1. **Rule 2 Violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity 4). According to Rule 2, `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at activity 8, and `Risk_Assessment` occurs at activity 9 (after `Ship_Goods`), violating this requirement.
2. **Rule 3 Violation**: After `Goods_Received` (activity 6), `Three_way_match` must occur **within the next two activities** (distance ≤ 2). The trace shows `Three_way_match` at activity 10, resulting in a distance of 4 (10 - 6 = 4), which exceeds the allowed distance of 2.
