Let's analyze the Petri net step by step:

1. **Understanding the net structure:**
   - Places: p0 to pf
   - Transitions: T1 to T6
   - Initial mark: p0 = 1, others = 0
   - Paths:
     - T1 → T2 → T3 → T6
     - T2 → T4 (immediately)
     - T2b → T5
     - T3 → T5
   - Synchronizing join: T5 → T6

2. **Following possible paths:**
   - **First path:** T1 → T2 → T3 → T6
     - From T3 to T5: T3 → T5
   - **Second path:** T2 → T4
     - Must branch to reach T5
     - Can go either T2b → T5, then T2 → T4, or T2 → T4 directly

3. **Comparing possible sequences:**
   - In both sequences, T3 → T5 comes before T5 in the timeline
   - This sequence is always present in any valid path

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The transition T5 never fires before T3; it always occurs between T3 and T6
   - Therefore, the answer is: No, it is **not possible** for T5 to fire before T3

Final answer:
No, it is **not possible** for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking. The analysis shows that in every valid firing sequence, T3 → T5 must occur before T5, making it impossible for T5 to fire before T3.
