1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the commonness of manual fraud checks because the excerpt shows a mix of "Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)", and "Manual Fraud Check". The presence of multiple fraud check variations, with only one manual instance in this small sample, could lead to an underestimation if the full log contains more instances of *any* manual fraud check activity, or if there are other strings representing similar manual checks not shown here. The limited data prevents understanding the true ratio or prevalence of different fraud check types across all cases in the month-long log.
