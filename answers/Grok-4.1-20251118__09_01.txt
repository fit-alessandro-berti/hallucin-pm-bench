1) The requested value **cannot be derived**.

2) The event log provided contains only the sequence of activities and resources for each case, but **all timestamp-related fields and elapsed-time fields have been explicitly redacted**. Calculating the average cycle time (duration) of the activity “Review Contract” (or any other activity) requires the start and end timestamps (or at least the duration) of each occurrence of that activity. Since no timing information is present in the log, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time for “Review Contract” across the cases shown.

(Note: The historical benchmark durations given for other activities are explicitly stated to come from FY-2023 and a different customer segment, and therefore cannot be used here.)
