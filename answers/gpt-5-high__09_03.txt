I cannot compute the average cycle time of “Approve Invoice,” nor its standard deviation or a 95% confidence interval, because Artefact A contains only column headers and no events: all rows and all timestamps are redacted, leaving no start_time/complete_time pairs to derive activity durations or any sample size. The SLA excerpt in Artefact B gives a lead time from Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice (≈7.8 days) and a payment-after-receipt SLA, neither of which provides the execution duration of the “Approve Invoice” activity or its variance. Therefore, no exact metrics can be calculated from the supplied artefacts.
