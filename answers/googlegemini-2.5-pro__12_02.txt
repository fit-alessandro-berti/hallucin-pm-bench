No

The stated fact is not accurate because there are multiple counterexamples in the log fragment. In case C003, the activity *Validate_Payment* (line 6) occurs at 10:43, which is before the *Receive_Order* activity (line 7) at 10:45, directly contradicting the claim that payment validation always follows order receipt. Furthermore, in case C005, *Validate_Payment* occurs (line 11) without being preceded by a *Receive_Order* event at all.
