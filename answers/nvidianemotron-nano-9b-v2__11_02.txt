**Subject: Q1 2025 Claims Handling Performance: Key Underperformers and Recommendations**  

The Q1 2025 Claims Handling dashboard highlights three critical underperforming activities: **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.  

**Request_Documents** underperforms with the lowest throughput (190 cases/day), highest wait time (150 minutes), and highest rework rate (22%). This suggests inefficiencies in document collection or verification processes, leading to delays and repeated work.  

**Review_Documents** has a high wait time (30 minutes), long processing time (25 minutes), and a significant SLA breach rate (12.4%). The variability in processing time (9 minutes) may indicate inconsistent handling or resource allocation.  

**Initial_Assessment** shows a long wait time (18 minutes) and processing time (12 minutes), contributing to a 3.2% SLA breach. Its high rework rate (1.8%) further compounds delays.  

**Recommendations**:  
1. **Request_Documents**: Streamline the document request process via automation or clearer instructions to reduce wait time and rework.  
2. **Review_Documents**: Implement standardized templates or tools to cut processing time and variability.  
3. **Initial_Assessment**: Optimize resource allocation or simplify the assessment criteria to reduce wait and processing times.  

These actions target the root causes identified in the data, aiming to improve throughput and SLA compliance.
