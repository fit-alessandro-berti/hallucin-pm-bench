Based on the artefacts provided, it is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice."

The reason for this is explicitly stated in Artefact A (Event-Log Stub): "Every row and every timestamp value has been removed for privacy." This means that despite knowing the *column names* that *would* be present, no actual data points, specifically the `start_time` and `complete_time` values required to calculate the cycle time for any instance of the "Approve Invoice" activity, are available. Artefact B provides historical aggregate information for a different interval ("Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice") but does not contain the raw data necessary to calculate the internal cycle time of "Approve Invoice" itself or to derive new statistical measures like standard deviation or a confidence interval.
