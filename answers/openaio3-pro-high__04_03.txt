No.  
• Rule 1: QE (3) appears once and before RA (5) – satisfied.  
• Rule 2: Severity is High and VP (6) occurs after both QE and RA – satisfied.  
• Rule 3: NA (4) must wait until both QE and RA are complete, but it occurs before RA – violated.  
• Rule 4: CC (7) happens after NA and VP – satisfied.  
Because Rule 3 is violated, the trace is not compliant.
