**Executive Memo: Process Performance Review**  
To: COO, Orion Credit  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Date: [Insert Date]  

The three worst-performing activities, based on joint SLA breaches and elevated waiting times, are:  
1. **Risk Review**: Exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (600s actual vs. 300s target) with 480s average waiting time.  
2. **Legal Approval**: Exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (900s actual vs. 600s target) with 600s average waiting time.  
3. **Credit Assessment**: Exceeds SLA by 60 seconds (300s actual vs. 240s target) with 200s average waiting time.  

Recommendations:  
- **Risk Review**: Implement parallel processing for high-volume cases by cross-training two analysts per zone to reduce queue buildup.  
- **Legal Approval**: Automate initial document checks using NLP tools to cut waiting time, prioritizing cases with pending approvals exceeding 48 hours.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Introduce pre-screening rules to flag simple applications for expedited review, directing 30% of cases to junior analysts.  

Data indicates these actions directly address operational bottlenecks without altering target SLAs.
