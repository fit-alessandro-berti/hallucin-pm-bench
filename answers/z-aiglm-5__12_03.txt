**No**

**Justification:**
The FACT is inaccurate based on the event log. While the sequence holds true for Case C001 and Case C003, there are two counterexamples where other activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":

1.  **Case C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` (09:30:00) $\rightarrow$ `Pack_Items` (09:50:00) $\rightarrow$ `Validate_Payment` (10:05:00). The activity "Pack_Items" occurs between the two stated activities.
2.  **Case C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` (10:05:00) $\rightarrow$ `Check_Fraud` (10:07:00) $\rightarrow$ `Validate_Payment` (10:20:00). The activity "Check_Fraud" occurs between the two stated activities.
