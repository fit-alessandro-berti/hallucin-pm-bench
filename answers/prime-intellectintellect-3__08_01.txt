### Answer
**Yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. Below is a concrete firing sequence from the initial marking that demonstrates this, followed by a brief justification.

#### Firing Sequence:
1. **Fire T1**:  
   - **Input**: Token in `p0` (initial marking).  
   - **Output**: Tokens added to `p1` and `p2`.  
   - **Resulting Marking**: `p1=1`, `p2=1` (all other places: `p0=p3=p4=p5=p6=0`).  

2. **Fire T2**:  
   - **Input**: Token in `p1`.  
   - **Output**: Token moved from `p1` to `p3`.  
   - **Resulting Marking**: `p2=1`, `p3=1` (all other places: `p0=p1=p4=p5=p6=0`).  

3. **Fire T5**:  
   - **Input**: Token in `p3` (via normal arc) and **no token in `p4`** (via inhibitor arc).  
   - **Output**: Token moved from `p3` to `p6`.  
   - **Resulting Marking**: `p2=1`, `p6=1` (all other places: `p0=p1=p3=p4=p5=0`).  

At this point, **T3 has not fired** (token in `p2` remains, but T3 was never executed).  

#### Justification:
- After firing **T1** and **T2**, the marking has tokens in `p2` and `p3` (`p4=0`).  
- **T5 is enabled** at this marking because:  
  - It has a normal arc from `p3` (which contains 1 token).  
  - It has an inhibitor arc from `p4` (which contains 0 tokens).  
- **T3 has not fired** at any point in this sequence, as its input place `p2` still holds a token.  

Thus, T5 fires **before** T3 in this sequence.  

#### Additional Notes:
- This sequence is valid and reachable from the initial marking.  
- The Petri net remains safe (no place exceeds its capacity) throughout.  
- Other sequences (e.g., firing T3 before T2) may prevent T5 from firing, but the question only asks if it is **possible** for T5 to fire before T3, which this sequence confirms.
