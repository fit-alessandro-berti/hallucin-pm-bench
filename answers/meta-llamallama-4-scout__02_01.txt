## Step 1: Determine the distinct case IDs in the fragment.
To find the distinct case IDs, we will go through each event and list the unique case IDs. The case IDs are A-9321, B-1045, and C-77.

## 2: Identify the activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case A-9321.
For case A-9321, the events are:
- Receive_Order
- Validate_Order
- Pack_Items
- Ship_Order
So, the activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items".

## 3: Find the earliest timestamp in the fragment.
The timestamps are:
- 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T08:17:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T09:10:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T09:25:00.000+00:00
- 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00
The earliest timestamp is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00.

## 4: Count how many times the activity "Quality_Check" occurs.
The activity "Quality_Check" occurs for case B-1045 and case C-77, which makes 2 occurrences.

## 5: List every activity that never appears as the first event of any case.
The first events of cases are:
- Case A-9321: Receive_Order
- Case B-1045: Receive_Order
- Case C-77: Quality_Check
Activities that never appear as the first event are Validate_Order, Pack_Items, and Ship_Order.

## 6: Compile the answers into the required JSON schema.
Now, let's compile the answers:
- Q1: There are 3 distinct case IDs.
- Q2: The activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case A-9321 is "Pack_Items".
- Q3: The earliest timestamp is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00.
- Q4: The activity "Quality_Check" occurs 2 times.
- Q5: The activities that never appear as the first event of any case are Validate_Order, Pack_Items, and Ship_Order.

The final answer is:
```json
{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Pack_Items",
  "Q3": "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00",
  "Q4": 2,
  "Q5": ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]
}
```
