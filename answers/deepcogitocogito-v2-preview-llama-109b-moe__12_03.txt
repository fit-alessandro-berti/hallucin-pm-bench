Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to determine if the given fact about the event log is accurate. The fact states that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between.

First, I need to look at each case in the log and check the sequence of activities. Let's go through each case one by one.

Case C001:
- Receive_Order at 09:12:00
- Validate_Payment at 09:15:00
- Pack_Items at 10:00:00
Here, after Receive_Order, the next activity is Validate_Payment. So far, this supports the fact.

Case C002:
- Receive_Order at 09:30:00
- Pack_Items at 09:50:00
- Validate_Payment at 10:05:00
In this case, after Receive_Order, the next activity is Pack_Items, not Validate_Payment. This contradicts the fact because there's another activity (Pack_Items) between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.

Case C003:
- Receive_Order at 09:40:00
- Validate_Payment at 09:44:00
- Ship_Order at 11:00:00
Again, after Receive_Order, the next activity is Validate_Payment. This supports the fact.

Case C004:
- Receive_Order at 10:05:00
- Check_Fraud at 10:07:00
- Validate_Payment at 10:20:00
- Pack_Items at 10:45:00
Here, after Receive_Order, the next activity is Check_Fraud, and then Validate_Payment. This also contradicts the fact because there's an activity (Check_Fraud) between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.

So, there are cases (C002 and C004) where Validate_Payment does not immediately follow Receive_Order. Therefore, the fact is not accurate.
**1. Answer:** No

**2. Justification:**
After analyzing the event log, I found that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order." Here are the specific cases that contradict the fact:

- **Case C002**: Receive_Order occurs at 09:30:00, followed by Pack_Items at 09:50:00, and then Validate_Payment at 10:05:00. There is an activity (Pack_Items) between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.

- **Case C004**: Receive_Order occurs at 10:05:00, followed by Check_Fraud at 10:07:00, then Validate_Payment at 10:20:00. There is an activity (Check_Fraud) between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.

While some cases (C001 and C003) support the fact, the existence of even one counterexample is enough to prove that the statement is not universally true for all cases in the event log.
