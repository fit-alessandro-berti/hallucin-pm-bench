Let's break this down step by step:

1. Understanding the vocabulary mandate:
   - "KYC Review" must be used instead of "Customer Due Diligence" or "CDD"
   - "Regulatory Liaison" must be used instead of "Compliance Officer"
   - "Transaction Analyst" must be used instead of "Payment Clerk" or other similar terms

2. Let's map the existing roles to mandated terms:
   - Payment Clerk → Transaction Analyst
   - Compliance Officer → Regulatory Liaison
   - IT Support remains as is since there's no mandated replacement

3. Let's process each step with mandated terms:

   Step 1: 
   - Original: "A payment clerk receives the customer's transfer instruction and logs it in the system."
   - Mandated: "A Transaction Analyst receives and logs customer transfer instructions"

   Step 2:
   - Original: "The clerk screens the payment against the sanctions list"
   - Mandated: "Transaction Analyst screens transactions against sanctions list"

   Step 3: 
   - Original: "A compliance officer performs the customer due diligence check on both sender and beneficiary"
   - Mandated: "Regulatory Liaison performs KYC Review on all parties"

   Step 4: 
   - Original: "If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, the compliance officer must approve it"
   - Mandated: "Regulatory Liaison reviews and approves high-risk transactions"

   Step 5: 
   - Original: "Once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent"
   - Split into two activities for clarity:
     a. "Process payment release"
     b. "Initiate SWIFT transmission"

   Step 6:
   - Original: "Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified"
   - Mandated: "Archive transaction documentation and notify relevant parties"

4. Now, let's create the RACI table:

   Columns will be:
   - Activity
   - Transaction Analyst (TA)
   - Regulatory Liaison (RL)
   - IT Support (IT)
   - (Note: As the instructions specify to use only the mandated terms above, I won't add additional roles)

   RACI definitions:
   - Responsible (R): Who executes the task?
   - Accountable (A): Who has final accountability? (Only one per task)
   - Consulted (C): Who needs to provide input?
   - Informed (I): Who needs to be kept informed of the outcome?

5. Final list of activities with responsible parties:
   1. Receive and log customer transfer instructions
      - R: TA
      - A: TA
   2. Screen transactions against sanctions list
      - R: TA
      - A: TA
   3. Perform KYC Review on all parties
      - R: RL
      - A: RL
   4. Review and approve high-risk transactions
      - R: RL
      - A: RL
   5. Process payment release
      - R: TA
      - A: TA
   6. Initiate SWIFT transmission
      - R: IT
      - A: IT
   7. Archive transaction documentation
      - R: IT
      - A: RL (as they're responsible for compliance)
   8. Notify relevant parties
      - RL should be informed of the archive completion

**Legend:**
- **R** = Responsible (performs the work)
- **A** = Accountable (has final accountability)
- **C** = Consulted (needs to be consulted)
- **I** = Informed (needs to be kept informed)
- **-** = Not involved in this activity

Note: All roles follow the mandated terminology per AtlasRemit's vocabulary policy. The process flow aligns with regulatory requirements while maintaining operational efficiency.
