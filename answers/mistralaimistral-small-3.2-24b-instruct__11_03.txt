**To:** COO, Orion Credit
**Subject:** Three Worst-Performing Activities & Data-Driven Recommendations

Three activities significantly underperform based on SLA breaches and high waiting times:

1. **Risk Review**
   - Exceeds SLA by **300s** (600s actual vs. 300s target).
   - Highest waiting time: **480s**.
   - *Recommendation:* Implement a tiered review system to fast-track low-risk cases, reducing backlog.

2. **Legal Approval**
   - Exceeds SLA by **300s** (900s actual vs. 600s target).
   - Second-highest waiting time: **600s**.
   - *Recommendation:* Automate routine document checks to free up legal team bandwidth.

3. **Credit Assessment**
   - Exceeds SLA by **60s** (300s actual vs. 240s target).
   - High waiting time: **200s**.
   - *Recommendation:* Deploy AI-assisted scoring tools to expedite initial assessments.

These actions target bottlenecks while leveraging existing data.
