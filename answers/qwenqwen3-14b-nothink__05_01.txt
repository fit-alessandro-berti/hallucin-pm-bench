Add a 48-hour timer intermediate catch event after the "Task_Receive" activity, connected to the "GW_Docs" gateway via a sequence flow. If not completed within 48 hours, trigger an auto-escalation by redirecting to "Task_Triage" via a sequence flow from the timer event. This ensures triage occurs on time without adding new tasks. Reference elements: Task_Receive, GW_Docs, and Task_Triage.
