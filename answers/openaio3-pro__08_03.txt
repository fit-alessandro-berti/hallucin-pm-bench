Yes – it is possible.  
A shortest firing sequence in which T5 occurs before any T3 is

 T1  → T2b  → T4  → T5

Step-by-step:

1. T1: p0 → pa + pb  (marking: pa=1, pb=1)  
2. T2b: pa → pd    (marking: pd=1, pb=1)  
3. T4: pb → pe     (marking: pd=1, pe=1)  
4. T5: pd + pe → pf   (marking: pf=1)

Up to and including the firing of T5 no transition T3 has occurred, so T5 fires first.

The sequence is minimal:  
• T1 is mandatory to create pa and pb.  
• pd can then be obtained only via T2b (since we forbid T3), and pe only via T4.  
• After those two firings T5 becomes enabled.  
Thus four transition firings are necessary and sufficient.
