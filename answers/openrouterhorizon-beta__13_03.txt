1) Count of exact activity “Manual Fraud Check”: 1

2) Reasons this snippet can mislead:
- Sampling bias: It’s a tiny slice (few cases on a single morning), not representative of the month.
- Naming variability: Similar steps appear with different labels (“Manual Review”, “Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), so prevalence may differ when standardized.
- Duplicate/variant events: Mixed duplicates (e.g., “Send Offer” twice) show that event frequency per case varies, skewing perceptions.
- Process heterogeneity over time: Fraud-check policies or volumes can shift across days/weeks.
- Case-mix distortion: High/low-risk applications might be over/under-represented in this window.
- Logging practices: Some manual checks might be recorded under other activities or missing in this excerpt.
