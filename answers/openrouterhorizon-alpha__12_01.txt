No. The log shows the opposite order in cases where both activities occur:
- Case 1001: Update_Inventory (08:25:55) occurs before Authorize_Refund (08:30:02).
- Case 1003: Update_Inventory (10:08:07) occurs before Authorize_Refund (10:22:18).

Additionally, case 1002 has Authorize_Refund but no Update_Inventory, so “Authorize_Refund immediately before Update_Inventory” does not occur there either. The claim is inaccurate.
