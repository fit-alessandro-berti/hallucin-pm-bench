**Yes**, it is possible.

### Reasoning (brief)
- **T5** needs tokens in **pd** and **pe**.
- **pe** can be produced via **T4** from **pb** (which comes from **T1**).
- **pd** can be produced *without* using **T3**, via the shortcut **T2b** from **pa** (also produced by **T1**).
So **T5** can be enabled and fired without ever firing **T3**.

### One shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3
1. **T1** (consumes p0; produces pa and pb)
2. **T2b** (consumes pa; produces pd)
3. **T4** (consumes pb; produces pe)
4. **T5** (consumes pd and pe; produces pf)

So the sequence is:

**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

After this, **T3** still has not fired (and in fact cannot have, because **pc** has never been marked).
