Our process mining analysis identified the three activities with the highest (worst) average and 95th percentile waiting times:

1. **Request_Documents**  
   – Avg. Wait: 36.5 h | 95th %: 120.0 h  
   – *Recommendation:* Automate document upload via a portal to reduce queueing and handoffs by ≥ 40%.

2. **Assess_Liability**  
   – Avg. Wait: 7.8 h | 95th %: 16.4 h  
   – *Recommendation:* Parallelize assessment tasks using AI triage to cut queue time by ~25%.

3. **Send_Closure_Letter**  
   – Avg. Wait: 12.2 h | 95th %: 44.0 h  
   – *Recommendation:* Implement auto-scheduling for closure letters post-claim resolution to eliminate manual follow-ups and reduce delays by ≥ 30%.

Addressing these will significantly improve customer experience and cost-to-serve.
