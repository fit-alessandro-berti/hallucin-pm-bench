It is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" because Artefact A explicitly states that every row and every timestamp value has been removed from the event log for privacy purposes. Without the actual start_time and complete_time values for the activity instances, there is no raw data available to calculate duration, variance, or statistical intervals. Furthermore, Artefact B only provides a historical aggregate for a different workflow interval (Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice) and does not contain the granular event data required to derive the specific performance metrics for this current audit.
