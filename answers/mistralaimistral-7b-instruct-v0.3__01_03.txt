 **a) Decision Points in Acme Bank’s Small-Business Loan-Approval Process:**

1. At Receive-Application, the bank receives a completed Form 14B.
2. At Assign-Deck-Reviewer, a Deck Officer is assigned to review the application.
3. During Tri-Color-Risk-Check, the application is assessed using Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow, resulting in a low, medium, or high risk rating.
4. If the risk rating is low or medium and the requested amount is €250,000 or less, the process skips Manual-Underwriting-Review.
5. At Manual-Underwriting-Review, a Deck Memo is prepared for further review.
6. Decision-Gate “TriVote” requires approvals from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer. Any two approvals out of three suffice to pass.
7. At Prepare-Binding-Offer, an Offer Sheet 77 is prepared based on the loan terms.
8. Request-Applicant-Confirmation requires the applicant to sign the Offer Sheet 77 and complete the ID Matrix Declaration.
9. Finalize-Agreement results in the preparation of the Loan Dossier 2025.
