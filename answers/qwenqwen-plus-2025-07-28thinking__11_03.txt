Analysis reveals three activities failing SLA due to excessive breaches and waiting time: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval (900s throughput) breaches its 600s SLA by 300s, with 600s waiting time. Risk Review (600s throughput) breaches its 300s SLA by 300s, with 480s waiting. Credit Assessment (300s throughput) breaches its 240s SLA by 60s, with 200s waiting.  

Recommended actions:  
• Increase staffing for Legal Approval to reduce waiting time by 300 seconds (600s → 300s), addressing its 600s waiting time and 300s SLA breach.  
• Increase staffing for Risk Review to reduce waiting time by 300 seconds (480s → 180s), addressing its 480s waiting time and 300s SLA breach.  
• Increase staffing for Credit Assessment to reduce waiting time by 60 seconds (200s → 140s), addressing its 200s waiting time and 60s SLA breach.
