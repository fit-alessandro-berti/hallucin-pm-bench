### Summary
**Answers:**
1. The activity “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” occurs **1 time**.
2. a) The percentage of all events that include “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” is **2.08%**.
   b) The percentage of all unique cases that include “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” is **8.33%**.
3. In this log excerpt, “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” is a low-support activity, appearing in only 8.33% of cases and 2.08% of events. Such low-support activities can mislead performance analyses by overrepresenting their impact or being overlooked in predictive modeling due to insufficient samples, potentially distorting the understanding of the overall process. For example, its rarity might suggest it’s unimportant, but in reality, it could be critical for certain high-risk claims. Generalizing from this slice may not capture its true role in the broader process.

\boxed{1, 2.08, 8.33}

For Q3 (in ≤100 words):
Low-support activities like "Manual_Fraud_Check" (appearing in 8.33% of cases) can mislead analyses if generalized from this log. Their rarity might distort performance metrics (e.g., making them seem more significant than they are) or cause predictive models to underrepresent their importance. For instance, “Manual_Fraud_Check” may be sporadically crucial in fraud detection but would appear negligible here, leading to incorrect assumptions about the overall process flow and resource needs.

\boxed{1, 2.08, 8.33}
