## Step 1: Understand the given information
The event log header and the high-level frequency table provide information about the activities in the "High-Value Transfer" (HVT) workflow, including their lifecycle transitions (start and complete) and the number of occurrences. However, the timestamps are not provided.

## 2: Identify relevant information for "Dual Authorization"
The activity "Dual Authorization" has both "start" and "complete" lifecycle transitions, each occurring 148,371 times. This suggests that every instance of "Dual Authorization" starts and completes.

## 3: Determine the need for timestamps
To calculate the average cycle time (from start to completion) for "Dual Authorization," we typically need the timestamps for the start and complete events. The cycle time for one instance would be the difference between the completion time and the start time.

## 4: Assess the possibility of calculation without timestamps
Without specific timestamps or any temporal information (like the total duration of all instances or an average duration), we cannot directly calculate the average cycle time. The provided frequency table does not include any timing information.

## 5: Conclusion based on given data
Given that no timestamp information is available and the question specifically asks to use only the provided information, we cannot calculate the average cycle time for "Dual Authorization." The reason is that the necessary temporal data (timestamps or durations) is not supplied.

The average cycle time for the activity “Dual Authorization” cannot be determined because the required timestamp information is not provided.
