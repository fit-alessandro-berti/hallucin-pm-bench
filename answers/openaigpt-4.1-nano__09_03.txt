Given the provided artefacts and the information available, it is **not possible** to compute the average cycle time of the “Approve Invoice” activity, nor its standard deviation or confidence interval. The primary reason is that the event-log stub contains only headers with no actual data entries, timestamps, or values related to individual cases or activity durations. Without the specific start and complete times for each occurrence of the “Approve Invoice” activity across any cases, it is impossible to determine the total duration or variability. Consequently, all required metrics cannot be calculated with the provided information.
