Let me analyze the event log systematically:

1. Case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77 (3 distinct)
2. For A-9321, sequence is: Receive_Order → Validate_Order → Pack_Items → Ship_Order
   So "Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order"
3. Sorting timestamps: earliest is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00
4. "Quality_Check" appears twice (case B-1045 and C-77)
5. Activities never appearing first in any case:
   - Validate_Order (always after Receive_Order)
   - Pack_Items (appears after earlier events)
   - Ship_Order (appears after earlier events)
   - Quality_Check (never first)

Here's the answer in the requested JSON format:

{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Pack_Items",
  "Q3": "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00",
  "Q4": 2,
  "Q5": ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order", "Quality_Check"]
}
