The stated fact is **not accurate**. While the majority of instances of *Validate_Payment* do follow *Receive_Order*, there is one exception: in case C003 (lines 6â€“7), *Validate_Payment* occurs before *Receive_Order*. Specifically, on line 6, *Validate_Payment* happens at 10:43:00, followed by *Receive_Order* at 10:45:00 (line 7). This counterexample invalidates the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order* in the log fragment.
