MEMO – Orion Credit Process Performance
COO – 15 May 2024  

Data for April shows three activities that simultaneously breach their SLA and accumulate the longest queuing delay:  
- Risk Review: 600 s mean throughput vs 300 s SLA → 100 % over target; waiting 480 s (80 % of total).  
- Legal Approval: 900 s vs 600 s SLA → 50 % over target; waiting 600 s (67 % of total).  
- Credit Assessment: 300 s vs 240 s SLA → 25 % over target; waiting 200 s (67 % of total).  

Collectively these steps add 480 cases, so every extra second here propagates directly to end-to-end lead time for ~40 % of our volume.  

Recommendations  
- Re-allocate under-utilised Credit Assessment processors during morning peaks to cut the 200 s queue; simulation indicates a 30 % reduction lifts the step back inside 240 s.  
- Contract an external legal panel to handle the 465 post-risk files; targeting the first 8 h of queue would restore the 600 s SLA without expanding headcount.  
- Double the Risk Review analyst pool on Days 2-4 of each application wave; queue alone would fall below 180 s, bringing mean throughput to 300 s and ending the 100 % breach.
