**Answer 1:**  
No, it is **not possible** for transition **T5** to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

**Answer 2:**  
**Explanation:**  
T5 requires **tokens in both P2 and P5**.  
- Token in P2 is produced by T1 and is not consumed until T3 or T5 fires.
- P5 gets a token only from T4, which in turn requires P4 to be marked.
- P4 can be reached from either T3 (P2 → P4) or T7 (P3 → P4), but to get a token in both P2 and P5 simultaneously:  
  - After T4 fires (P4 → P5), P4 is empty and P2 still holds its token **only if T3 never fired**.  
  - But T4 can only fire after P4 is marked, which requires **T3 or T7 to fire first**.  
Therefore, **T3 must fire before T5**.
