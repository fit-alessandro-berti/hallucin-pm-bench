Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Process – Underperforming Activities

Our analysis of Q1-2025 highlights three activities that require targeted improvement:

1. Request_Documents  
• Performance Issues: An average queueing time of 150 minutes and rework rate of 22.0% significantly exceed other process steps, delaying overall claims resolution.  
• Recommendation: Introduce automation or improved data capture methods at this stage to reduce waiting time and decrease the incidence of rework.

2. Review_Documents  
• Performance Issues: With an average processing time of 25 minutes, high variability (9 minutes), and the highest SLA breach (12.4%), this activity is a clear bottleneck.  
• Recommendation: Implement standardized review protocols and targeted staff training to streamline the process and reduce variability.

3. Initial_Assessment  
• Performance Issues: Although less extreme, an 18-minute wait and a 3.2% SLA breach suggest room for improvement relative to faster stages.  
• Recommendation: Reassess workload distribution and resource allocation to expedite the initial assessment phase.

Further monitoring post-implementation is advised to ensure sustained process improvements.
