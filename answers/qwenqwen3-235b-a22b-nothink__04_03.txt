**Answer:** No  
**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1:** Satisfied. QE occurs once before RA.  
- **Rule 2:** Satisfied. VP occurs after both QE and RA (VP follows RA).  
- **Rule 3:** **Violated.** NA occurs *before* RA, but NA must occur *after both* QE and RA.  
- **Rule 4:** Satisfied. CC occurs after NA and VP.  

The trace violates **Rule 3**, making it non-compliant.
