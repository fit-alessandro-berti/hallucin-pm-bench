Based on the description of **Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder**, the pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel are:

1. **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** (step 2: they may start simultaneously after Create_Work_Order).  
2. **Quality_Check** and **Create_Documentation** (step 4: they begin in parallel right after Fabricate).  

After sorting the pairs alphabetically (both within each pair and in the overall list):  

- Within the first pair: `Create_Documentation` (C) comes before `Quality_Check` (Q).  
- Within the second pair: `Procure_Materials` (P) comes before `Schedule_Machines` (S).  
- Overall list order: The pair starting with `Create_Documentation` (C) comes before the pair starting with `Procure_Materials` (P).  

Final output:  
```
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Procure_Materials    —  Schedule_Machines
```
