**No**

**Justification:**
The trace violates **Rule 3**.

*   **Rule 1 (Satisfied):** `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) precedes `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA).
*   **Rule 2 (Satisfied):** Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.
*   **Rule 3 (Violated):** `Notify_Authorities` occurs **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete. It requires both QE and RA to be finished first.
*   **Rule 4 (Satisfied):** `Close_Case` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
