No

The stated fact is inaccurate because there are instances in the log where *Validate_Payment* does not follow *Receive_Order*. Specifically, for case C003, *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 6 before *Receive_Order* at line 7, which contradicts the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order*. Additionally, for case C005, *Validate_Payment* at line 11 is not preceded by *Receive_Order* within the visible log fragment, further disproving the claim.
