Add a timer on `Start_Claim` (id="Start_Claim") with a 48-hour duration. If the claim hasn’t reached `Task_Triage` (id="Task_Triage") by the timer’s expiration, escalate via a new sequence flow to `Task_Assign` (id="Task_Assign") to trigger auto-escalation. This ensures triage occurs within SLA without new tasks.
