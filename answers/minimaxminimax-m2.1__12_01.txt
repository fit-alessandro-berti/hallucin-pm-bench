No, the fact is not accurate.

**Justification:**
- **Case 1001**: The sequence shows `Update_Inventory` (08:25:55) occurring *before* `Authorize_Refund` (08:30:02), contradicting the claimed order.
- **Case 1003**: The activities are `Update_Inventory` (10:08:07) → `Quality_Check` (10:15:42) → `Authorize_Refund` (10:22:18). Here, `Authorize_Refund` occurs *after* `Update_Inventory`, and not immediately before it. Additionally, `Quality_Check` intervenes between them.
- **Case 1002**: Lacks the `Update_Inventory` activity entirely, so it does not support the claim.

Since Cases 1001 and 1003 explicitly violate the claimed "always occurs immediately before" relationship, the fact is **inaccurate** based on the event log fragment.
