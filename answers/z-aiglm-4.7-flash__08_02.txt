**Question 1.** Yes.

**Question 2.** T1, T2, T7, T4, T5

**Explanation:** Yes. Start by firing T1, which produces P1 and P2 (leaving P2 available). Fire T2, then T7 (producing P4), and finally T4 (producing P5). At this point, the marking contains both P2 and P5, allowing T5 to fire without ever triggering T3.
