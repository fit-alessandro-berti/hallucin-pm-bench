1. **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
   **Answer:** 1  

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
   - Total number of events = 18  
   - Number of "Manual_Fraud_Check" events = 1  
   - Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 = **5.56%**  
   **Answer:** 5.56%  

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  
   **Answer:** A1002  

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - The log fragment covers only a single day (May 1, 2025), which is not representative of an entire month’s activity. Extrapolating from one day to a full month assumes consistent behavior and volume, which may not hold.  
   - The fragment includes only 4 cases, which is a very small sample size. This limited sample may not capture the variability or true frequency of fraud checks across a larger population of cases over time.
