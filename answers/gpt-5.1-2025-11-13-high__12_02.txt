No. In cases C001 (lines 1–2), C002 (3–5), and C004 (8–9), *Validate_Payment* does follow *Receive_Order*, but in case C003 the order is reversed: *Validate_Payment* occurs first at line 6 and *Receive_Order* only later at line 7. Additionally, in case C005 *Validate_Payment* appears at line 11 without any *Receive_Order* event in that case. Therefore, *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* in the given log fragment.
