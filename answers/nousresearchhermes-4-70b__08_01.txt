The answer is **yes**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Concrete Firing Sequence:**
1. (Initial Marking)  p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
2. Transition T1 fires  
   (Standard Petri net rule: one token is removed from p0 and added to each of p1 and p2.)  
 New Marking: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
3. Transition T2 (enabled by token in p1) fires  
   One token is removed from p1; one token is added to p3.)  
 New Marking: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
4. Transition T5 fires  
   T5 is enabled when p3 has ≥ 1 token and p4 (via inhibitor arc) has 0 tokens.  
   One token is removed from p3; one token is added to p6.)  
 Final Marking: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1)

T5 fires before T3 because T3 never fired in the sequence. The net’s structure lets T5 occur once its two local conditions are met—independent of the rest of the net—including T3’s prerequisites.

Thus, the answer is “yes”, as proven by the above sequence.
