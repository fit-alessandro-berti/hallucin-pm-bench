Subject: SLA and waiting-time hotspots in the application-to-funding flow

Three activities stand out as worst-performing when considering both SLA breaches and high waiting time. Legal Approval averages 900s throughput versus a 600s SLA (+300s) and carries 600s average waiting across 465 cases. Risk Review averages 600s versus a 300s SLA (+300s) with 480s average waiting across 480 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s versus a 240s SLA (+60s) with 200s average waiting across 1175 cases. In all three, waiting time is the dominant lever: non-wait components are 300s (Legal Approval), 120s (Risk Review), and 100s (Credit Assessment), so SLA compliance requires cutting waiting to 300s, 180s, and 140s respectively.

- Legal Approval: reduce average waiting from 600s to 300s (−300s) by adding dedicated same-day review capacity until the +300s SLA gap closes.  
- Risk Review: reduce average waiting from 480s to 180s (−300s) by enforcing a strict queue-age limit and prioritizing the 480-case backlog.  
- Credit Assessment: reduce average waiting from 200s to 140s (−60s) by reallocating capacity from steps already under SLA to Credit Assessment during peak queues.
