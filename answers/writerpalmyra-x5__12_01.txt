No, the fact is not accurate.

In Case 1001, “Authorize_Refund” occurs at 2025-03-01 08:30:02, *after* “Update_Inventory” at 2025-03-01 08:25:55.  
In Case 1003, “Update_Inventory” occurs at 2025-03-03 10:08:07, followed by “Quality_Check”, then “Authorize_Refund” at 10:22:18 — meaning “Authorize_Refund” does not occur immediately before “Update_Inventory”.

Thus, the data show that “Authorize_Refund” does not always occur immediately before “Update_Inventory”.
