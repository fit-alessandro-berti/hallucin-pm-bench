**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance**  

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Top 3 Underperforming Activities & Recommendations  

Analysis of Q1-2025 metrics identifies three critical bottlenecks:  

1. **Review_Documents**  
   - **Why:** Highest SLA breaches (12.4%) and rework (5.3%), driven by long processing time (25 mins, stdev=9). Variability suggests inconsistent execution.  
   - **Action:** Standardize review protocols and implement staff training to reduce variability and rework. Target 20% reduction in avg_processing_time.  

2. **Request_Documents**  
   - **Why:** Extreme rework rate (22%) and longest wait time (150 mins). Low processing time (5 mins) indicates delays stem from external dependencies or unclear requests.  
   - **Action:** Introduce automated, template-based document requests to reduce ambiguity and rework. Monitor impact on wait time.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - **Why:** Second-highest wait time (18 mins) and 3.2% SLA breaches. High throughput (270/day) suggests resource constraints.  
   - **Action:** Reallocate staff to balance workload; target 25% reduction in wait time.  

Other activities show acceptable performance. Prioritize these three for immediate intervention.
