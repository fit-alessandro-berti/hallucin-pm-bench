To address the 48-hour SLA for reaching `Task_Triage` without adding new activities, add an interrupting boundary timer event (`Event_SlaTimer`) to `Task_Check`.

Configure this timer to fire 48 hours after the process starts. Add a sequence flow from `Event_SlaTimer` directly to `Task_Notify`.

This models that if the process hasn't passed `Task_Check` (and therefore hasn't reached `Task_Triage`) within 48 hours, the timer interrupts the current work and triggers an automated process jump to `Task_Notify`, allowing for communication about the SLA breach instead of standard processing.
