Executive Memo: SLA Breach Review

Our process-performance analysis identifies the three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches and average waiting times. Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds and endures a 600-second wait for 465 cases. Risk Review breaches its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds with a 480-second wait across 480 cases. Credit Assessment surpasses its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds and incurs a 200-second wait over 1,175 cases. These three activities account for a combined 2,120 cases, representing the highest-volume SLA failure points.

Recommendations:
- Legal Approval: Integrate e-signature and parallelize final reviews to cut the 600-second average wait by 300 seconds and close the 300-second SLA breach.
- Risk Review: Automate preliminary risk checks to reduce average waiting time from 480s to 300s, cutting 180s of queue delay.
- Credit Assessment: Deploy a rule-based credit decision engine to trim average throughput time from 300s to 240s, eliminating the 60s SLA breach.
