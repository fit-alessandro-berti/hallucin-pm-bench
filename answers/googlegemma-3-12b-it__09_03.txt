1. I cannot compute the average cycle time of the "Approve Invoice" activity, nor its standard deviation or 95% confidence interval. The provided event log stub (Artefact A) lacks any actual dataâ€”specifically, it contains only the column headers but no row entries with associated start and complete times for individual cases. Without this temporal data for the activity "Approve Invoice" within cases, calculating any time-based metrics is impossible.
