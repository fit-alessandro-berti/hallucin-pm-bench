**1️⃣ Count:** The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in the provided excerpt.  

**2️⃣ Explanation:**  
An analyst viewing only this short excerpt might misestimate the prevalence of manual fraud checks because the sample covers a very limited time window (a few hours on 01 Mar 2025) and only three cases. Case selection may not be representative—activity proportions can vary through the month depending on case volumes, risk profiles, or policy triggers. Without the full month’s data, the observed single occurrence could significantly under‑ or over‑represent the true frequency, leading to inaccurate conclusions about how often manual fraud checks occur overall.
