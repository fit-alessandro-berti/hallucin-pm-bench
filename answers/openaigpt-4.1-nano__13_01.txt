1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.

2. Total number of logged events = 18  
Number of "Manual_Fraud_Check" events = 1

Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ 5.56%

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why this estimate is unreliable:  
- **Small sample size:** With only a fragment of 18 log lines, the sample may not accurately reflect the true frequency of manual fraud checks over a longer period.  
- **Limited scope and timeframe:** The data covers only a single day (May 1, 2025), which may not represent typical behavior or variability across different days or months.
