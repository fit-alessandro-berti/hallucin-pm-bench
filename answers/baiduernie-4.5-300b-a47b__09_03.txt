1. The average cycle time (in hours) of activity “Approve Invoice” cannot be computed because the event log contains no timestamp data or raw event data—only column headers are provided, and no durations or timestamps are available.

2. The standard deviation and 95% confidence interval cannot be computed for the same reason: there is no underlying data on individual cycle times for “Approve Invoice,” so neither variability nor statistical intervals can be determined.

3. Precise reason: All timestamp and event-duration data have been redacted; only the structure of the log is visible. Without timestamps or complete case-level information tied to “Approve Invoice,” no calculations on duration, mean, variance, or confidence intervals are possible from the provided artefacts.
