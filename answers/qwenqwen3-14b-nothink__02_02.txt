### **Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

The distinct cases are:  
- `C001`  
- `C002`  
- `C003`

**Answer: 3**

---

### **Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

Looking at the events for case `C002`:

- Line 2: `Receive_Order`
- Line 5: `Check_Stock`
- Line 8: `Arrange_Delivery`
- Line 10: `Ship_Order`

**Answer:**  
`Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`

---

### **Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**

Now we look for any activity that directly precedes `Ship_Order` in the event logs:

- Case `C001`:  
  - `Check_Stock → Ship_Order`  
  - So `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order`

- Case `C002`:  
  - `Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`  
  - So `Arrange_Delivery` precedes `Ship_Order`

- Case `C003`:  
  - `Check_Stock → Ship_Order`  
  - So `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order`

**Distinct activities that immediately precede “Ship_Order”:**  
- `Arrange_Delivery`  
- `Check_Stock`

**Alphabetically ordered:**

**Answer:**
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
