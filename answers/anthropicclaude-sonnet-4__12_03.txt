**No**

**Justification:**

The FACT is incorrect. Looking at the event-log excerpt, "Validate_Payment" does NOT always occur immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between.

**Counter-examples:**

1. **Case C002**: The sequence is Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment
   - Validate_Payment occurs after Pack_Items, not immediately after Receive_Order

2. **Case C004**: The sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items
   - Validate_Payment occurs after Check_Fraud, not immediately after Receive_Order

**Cases that do follow the pattern:**
- **Case C001**: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment ✓
- **Case C003**: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment ✓

Since the FACT claims this pattern occurs "always" but 2 out of 4 cases (C002 and C004) have other activities between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, the statement is false.
