No

The claim is inaccurate because in lines 6–7 (Case C003), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 10:43Z and is followed by *Receive_Order* at 10:45Z, meaning *Validate_Payment* precedes *Receive_Order* — directly contradicting the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order*. Additionally, Case C005 (lines 11–12) shows *Validate_Payment* followed by *Cancel_Order* without any prior *Receive_Order*, further violating the asserted sequence. Thus, the stated fact is falsified by at least two instances in the log.
