Insert an Event-Based Gateway after `Start_Claim`. Route one sequence flow from this gateway to the existing `Task_Receive`. Add a second flow to a new Timer Intermediate Event (e.g., `Timer_Escalate`) set for a 48-hour duration. Connect the output of this timer event directly to `Task_Triage`. This creates a race: the process either follows the normal path through `Task_Receive` and `Task_Check`, or if 48 hours pass, the timer fires and auto-escalates the claim directly to `Task_Triage`. This guarantees the SLA is met without adding new tasks.
