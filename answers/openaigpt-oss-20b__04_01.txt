**Non‑compliant**

**Justification**

1. **Rule 2** – Because the trace contains `Expedite_Flag`, `Risk_Assessment` *must* occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurs after `Ship_Goods` (event 8), violating the required precedence.

2. **Rule 3** – After `Goods_Received` (`event 6`), the activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (`distance ≤ 2`). In the trace, `Three_way_match` occurs at `event 10`, which is four activities away from `Goods_Received`, violating the distance constraint.
