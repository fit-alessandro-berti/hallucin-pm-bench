I cannot compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Approve Invoice”, nor the standard deviation or 95% confidence interval, because the event log (Artefact A) has all row data and timestamp values fully redacted for privacy reasons—only column headers remain. Cycle time requires calculating differences between start_time and complete_time specifically for rows where activity is “Approve Invoice”, but no actual timestamps or case-level data are provided to enable this. The SLA catalogue (Artefact B) offers historical averages unrelated to the current log, providing no substitute data.
