The fact is **INACCURATE** with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification:**

Looking at the cases where both "Authorize_Refund" and "Update_Inventory" occur:

- **Case 1001**: The sequence shows "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02), not after it.

- **Case 1003**: Similarly, "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund" (10:15:42), not after it.

In both cases where these activities appear together, "Update_Inventory" precedes "Authorize_Refund", which is the opposite of what the fact claims. Case 1002 does not include "Update_Inventory" at all, so it provides no evidence either way.
