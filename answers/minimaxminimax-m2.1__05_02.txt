1. Unified diff:
```diff
-    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_5" sourceRef="Task_CollectEquipment" targetRef="Task_GrantAccess"/>
+    <bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_5" sourceRef="Task_GrantAccess" targetRef="Task_CollectEquipment"/>
```

2. Reversing Flow_5 enables parallel execution of "Grant System Access" and "Collect Equipment," reducing total process time from 12 days to 7 days.
