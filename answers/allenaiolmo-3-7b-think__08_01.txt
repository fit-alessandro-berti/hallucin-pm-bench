Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3 in a reachable marking. Here's a concrete firing sequence:

**Firing Sequence:**
1. **Initial Marking:** \( p_0(1) \), \( p_1(0) \), \( p_2(0) \), \( p_3(0) \), \( p_4(0) \), \( p_5(0) \), \( p_6(0) \).
2. **Fire T1:**  
   - \( p_0 \) loses 1 token → \( p_0(0) \).  
   - \( p_1 \) gains 1 → \( p_1(1) \).  
   - \( p_2 \) gains 1 → \( p_2(1) \).  
   **New Marking:** \( p_1(1) \), \( p_2(1) \), others 0.  

3. **Fire T2:**  
   - \( p_1 \) loses 1 → \( p_1(0) \).  
   - \( p_3 \) gains 1 → \( p_3(1) \).  
   **New Marking:** \( p_2(1) \), \( p_3(1) \), others 0.  

4. **Fire T5:**  
   - \( p_3 \) loses 1 (due to T5's normal arc) → \( p_3(0) \).  
   - \( p_6 \) gains 1 → \( p_6(1) \).  
   - **Critical Check:** T5 is enabled because \( p_4 = 0 \) (satisfies the inhibitor condition) and \( p_3 \geq 1 \).  
   **New Marking:** \( p_2(1) \), \( p_3(0) \), \( p_4(0) \), \( p_6(1) \).  

At this point, **T3 can still fire** (since \( p_2 = 1 \)), but **T5 has already fired before T3** in this sequence.  

### Justification:
- T5 requires \( p_3 \geq 1 \) and \( p_4 = 0 \). After firing T2, these conditions are satisfied (\( p_3 = 1 \), \( p_4 = 0 \)), enabling T5.  
- T3 cannot fire before T5 in this path because T3 requires \( p_2 \) to have a token, but T3’s firing would *increase* \( p_4 \), disabling T5 afterward.  

Thus, the sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** demonstrates that T5 can fire before T3 in a reachable marking.  

**Answer:**  
Yes. A firing sequence is **T1 → T2 → T5**. In the marking after T1 and T2, T5 is enabled (p3=1, p4=0), allowing it to fire before T3 (which requires p2 to still have a token).
