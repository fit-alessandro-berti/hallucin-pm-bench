The fact is inaccurate because in case C003 (lines 6-7), *Validate_Payment* (line 6) occurs **before** *Receive_Order* (line 7), contradicting the claim that it always follows. Additionally, in case C005 (lines 11-12), *Validate_Payment* (line 11) appears without any preceding *Receive_Order* event in the log. These exceptions disprove the universal "always follows" assertion.
