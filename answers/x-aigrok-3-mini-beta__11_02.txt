**Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Analysis**

Dear COO,

Based on the Q1-2025 dashboard for Acme Insurance's Claims Handling process, the three worst-performing activities are Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment.

1. **Request_Documents** under-performs due to the highest average wait time (150 minutes) and rework rate (22.0%), indicating significant delays and repeats. **Recommendation:** Introduce automated document tracking to reduce wait times by 50% and minimize rework through real-time status updates.

2. **Review_Documents** shows poor performance with the longest average processing time (25 minutes), highest variability (9 minutes), rework rate (5.3%), and SLA breaches (12.4%), reflecting inefficiency and inconsistency. **Recommendation:** Develop standardized checklists based on variability data to cut processing time by at least 20% and lower SLA breaches.

3. **Initial_Assessment** lags with a high average wait time (18 minutes) and SLA breaches (3.2%) relative to early activities, suggesting queue buildup. **Recommendation:** Allocate additional resources during peak hours to reduce wait time to under 10 minutes and improve SLA compliance.

These insights aim to enhance process efficiency. (148 words)
