**Decision Points in Contoso’s Flight-Refund Process:**

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** – Determines if the submission meets criteria based on *FlightManifest* (e.g., departure cancellation status) and *WeatherReport* (e.g., severe weather justification).  
2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** – Approves the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist* to confirm compliance and readiness for refund.  
   - *Note*: No overload of this decision on refund amount in this process — High-value branch handling is separate.
