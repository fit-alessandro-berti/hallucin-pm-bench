**a) Summary of Decision Points (Gates or Conditional Branches):**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check → Risk Rating Assignment**  
   A risk rating (Low, Medium, High) is assigned based on the combined outcome of the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow scorecards.

2. **Conditional Branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check**  
   If the risk rating is *Low* or *Medium* **and** the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, the process skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review (step 5); otherwise, it proceeds to step 5.

3. **Decision-Gate “TriVote” (Step 6)**  
   The loan must receive approval from at least two out of the three required roles—Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer—to pass.
