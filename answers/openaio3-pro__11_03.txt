Subject: Priority SLA and queue bottlenecks  

The latest extract covering 1,200 applications highlights three stages where SLA overruns coincide with long waits.  

Legal Approval averages 900 s—300 s over its 600 s SLA—and adds 600 s waiting across 465 cases.  
Risk Review takes 600 s against a 300 s SLA, with 480 s waiting on 480 cases.  
Credit Assessment runs 300 s, 60 s above its 240 s SLA, plus 200 s waiting on 1,175 cases.  

Recommended actions  
• Legal Approval: reassign one legal FTE from Draft Offer (30 s wait) to cut the 600 s queue and erase the 300 s overrun.  
• Risk Review: add a fast-track lane for lower-risk files, diverting half of the 480 cases to bring waits toward 300 s.  
• Credit Assessment: implement automated scoring to remove the 200 s queue and recover the 60 s SLA gap.
