**1. Occurrence Count**  
The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs exactly **1** time in the provided log (in case C05).

**2. Percentages**  
*   **a) All events:** 2.08% (1 out of 48 events)
*   **b) All unique cases:** 8.33% (1 out of 12 cases)

**3. Impact on Analyses**  
A low-support activity appearing only once lacks statistical significance. If we generalize from this single instance, performance metrics—like average duration or bottleneck severity—will reflect an isolated event rather than typical behavior. In predictive analysis, machine learning models may either overfit to the unique characteristics of this single case (C05) or ignore the manual check pathway entirely due to extreme class imbalance. Consequently, generalizing from this slice misrepresents the true processing times, resource requirements, and routing probabilities of manual checks in the broader process.
