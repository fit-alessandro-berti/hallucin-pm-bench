**Question 1.** Yes.

**Question 2 (bonus).** 
Minimal firing sequence: **T1, T2, T7, T4, T5**.

**Explanation:**
Transition **T5** requires tokens from both **P2** and **P5**. While **T3** can produce the **P4** necessary to eventually mark **P5**, it consumes the token in **P2** to do so. Since **P2** only receives one token (via **T1**), firing **T3** effectively disables **T5**.

However, the net provides an alternative path to **P4** via **T2** and **T7** (**P1 → P3 → P4**). This path utilizes the token in **P1** and preserves the token in **P2**. Following this sequence allows the net to reach a marking where both **P2** and **P5** are marked, enabling **T5** to fire without **T3** ever having fired.
