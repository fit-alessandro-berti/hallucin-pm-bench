1. **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
   Answer: **1**

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
   Total number of events = 18  
   Percentage = (1 / 18) * 100 ≈ **5.56%**

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  
   Answer: **A1002**

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   - **Limited Time Frame**: The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01); it is not representative of a full month, and assumes no variation over time.  
   - **Small Sample Size**: The fragment contains only 4 cases (A1001–A1004) and only one instance of “Manual_Fraud_Check”. This small sample provides insufficient data for reliable frequency estimation.
