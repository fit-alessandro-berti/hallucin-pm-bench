COO, based on the provided throughput vs Target SLA and average waiting times, the three worst-performing activities are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval averages 900s throughput against a 600s SLA (exceeding by 300s) with a 600s average waiting time across 465 cases. Risk Review averages 600s throughput against a 300s SLA (exceeding by 300s) with a 480s waiting time across 480 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s throughput against a 240s SLA (exceeding by 60s) with a 200s waiting time across 1,175 cases.

- Legal Approval: Rebalance capacity from low-wait steps (Receive Application 10s; Draft Offer 30s; Customer Acceptance 15s) to reduce the 600s wait and close the 300s SLA breach across 465 cases.
- Risk Review: Increase review capacity to cut the 480s wait and the 300s SLA breach affecting 480 cases; prioritize scheduling to match this queue length.
- Credit Assessment: Add capacity to reduce the 200s wait and eliminate the 60s SLA breach; this step has the highest volume (1,175 cases), making impact broad.
