1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time** in the fragment.  
2. This represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1/18 â‰ˆ 0.0556).  
3. The case identifier containing "Manual_Fraud_Check" is **A1002**.  
4. Two sampling-related reasons the estimate is unreliable:  
   - **Limited time frame**: The data covers only a single day (May 1, 2025), which may not reflect monthly patterns (e.g., fraud checks could vary by day of the week or month).  
   - **Small sample size**: Only 4 cases are included, making the fragment statistically insignificant for extrapolating to a monthly frequency.
