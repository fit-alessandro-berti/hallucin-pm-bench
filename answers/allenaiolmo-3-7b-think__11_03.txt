Subject: Identification of Three Worst-Performing Activities and Recommendations  

Dear [COO],  

Based on a combined evaluation of SLA overages and prolonged customer wait times, **Legal Approval** (150% SLA breach, 600s waiting), **Risk Review** (100% SLA breach, 480s waiting), and **Credit Assessment** (25% SLA breach, 200s waiting) were identified as the top three worst performers. These activities represent critical bottlenecks in our process efficiency.  

Recommendations:  
- **Legal Approval**: Automate document review workflows using AI tools to reduce processing time by ~40%.  
- **Risk Review**: Implement parallel processing and temporary staffing to meet SLA targets.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Streamline data validation protocols to decrease processing time by 20%.  

This addresses key inefficiencies impacting customer satisfaction and operational effectiveness.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
