1. **Count of “Manual_Fraud_Check”**: **1**  
2. **Percentage of all events**: \(1/18 \times 100 = 5.56\%\)  
3. **Cases containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”**: **A1002**  
4. **Two sampling‑related reasons the monthly estimate is unreliable**:  
   - **Tiny sample size** (only 18 events / 4 cases), so the estimate has very high variance.  
   - **Narrow time window** (a few hours on a single day), so it is not representative of an entire month and may be biased.
