**Question 1.** No.

**Question 2.** 
T5 cannot fire before T3 because T3 is the only transition that can provide a token to place P4, which is the immediate and only predecessor for T4. In turn, T4 is the only transition that provides a token to place P5. Since T5 requires a token from P5 to fire, the causal chain **T3 → T4 → T5** must be strictly followed. 

Additionally, T3 and T5 both consume a token from P2. For T5 to fire, it must consume the token from P2 *and* a token from P5. Since that token in P5 only exists after T3 has already consumed the token from P2 to reach P4 (and then T4 to P5), T5 is logically dead in this specific net structure.
