a) Decision points in Acme Bank’s small-business loan process  

1. Tri-Color-Risk-Check – the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) jointly classify the application as Low, Medium, or High risk.  
2. Manual-Underwriting bypass rule – if the risk result is Low or Medium AND the amount requested is ≤ €250 000, the Manual-Underwriting-Review step is skipped; otherwise that review is performed.  
3. “TriVote” gate – the loan proceeds only when at least two of the three gatekeepers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) give an approval.  
4. Applicant-Confirmation gate – the deal moves to Finalize-Agreement only after the applicant returns a Signed Offer Sheet 77 together with the ID Matrix Declaration.
