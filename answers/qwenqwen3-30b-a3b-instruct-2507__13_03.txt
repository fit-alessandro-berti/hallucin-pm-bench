1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because the excerpt is a small, non-representative sample. It includes only 3 cases (1001, 1002, 1003), with just one instance of “Manual Fraud Check.” The full log for March 2025 may contain thousands of cases, with many others involving manual checks. The snippet lacks statistical weight, and the system may route more applications to manual review based on risk factors not evident in this data. Without seeing the full distribution, the analyst might incorrectly assume manual checks are rare, when in reality they could be common for higher-risk cases.
