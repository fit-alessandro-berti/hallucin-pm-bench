Attach an **interrupting timer boundary event** (48h duration) to **Task_Receive** and route it directly to **Task_Triage**. If claim receipt exceeds 48 hours, the timer fires, auto-escalating by forcing progression to triage and bypassing Task_Check, GW_Docs, and Task_RequestDocs, thus meeting the SLA.
