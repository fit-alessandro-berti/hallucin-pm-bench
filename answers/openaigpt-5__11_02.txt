COO Brief: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Underperformers and fixes

1) Review_Documents
- Why: Highest SLA breaches (12.4%), long processing (25 min) with high variability (stdev 9) and elevated wait (30 min) indicate a capacity/complexity bottleneck.
- Action: Introduce triage by complexity with a specialist queue for complex cases to cut mean and variability; track SLA breach weekly.

2) Request_Documents
- Why: Extreme wait time (150 min, highest), very high rework (22%) and a throughput drop (270→190) show repeated document cycles are clogging the queue; SLA breaches at 5.5% reinforce the impact.
- Action: Mandate a standardized, system-validated document checklist at handoff (block next step until complete) to reduce rework.

3) Initial_Assessment
- Why: Third-highest wait (18 min) and moderate processing (12 min) with variability (stdev 4) drive the third-highest SLA breach rate (3.2%).
- Action: Deploy a guided assessment template (required fields and decision prompts) to reduce processing-time variability and SLA breaches.

Note: Other activities show low waits, low variability, and minimal SLA breaches; the three above are clearly differentiated by the worst SLA, rework, and queueing metrics.
