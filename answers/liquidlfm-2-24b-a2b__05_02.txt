1. Unified diff of the XML (single hunk):
```xml
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_4" sourceRef="Task_SignContract" targetRef="Task_CollectEquipment"/>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_5" sourceRef="Task_CollectEquipment" targetRef="Task_GrantAccess" camunda:dueDate="P4D"/>
```
2. Rationale: Extending the due date of *Task_CollectEquipment* from P5D to P4D aligns its deadline with the subsequent *Task_GrantAccess* activity, reducing the risk of SLA breaches due to delayed equipment collection.
