1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt.

2.
   a) **Percentage of all events (48 total):**
      \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 = 2.08\% \) (rounded to two decimals).
   b) **Percentage of all unique cases (12 total):**
      \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 = 8.33\% \) (rounded to two decimals).

3.
   A low-support activity like **Manual_Fraud_Check** (1/12 cases) can mislead analyses if generalized because it may appear as an outlier or noise rather than a meaningful pattern. Predictive models trained on this slice might overlook its significance, leading to biased decisions (e.g., underestimating fraud risks or misclassifying cases). Process mining metrics (e.g., conformance checks) could also fail to detect deviations if the activity is rare, masking inefficiencies or exceptions. Without sufficient data, such activities risk being dismissed as anomalies rather than critical process variants.
