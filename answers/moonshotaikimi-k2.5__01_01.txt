**Decision Points**

1. **Eligibility Validation** (activity: *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*)  
   The triage agent decides whether the claim is valid by checking it against the *FlightManifest* and the *WeatherReport*.

2. **Financial Pre‑Approval** (activity: *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*)  
   The finance controller decides whether to sign off on the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*.

3. **High‑Value Threshold Assessment** (process gateway following pre‑approval)  
   The process evaluates whether the refund amount is **greater than €1 000**.  
   * If true, the case must complete *Senior_Auditor_Review* (which requires the *AuditTrail*) before proceeding to payment.  
   * If false, the case moves directly to payment after pre‑approval.
