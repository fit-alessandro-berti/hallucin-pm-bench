R1 – Compliant  
Amount > €10,000 and Manager_Approval (3/3) is followed by Finance_Approval (3/4) before further processing.

R2 – Violated  
Expedited = true; Ship_Goods occurs before the new post-change Manager_Approval, not after the last required approval.

R3 – Violated  
Pay_Invoice (3/6 09:00) occurs before Receive_Goods (3/7 14:13).

R4 – Not Applicable  
hazardous = false, so no Safety_Inspection requirement applies.

R5 – Violated  
Change_Request after approvals; Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occur before the new Manager_Approval on 3/7.

R6 – Compliant  
Case ends with Archive_Record as the final event.

Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT
