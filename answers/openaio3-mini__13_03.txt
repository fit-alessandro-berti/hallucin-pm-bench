1️⃣ The activity "Manual Fraud Check" occurs exactly once.

2️⃣ The snippet only shows a few cases from one day and a limited set of events. Therefore, it may not capture all process variants or manual fraud checks that occurred throughout the entire month. Temporal sampling or selection bias might lead analysts to underestimate the frequency if other cases with manual fraud checks fall outside this excerpt. Additionally, if the process is subject to periodic adjustments or special circumstances on different days, using only this small snippet does not provide a representative picture of the full month's event log.
