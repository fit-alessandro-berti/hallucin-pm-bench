1) 1 occurrence.

2) 5.56% of all logged events (1 out of 18).

3) Case: A1002.

4) The estimate is unreliable because:  
- The fragment is a tiny, non-random sample (only 18 events across 4 cases), so one occurrence may not reflect the true rate.  
- It covers only a narrow time slice (events from a single day), not the full month, so it may miss day-of-week/period effects or variability across the month.
