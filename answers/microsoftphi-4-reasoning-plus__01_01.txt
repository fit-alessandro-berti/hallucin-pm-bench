User said: "Summarise every decision point in Contoso's process and list all required documents. Do not introduce any activities or artefacts that are not defined above."

Let's read the process provided and then answer the question.

Provided process tasks in order:

1. Customer_Submit_Claim (the passenger completes a RefundRequestForm online) - No decision point, this seems to be capturing input by the passenger, document: RefundRequestForm (the form?). Optionally, it's submission of claim.
2. Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility: a triage agent checks the claim against the FlightManifest and the WeatherReport. In this step, the decision is from the eligibility check. "validate eligibility" means that agent performs a decision whether claim is valid? But it's not unclear if the triage agent's decision is a "branch" or a "decision point" itself. Possibly a yes/no decision: eligible or not. But text doesn't define decision points explicitly. Also constraints, the process chain is described. But "decision point" probably refers to the branch condition for high-value refund.

3. Finance_Controller_PreApprove: a finance controller signs off using an EligibilityChecklist. This is functioning as approval stage, but could possibly be a decision point of preapproval. But not a decision point.

4. High-value branch: if the refund amount is greater than €1 000, the case proceeds to Senior_Auditor_Review, which must include the AuditTrail. So here we see a branch decision: How the refund amount is compared to threshold €1 000 then two different decisions: if refund > €1 000, proceed to Senior_Auditor_Review; else skip it. So decision point: refund amount decision needs to check if > €1000.

5. Process_Refund_Payment: the finance team executes payment once the signed BankTransferAuthorization is present, but note that this activity can only be started after Finance_Controller_PreApprove (and for high-value claims Senior_Auditor_Review has been completed). So the required condition is maybe the presence of all documents: BankTransferAuthorization (for refund payment) and output from process.

6. Issue_Confirmation_Letter: system emails RefundConfirmationPDF to the passenger. So nothing decision point.

Constraints: The Finance_Controller_PreApprove must succeed and for high-value claims Senior_Auditor_Review has been completed before Process_Refund_Payment.

Also, "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" activity does not exist. But we ignore that.

Thus answer. Summarise every decision point. So decision points in process:

From process description, decision points are: "Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility" which decides if claim is valid? But likely a decision point if false? However, instructions: "Summarise every decision point in Contoso’s process" So how to define decision points: There's explicit branch for high-value branch. The process description might be a bit ambiguous if Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility is also a decision point. Did we have any instructions that say "decision points at each step"? The letter: Summarise every decision point. Only activity that is an explicit branching decisions step is the high-value claim branch if refund > €1 000. However, the Triage_agent validate eligibility could be considered as a decision point that checks claim eligibility. The question asks: "Summarise every decision point and list all required documents." So which activities are decision points? "CustomerSubmitClaim" is not a decision point as it is just submission. "Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility" may incorporate decisions about invalid claim? It may be known that triage agent would decide if the claim is eligible or not. But the process doesn't say if claim is rejected/accepted? But it says "checks claim against FlightManifest and WeatherReport" - that is part of validation. Perhaps we can say that this step is a decision point that confirms whether claim is eligible based on schedule or weather. But text is not explicit if that step includes a decision: it only says "a triage agent checks the claim" which implies decisions: "eligible or not" maybe "for a refund"? Could be: "if not eligible then claim is rejected" but not mentioned. However, "Process_Payment" condition; must only start after pre-approval and for high value also after Senior Auditor Review. That implies that also Finance_Controller_PreApprove is a decision as well? But process description doesn't say that finance controller "approves" or "disapproves". It says "Finance_Controller_PreApprove" meaning they use EligibilityChecklist. So does that signify a yes/no decision? It might, but nothing precise is said.

Maybe identify the decision points as following:
- Triage agent decision: check eligibility against FlightManifest and WeatherReport (decision: eligible or not).
- High-value branch: decision point to check refund amount vs €1000 threshold to see if Senior_Auditor_Review is required.
- process refund payment decision: check that Finance_Controller_PreApprove is succeeded, and if claim is high-value Senior_Auditor_Review must be finished.

Maybe the note: "Process_Refund_Payment may begin only after Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded and, for high-value claims, Senior_Auditor_Review has been completed." There is also condition that for high-value claimsSenior Auditor Review must be completed. 
- So the Finance_Controller_PreApprove decision can be seen as a decision point: perform pre-approval using eligibility checklist? But typically pre-approval means sign off or ticking.
- Also senior auditor review: then there's the BankTransferAuthorization document requirement.

Required documents: So we have:
Documents required in the process: 
Within the process, these documents appear:
RefundRequestForm (submitted by customer)
FlightManifest and WeatherReport (for triage agent eligibility check).
EligibilityChecklist (for finance controller pre-approve).
AuditTrail for Senior_Auditor_Review (for high-value refund - specifically "which must include the AuditTrail").
BankTransferAuthorization (for processing refund payment).
RefundConfirmationPDF ( emailed to passenger).

Let's check the process: 
Activity: 
Customer_Submit_Claim uses a "RefundRequestForm". 
Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility uses "FlightManifest" and "WeatherReport". 
Finance_Controller_PreApprove uses "EligibilityChecklist". 
High-value branch: Senior_Auditor_Review must have "AuditTrail". 
Process_Refund_Payment requires a signed "BankTransferAuthorization". 
Issue_Confirmation_Letter sends "RefundConfirmationPDF".

That seem all the documents.

We must make sure we don't invent any extra ones. Also as constraint, do not mention CustomerService_Agent_Decide. But we must not include it. Also do not add e.g "Pre-authorization certificate" or any not in definitions.

Thus mention: Document that when performing Triage_Validation: documents: FlightManifest and WeatherReport.
Then for Finance_Controller_PreApprove: EligibilityChecklist. 
For Senior_Auditor_Review, if triggered, require AuditTrail (this document is required if the claim is high-value, refund amount > €1000).
For Process_Refund_Payment, sign BankTransferAuthorization is required. 
For Issue_Confirmation_Letter: RefundConfirmationPDF.

Perhaps "decision points" sometimes are the ones that require risk organ/small decisions. 
Which are decision points from process? The high-value branch is a clear decision point, where action "Senior_Auditor_Review" is only triggered if claim is > €1000. That is clearly a branch condition.
What about the triage agent's validation of eligibility - is that considered a "decision point"? If it says "validate eligibility", it suggests that they check if claim is valid or not. But perhaps no "decision" if eligibility? It might be that the decision is whether the claim is valid. Not explicit in text though. But the process is: "validate eligibility" meaning if eligible, then finance controller pre-approve happens, if not eligible then maybe process is terminated. So we consider it a decision point. But the question says "Summarise every decision point". 
I must consider that there is more clearly a branch condition: threshold for high-value. 
Another "approval" is the Finance_Controller's pre-approve which is a decision gate. However, it's not described as a "branch condition" but rather as a prerequisite. Maybe they mention that "Process Refund Payment may begin only after Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded" that is a decision point in concept: the finance controller decisions if eligible, else stop.

I check below: "these job roles are used below:" Actually process does not provide any explicit yes/no outcomes aside from the branch for high-value claims. But then then constraint says: "Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded" so implicitly if it did not succeed, then payment process is not allowed. So that is another decision point.

I then check if "Issue_Confirmation_Letter" can be considered a decision point? It is not; it is a notification.

Thus the process contains decisions:
1. Triage agent's validation decision (decision on eligibility against FlightManifest and WeatherReport) - I can guess outcome: valid or invalid. 
2. Finance_Controller's pre-approval sign-off decision (decision using EligibilityChecklist) - leads to further action or being rejected.
3. Determination of claim's high-value status relative to €1,000 threshold - requires additional Senior Auditor Review if greater than €1,000. 
4. Execution of Payment: not a decision point per se but a post decision point permission check - But in description, only decision is whether Finance_Controller and Senior Auditor conditions are met.

Wait the question says "list all required documents" so I'll list:
- RefundRequestForm (submitted by customer)
- FlightManifest (for triage agent validation)
- WeatherReport (for triage agent validation)
- EligibilityChecklist (used for finance controller pre-approval)
- AuditTrail (for Senior Auditor Review, if high-value claim)
- BankTransferAuthorization (for Process Refund Payment)
- RefundConfirmationPDF (sent to passenger)

I must not introduce any not defined.

Also, the summary of decision points must mention that:
- Triage agent validation checks the passenger's refund claim against both the flight manifest and weather report. Implicitly the agent must decide if the claim is eligible.
- Then the Finance Controller's pre-approval with Eligibility Checklist is needed.
- Finally, a conditional step: if the refund amount exceeds €1,000, the Senior Auditor Review (which includes an AuditTrail) must be performed before proceeding.
- And a final step: the refund payment ( Finance execution) requires conditions to be met, and the refund confirmation letter is sent to the passenger via a PDF once payment is executed.

I need to "summarize every decision point" carefully and "list all required documents" clearly. I'll create a structured answer:
I can structure answer with headings: Decision Points and Required Documents.
I must not include any artefacts not defined.

I must check: are there explicit decision or branching conditions? The process is described as a sequence of activities, I must identify decision points:
(1) When triage agent validates eligibility: (decision: pass/fail of claim) then if claim eligible, proceed otherwise, possibly termination of the process? But if claim is not eligible, presumably process is aborted.

(2) The Finance Controller must pre-approve: this likely includes a sign-off decision on whether the claim is approved. But the text does not explicitly say that it is a branch decision. But the constraint says "Process_Refund_Payment may begin only after Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded", so that is a branching gate that if pre-approval has not succeeded then payment does not happen. So I'll mention that as well.

(3) A conditional branch: if refund amount is > €1,000 then initiate Senior Auditor Review. That is a decision.

(4) Possibly check that BankTransferAuthorization is signed and required before refund payment. But that is not a decision point per se, that is a required document that must be acquired prior to payment execution. It is then a required condition for Process_Refund_Payment to begin.

I know that the "Decision points" in terms for a process often are the steps where a decision is made to affect the flow. There are decision points: Eligibility validation, pre-approval, threshold check, then triggering review if high-value, etc.

I can now prepare the answer.

I'll produce final answer maybe in plain text.

I'll begin: "Summary of decision points in Contoso's flight refund process and list of required documents."

I'll include such things as bullet points. I'll re-read instructions: "Do not introduce any activities or artefacts that are not defined above." That means I must adhere strictly to what's provided. For example, in the process description "refunder"? Actually, I must check that I must not include anything regarding "customer service agent decide", which is not included. So I must not mention that.

I can confirm that the step names provided: 
- Customer_Submit_Claim: uses RefundRequestForm.
- Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility: uses FlightManifest and WeatherReport.
- Finance_Controller_PreApprove: uses EligibilityChecklist.
- Senior_Auditor_Review: uses AuditTrail.
- Process_Refund_Payment: uses BankTransferAuthorization.
- Issue_Confirmation_Letter: uses RefundConfirmationPDF.

All required labels: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF.

So I'll list those correctly.

I might also mention details of decision points: They involve determining eligibility for the refund at two levels: initial validation and financial pre-approval for valid claims; and completing an extra review if refund surpasses or equals a defined monetary threshold.

I'll take some care to say that the triage agent's validation decisions are implicitly informed by FlightManifest and WeatherReport. I can say: 
"Assessing eligibility involves evaluating the claim's adherence to the FlightManifest and WeatherReport. A negative result would halt the process, whereas a positive outcome allows the process to proceed."

Then: "Finance Controller's pre-approval" basically is a decision flag that must be achieved before process refund payment execution and also requires the EligibilityChecklist. So that is a decision juncture.

Then: "The process includes a conditional branch: for claims exceeding €1,000 (i.e., high-value refunds), the additional decision of having the Senior Auditor's Review is mandated, with the AuditTrail being a required artefact. Specifically, for claims above €1,000, a Senior Auditor Review is performed, which is a decision to verify the high-value refund. If the claim is not high-value (i.e., not exceeding €1,000), this step is bypassed."

So that's all.

I must produce an answer text that summarizes each decision point and then list required documents. I'll produce answer with text summary. Remember instructions "do not introduce any activities and document not defined."

I'll produce answer in plain text. Noting the major decision points: Triage Agent decision (eligibility check), Finance Controller decision (pre-approval) and the high value branch decision. I also might indicate that "Process_Refund_Payment" activity is dependent on previous decision points.

I must check if "the Finance_Controller_PreApprove" decision point is not optional in question. But I'll say it explicitly because question asks "summarise every decision point" so I should list these ones.

I'll compile final answer.

I'll mention bullet points maybe:

Summary:

1. Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility Decision: The triage agent verifies the refund claim's validity by referencing the FlightManifest and WeatherReport. This decision determines whether the claim is eligible for further processing.

2. Finance_Controller_PreApprove Decision: The finance controller evaluates the claim using an EligibilityChecklist. This decision confirms or denies pre-approval of the claim. Payment may only initiate following this successful decision.

3. High-Value Claim Decision Branch (Senior_Auditor_Review): If the refund amount exceeds €1,000, a secondary decision point is triggered requiring a Senior Auditor to review the claim, ensuring the necessary AuditTrail is included. Claims not exceeding €1,000 bypass this step.
 
These decision points collectively determine next steps in the overall flow.

Documents Required:

- RefundRequestForm: Initiated by the customer during claim submission.
- FlightManifest & WeatherReport: Utilized during the Triage Agent's Eligibility check.
- EligibilityChecklist: Used by the finance controller during pre-approval.
- AuditTrail: Required for the Senior Auditor Review in high-value claims (refunds > €1,000).
- BankTransferAuthorization: Signed authorization needed for processing the refund payment.
- RefundConfirmationPDF: Issued to the passenger upon completion of payment, confirming refund.

I will now produce answer.Contoso’s flight-refund process includes decision points that govern the flow of a claim, as well as specific documents that must be present at each stage. Here’s a summary:

Decision Points:
• Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility – At this stage the agent reviews the submitted claim using the FlightManifest and WeatherReport. This check effectively makes a decision on whether the claim is eligible overall (if it meets the necessary conditions, the process continues; otherwise, it is rejected at this point).

• Finance_Controller_PreApprove – Next, the finance controller reviews the claim using an EligibilityChecklist. Approval at this point is a prerequisite for further processing: only if pre-approval is successful can the process move on. In effect, this step is a decision point where leave is given (or not) to proceed toward payment processing.

• High-Value Claim Branch (Senior_Auditor_Review) – This is a conditional decision: if the refund amount is greater than €1,000, the process branches off to require a Senior Auditor’s review (which must incorporate the AuditTrail). In other words, for high-value claims the refund must undergo an extra review—serving as an additional decision point—to ensure extra oversight. Claims with amounts not exceeding €1,000 bypass this step.

Required Documents:
• On Customer submission:  
  – RefundRequestForm

• For initial eligibility validation:  
  – FlightManifest  
  – WeatherReport

• For finance controller pre-approval:  
  – EligibilityChecklist

• For high-value claims (refund > €1,000):  
  – AuditTrail  
   (This is used during the Senior_Auditor_Review process.)

• Before processing payment:  
  – BankTransferAuthorization

• Upon finalizing the case:  
  – RefundConfirmationPDF

No activities or documents beyond those listed above appear in the process.
