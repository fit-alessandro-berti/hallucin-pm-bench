- Small, non-representative sample: only 18 events across 4 cases from a single short time window; not enough volume or diversity to reflect a whole month.
- Temporal sampling bias: all events occur on one day (2025-05-01), so daily/weekly patterns, seasonality, or campaign effects across the month are not captured.
