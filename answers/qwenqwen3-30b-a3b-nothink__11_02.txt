To: COO, Acme Insurance  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  

The three worst-performing activities in the Claims Handling process are:  

1. **Request Documents** – High wait time (150 min), low throughput (190/day), and high rework (22%).  
   *Action*: Implement an automated document request system to reduce manual delays and errors.  

2. **Review Documents** – Low throughput (185/day), long processing time (25 min), and high SLA breach (12.4%).  
   *Action*: Allocate additional resources or train staff to expedite document review.  

3. **Initial Assessment** – Moderate throughput (270/day), but high SLA breach (3.2%) and rework (1.8%).  
   *Action*: Standardize assessment protocols to reduce variability and rework.  

These actions target root causes identified in the data to improve efficiency and compliance.
