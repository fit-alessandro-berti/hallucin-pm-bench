2) Because this excerpt covers only three CaseIDs (1001, 1002, 1003) on a single day (March 1), it may not reflect the full month. There is only one line with "Manual Fraud Check" in this snippet, but across a longer log there could be many more, or none at all. The sample is not random or representative: events are clustered by case and time, so the observed proportion will be biased by which cases appear here. Additionally, other fraud checks (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check") exist and may substitute for manual checks in the broader data. Relying on this snippet alone risks underestimating or overestimating the true prevalence.
