In case C003, the activity `Validate_Payment` (line 6) occurs before `Receive_Order` (line 7), which contradicts the claim that `Validate_Payment` always *follows* `Receive_Order`. Additionally, in case C005, `Validate_Payment` (line 11) occurs without any preceding `Receive_Order` activity at all within that case.
