Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before **T3** in a reachable marking. Here is a shortest firing sequence:

**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

**Explanation of the sequence:**

1. **T1** fires: consumes `p0` (initial token), produces tokens in `pa` and `pb`.  
2. **T2b** fires: consumes `pa`, produces `pd` (bypassing `pc` and T3).  
3. **T4** fires: consumes `pb`, produces `pe`.  
4. **T5** fires: consumes `pd` and `pe`, produces `pf`.  

At this point, **T5** has fired, but **T3** (which requires `pc`) has not yet fired because `pc` remains unmarked. Thus, the ordering **T5 before T3** is achieved. 

This sequence is minimal and satisfies the dependency constraints of the net.
