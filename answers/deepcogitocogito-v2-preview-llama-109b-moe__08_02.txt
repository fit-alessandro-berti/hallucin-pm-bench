Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the Petri net PN-8 has an initial marking M0 with one token in P0. The transitions are T1 through T7. The question is whether T5 can fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

First, I need to trace the possible firing sequences. Starting with M0, only T1 can fire because it has the token in P0. Firing T1 puts tokens in P1 and P2. Now, from here, there are two possible paths: one from P1 leading to P3 via T2, and then to P4 via T7, and the other from P2 leading to P4 via T3. Alternatively, P2 could also lead to P6 if T5 fires with P5, but P5 isn't marked yet.

Wait, for T5 to fire, it needs tokens in both P2 and P5. P2 gets a token from T1, but P5 needs a token from P4. So, T5 can only fire after T4 fires, which requires T3 or T7 to fire first. But if T3 fires, it puts a token in P4, then T4 can fire, giving a token to P5. Then T5 can fire. But if T7 fires first from P3, T4 still needs P4, so same thing.

So, the order would be T1 -> T2/T3 -> T7/T4 -> T4 -> T5. But T5 requires both P2 and P5. Since P2 is already marked after T1, but P5 is only marked after T4. So, T5 can't fire before T3 because T3 is needed to mark P4, which then allows T4 to mark P5, enabling T5. Therefore, T5 must fire after T3.

Wait, but what if there's another path? Let me check again. T1 fires first, putting tokens in P1 and P2. Then, if T2 fires, it puts a token in P3, which then can go to P4 via T7. Meanwhile, P2 still has a token. So, T3 could fire from P2 to P4, then T4 fires, putting a token in P5. Then T5 can fire. Alternatively, if T7 fires first, T4 still needs P4. So, regardless, T3 (or T7) must fire before T4, and thus before T5. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3.
**Question 1.** No

**Question 2.** T5 cannot fire before T3 because T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5, while T3 produces a token in P4 which is needed to mark P5 (via T4). Since P2 gets its token directly from T1, but P5 requires P4 to be marked first (through either T3 or T7), T5 must wait for T3 (or T7) to fire before it can enable. Therefore, no firing sequence exists where T5 fires before T3.
