**Response**

I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95 % confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" from the information provided.

**Reason:** Artefact A (the event log) contains only the column headers; all rows—including every timestamp value in the `start_time` and `complete_time` columns—have been redacted for privacy. Cycle time for an activity is derived by calculating the difference between `complete_time` and `start_time` for each occurrence of that activity, then aggregating those durations. Without access to any actual timestamp data, it is impossible to perform this calculation. Artefact B supplies only a corporate SLA target and a historical average *throughput* time between two different activities ("Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice" ≈ 7.8 days), which does not describe the internal cycle time of "Approve Invoice" itself. Therefore, no exact metric can be computed from the supplied artefacts.
