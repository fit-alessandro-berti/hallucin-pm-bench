**Justification based on ruleset R violations:**

- **Rule 3 violation:** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) is complete. The trace shows NA (`Notify_Authorities`) happening after QE (`Quality_Engineer_Review`) but before RA (`Regulatory_Affairs_Review`), meaning NA does not occur "until after" both QE and RA are complete. Specifically, when NA is performed, RA has not yet occurred, violating the requirement that NA must not happen until both QE and RA are finalized.

- All other rules are satisfied:  
  - Rule 1: QE occurs before RA (QE first, then RA in sequence).  
  - Rule 2: VP (`VP_Safety_Approval`) occurs after both QE and RA are complete, as severity is "High" and VP is last before Close_Case.  
  - Rule 4: Close_Case (CC) only occurs after NA and VP (if required), which is met here.
