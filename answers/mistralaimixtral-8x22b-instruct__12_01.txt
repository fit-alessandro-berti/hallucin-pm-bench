The fact is **not accurate** based on the provided event-log fragment. Here’s the justification:

- **Case 1001**: The sequence is `Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued`. Here, **“Update_Inventory” occurs before “Authorize_Refund”**, contradicting the claim.
- **Case 1002**: The sequence is `Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued`. **“Authorize_Refund” occurs before “Refund_Issued”**, but there is no “Update_Inventory” in this case.
- **Case 1003**: The sequence is `Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund`. Again, **“Update_Inventory” occurs before “Authorize_Refund”**.

In **all cases where both activities appear (1001 and 1003)**, “Update_Inventory” precedes “Authorize_Refund,” directly refuting the claim. The data are sufficient to disprove the statement.
