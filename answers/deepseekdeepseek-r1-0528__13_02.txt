### Answers:

1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** (only in case C05).  

2. Percentages:  
   a) **Events**: \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 = 2.08\% \)  
   b) **Unique cases**: \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 = 8.33\% \)  

3. **Explanation**:  
   A low-support activity (e.g., 1 occurrence in 48 events) lacks statistical significance. Performance metrics (e.g., average duration) become skewed by outliers, while predictive models overfit to noise or miss true patterns. Generalizing from this slice risks inaccurate conclusions about fraud-check efficiency or resource needs.
