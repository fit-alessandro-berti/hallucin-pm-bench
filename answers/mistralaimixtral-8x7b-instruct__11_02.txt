Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Process Performance Analytics

Dear COO,

The three worst-performing activities in our Claims Handling process are Request\_Documents, Review\_Documents, and Initial\_Assessment. These activities have high average wait times, processing times, and rework rates, leading to SLA breaches.

1. Request\_Documents: With an average wait time of 150 minutes, this activity suffers from significant queueing. Its high rework rate (22%) and variability in processing time (1 minute) contribute to this issue.

Recommendation: Implement an automated document request system to streamline the process and reduce wait times, rework, and variability.

2. Review\_Documents: This activity has a high average wait time (30 minutes), processing time (25 minutes), and rework rate (5.3%). These factors lead to a significant SLA breach percentage (12.4%).

Recommendation: Cross-train staff to handle document reviews, reducing the rework rate and processing time.

3. Initial\_Assessment: This activity has a high average wait time (18 minutes) and a significant rework rate (1.8%), leading to SLA breaches.

Recommendation: Invest in an AI-based initial assessment tool to improve accuracy and reduce rework rates, thereby lowering SLA breaches.
