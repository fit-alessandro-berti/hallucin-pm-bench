**Yes**. Transition T5 can fire before transition T3 in some reachable marking.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking is:

1. Start from initial marking \(M_0\): (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)  
   Fire T1 (p0 → p1 + p2): marking becomes \(M_1\) (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)

2. From \(M_1\), fire T2 (p1 → p3): marking becomes \(M_2\) (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)

3. From \(M_2\), fire T5 (p3 –|p4 → p6, enabled because p3 has 1 token and p4 has 0 tokens, satisfying the inhibitor arc condition): marking becomes (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)

In \(M_2\) before firing T5, T3 is enabled (p2 has 1 token). Since T3 has not fired yet, this demonstrates that T5 can fire before T3.

**Justification**: T5 requires that p4 has zero tokens (due to the inhibitor arc). Since p4 is only produced by T3, keeping p4 empty allows T5 to be enabled based on the state after T2, before T3 is fired. T3 enables p3 for T5, but T2 can be fired independently to set up this condition.
