Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Key Bottlenecks & Fixes

Dashboard data single out three clear under-performers:

1. Request_Documents  
   • Longest queue (150 min) and highest rework rate (22 %) drive 5.5 % SLA breaches.  
   Action: Introduce claim-type–specific document checklists with automatic completeness validation at upload; preventing repeat requests attacks the full 22 % rework loop and should shorten the queue drastically.

2. Review_Documents  
   • Slowest activity (25 min average, ±9 min SD) and worst SLA record (12.4 %).  
   Action: Create a fast-track lane for “low-page-count” files and route them to junior reviewers; separating simple from complex cases will cut both average processing time and its variability.

3. Initial_Assessment  
   • 18 min average wait plus 12 min processing yields the third-highest breach rate (3.2 %), despite throughput almost matching Registration.  
   Action: Reallocate one assessor FTE from Check_Coverage (only 4 min wait) to this step to balance capacity and absorb the queue.

Addressing these three activities should eliminate the bulk of current SLA violations without major process redesign.
