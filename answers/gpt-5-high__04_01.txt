Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 violated: Expedite_Flag is present (#4), so Risk_Assessment must occur before the first Ship_Goods. Ship_Goods occurs at #8, but Risk_Assessment is at #9 (after), violating the precedence.
2. Rule 3 violated: After Goods_Received (#6), Three_way_match must be within the next two activities (#7 or #8). It occurs at #10 (distance 4), exceeding the allowed ≤ 2.

For completeness:
3. Rule 1 satisfied: PO = €12,300; approvals by Procurement Officer (#2) then CFO (#3) occur before Issue_PO (#5).
4. Rule 4 satisfied: No Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity (CFO at #3 is followed by System at #4).
5. Rule 5 satisfied: The trace ends with Archive_Record (#11) and nothing follows it.
