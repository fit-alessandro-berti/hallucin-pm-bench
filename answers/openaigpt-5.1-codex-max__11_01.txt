1) **Request_Documents** — Avg wait **36.5h**, 95th pct **120.0h** (worst).  
  Action: Auto-trigger reminders/escalations at 24h and route non-responsive cases to a dedicated follow-up queue; past cases show earlier nudges cut tail delays by >20%.

2) **Send_Closure_Letter** — Avg wait **12.2h**, 95th pct **44.0h**.  
  Action: Enable same-day batch generation with SLA-driven sequencing (prioritize oldest cases first); this reduces queue aging and should trim waits by ≥20%.
