**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** Orion Credit COO  
**From:** Orion Credit Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Subject:** Critical Process Bottlenecks in Loan Application Workflow  

Analysis of workflow data reveals the three worst-performing activities, identified jointly by highest SLA breaches (Avg_Throughput_Time exceeding Target_SLA) and elevated Avg_Waiting_Time: Legal Approval (900s throughput vs. 600s SLA; 600s wait), Risk Review (600s throughput vs. 300s SLA; 480s wait), and Credit Assessment (300s throughput vs. 240s SLA; 200s wait).  

Legal Approval breaches SLA by 300s (50% over), with 600s waiting on 465 cases. Risk Review breaches by 300s (100% over), with 480s waiting on 480 cases. Credit Assessment breaches by 60s (25% over), with 200s waiting on 1175 cases.  

These bottlenecks drive delays across 455 total disbursements.  

**Recommendations:**  
• Legal Approval: Allocate additional staff to cut 600s waiting time, targeting 465 pending cases for faster processing.  
• Risk Review: Automate initial checks to slash 480s waiting on 480 high-volume cases.  
• Credit Assessment: Parallelize reviews to reduce 200s waiting across 1175 cases within 240s SLA.
