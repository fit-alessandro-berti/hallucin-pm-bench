Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

Here's a shortest firing sequence demonstrating this:

1. **T1**:  p0 -> pa, pb
2. **T4**:  pb -> pe
3. **T2b**: pa -> pd
4. **T5**:  pd, pe -> pf
5. **T6**: pf -> pc
6. **T3**: pc -> pd

**Explanation:**

*   Initially, only p0 has a token.
*   T1 fires, creating tokens in pa and pb.
*   T4 fires, consuming the token from pb and creating a token in pe.
*   T2b fires, consuming the token from pa and creating a token in pd.
*   T5 can now fire (since pd and pe both have tokens) producing a token in pf.
*   T6 fires taking token from pf and puts it into pc.
*   T3 can now fire once the token has arrived at pc.

This sequence demonstrates that T5 can, indeed, fire before T3 under the given initial marking and net structure.
