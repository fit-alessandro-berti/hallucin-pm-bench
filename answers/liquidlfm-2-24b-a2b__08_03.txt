Let's analyze the Petri net step by step.

### **Initial Marking**
- p0 = 1
- All other places (pa, pb, pc, pd, pe, pf) = 0

### **Transitions**
- **T1:** p0 → pa, pb
- **T2:** pa → pc
- **T2b:** pa → pd
- **T3:** pc → pd
- **T4:** pb → pe
- **T5:** pd & pe → pf
- **T6:** pf → pc

### **Can T5 fire before T3?**

Let's see what's required for T5 to fire:
- **T5** requires **both** pc and pe to be marked.

Let's trace possible firing sequences.

#### **Path 1: p0 → T1 → T2 → pc → T3 → pd → T5**
- T1: p0=1 → pa=1, pb=1
- T2: pa=1 → pc=1
- T3: pc=1 → pd=1
- Now, pd=1, but pe=0 (not yet fired), so T5 cannot fire yet.
- To get pe, we need to fire T4: pb=1 → pe=1
- But pb is still 1 (from T1), so we can fire T4: pb=1 → pe=1
- Now, pc=1, pe=1, so T5 can fire: pc=1, pe=1 → pf=1

But in this sequence, T3 fires before T5.

#### **Can we get pe before pc?**
- The only way to get pe is via T4, which requires pb.
- pb is only produced by T1.
- So, after T1, pb=1, and we can fire T4: pb=1 → pe=1
- But pc is produced by T2, which requires pa.
- pa is produced by T1.
- So, after T1, pa=1, we can fire T2: pa=1 → pc=1
- So, **pc** is produced before **pe** in any sequence.

#### **Conclusion**
- **pc** is always produced before **pe** in any reachable marking.
- Therefore, **T5** (which requires pc and pe) can **never** fire before **T3** (which produces pc).

### **Final Answer**
**No**, it is **not possible** for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3** in any reachable marking.

**Reason:**  
The firing of **T3** produces **pd**, which is required for **T5**. However, **T5** also requires **pe**, which can only be produced by **T4**, which requires **pb** (produced by **T1**). But **T2** (which also uses **pa**) produces **pc** before **T4** can produce **pe**. Since **pc** is always produced before **pe**, **T5** cannot fire before **T3**.

**Shortest firing sequence for T5:**  
- p0 → T1 → T2 → pc → T3 → pd → T4 → pe → T5 → pf → T6 → pc

But **T3** fires before **T5** in this sequence.

**Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.**
