**Answer 1:** No.

**Answer 2:**  
For T5 to fire, it requires tokens in both P2 and P5.  
- A token in P5 requires T4 to fire, which requires a token in P4.  
- A token in P4 requires *either* T3 (which consumes P2) or the sequence T2 then T7 (which requires P1).  

However, the only way to get the initial P2 token (from T1) is to also get a P1 token. If we try to use the T2→T7 path to P4 to eventually enable T5, we still need the original P2 token for T5. But this P2 token would be consumed by T3 if it fires to create P4. Since T3 and T5 both need P2, and T5 needs P4 (which depends on T3 or T2→T7), the P2 token is always consumed before T5 can fire.
