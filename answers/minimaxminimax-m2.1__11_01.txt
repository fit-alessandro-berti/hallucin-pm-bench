**EXECUTIVE MEMO: Priority Waiting-Time Reduction Initiatives**

**TO:** Chief Operating Officer, Orion Insurance
**FROM:** Senior Process Mining Analyst
**DATE:** June 2025
**SUBJECT:** Three Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time

**1. Request_Documents (Avg: 36.5h, 95p: 120.0h)**
Implement a digital self-service portal with automated follow-up reminders. This will reduce customer response time by enabling instant uploads and preventing forgotten requests—projected 22% reduction.

**2. Send_Closure_Letter (Avg: 12.2h, 95p: 44.0h)**
Deploy automated template-based letter generation triggered by claim status changes, eliminating manual drafting and scheduling delays—projected 25% reduction.

**3. Assess_Liability (Avg: 7.8h, 95p: 16.4h)**
Establish a pre-approved vendor panel with standardized decision protocols to accelerate specialist assignment and reduce case routing variability—projected 20% reduction.

All recommendations target the 20%+ threshold and focus exclusively on reducing waiting times.
