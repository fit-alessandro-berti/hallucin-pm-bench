**No**

The fact is inaccurate. Case C003 shows Validate_Payment (line 6) occurring at 10:43:00Z, which is **before** Receive_Order (line 7) at 10:45:00Z. Additionally, case C005 has Validate_Payment (line 11) with no subsequent Receive_Order event in the log, meaning Validate_Payment does not follow Receive_Order in that case either. The claim that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order is contradicted by these counterexamples.
