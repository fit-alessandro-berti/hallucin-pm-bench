1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs exactly once in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the overall frequency of manual fraud checks because the excerpt covers only a tiny portion of the full month's data. Patterns or unique cases observed here may not reflect the actual distribution across the entire month. For instance, manual checks may be disproportionately represented due to sampling coincidence. Without the full log, the analyst lacks sufficient context to determine if the manual fraud check shown is common or an outlier. Thus, limited visibility potentially causes an inaccurate estimation of how frequently manual fraud checks actually occur in the complete month-long dataset.
