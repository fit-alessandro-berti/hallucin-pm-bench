2️⃣ This excerpt covers only three cases on a single day (March 1, 2025), representing a tiny fraction of a full month-long log. With just one "Manual Fraud Check" across these cases, an analyst might underestimate its frequency if later cases or days show more manual interventions. Conversely, the snippet's focus on early-morning events could overrepresent automated processes (e.g., two automatic fraud checks), skewing perceptions of manual checks' rarity in the broader dataset. Small sample size limits generalizability to the entire log's patterns. (78 words)
