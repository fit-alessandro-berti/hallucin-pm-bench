**No.**

The event-log does not support the claim that "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order" without any other activities in between across all relevant CaseIDs. While **C003** shows "Validate_Payment" immediately following "Receive_Order" (CaseID C003, repeating CaseID C001 in structure), **C004** demonstrates a deviation:  
- "Receive_Order" (CaseID C004) is followed by "Check_Fraud" (C004,10:07), then "Validate_Payment" (C004,10:20), skipping an activity entirely ("Pack_Items" or the same order handling).  

Since there is at least one case where "Validate_Payment" is not immediately after "Receive_Order", the fact is inaccurate.
