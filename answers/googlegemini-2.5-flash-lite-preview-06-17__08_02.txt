**Answer to Question 1:**

No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Answer to Question 2:**

Transition T3 enables transition T7 (indirectly), which is a prerequisite for T5 to fire. For T5 to fire, both P2 and P5 must have tokens. P2 receives a token when T1 fires. P5 receives a token when T4 fires. T4 requires P4, which is enabled by either T2 (after T1 fires and P1 enables T2) or T3. Therefore, T3 must fire (or contribute to enabling T4 by firing T7) before T5 can be enabled and potentially fire. P4 is a common post-condition of T2 and T3, and P5 depends on P4 firing T4. Thus, T3 must occur before T5.
