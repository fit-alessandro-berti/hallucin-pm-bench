1. **Manual_Fraud_Check** appears **once** in the excerpt.

2. **Percentage of events**  
   \( \frac{1}{48}\times100 = 2.0833\% \) → **2.08 %**  
   **Percentage of unique cases** (12 total)  
   \( \frac{1}{12}\times100 = 8.3333\% \) → **8.33 %**

3. The single instance of **Manual_Fraud_Check** appears only once in 48 events and in one of the 12 cases. Because it is so rare, any statistic that aggregates it (e.g., average resolution time, throughput, or predictive probability of approval) will be dominated by a single data point, which can inflate or deflate the metric. In predictive models, the activity may be treated as an outlier or its effect may be hidden, leading to under‑estimation of risk or resource needs when the full log is examined.
