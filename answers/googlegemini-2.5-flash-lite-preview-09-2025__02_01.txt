    *   Validate\_Order (08:16:00)
    *   Pack\_Items (09:01:00)
    *   Ship\_Order (09:20:00)
3.  **Trace Case B-1045:**
    *   Receive\_Order (08:05:00)
    *   Validate\_Order (08:17:00)
    *   Quality\_Check (08:45:00)
    *   Pack\_Items (09:10:00)
    *   Ship\_Order (09:25:00)
4.  **Trace Case C-77:**
    *   Quality\_Check (10:00:00)

Answering Questions:

**Q1. How many distinct case IDs appear in the fragment?**
Distinct IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77. Count = 3.

**Q2. Which activity immediately precedes `"Ship_Order"` in case A-9321?**
In A-9321, the sequence is `... -> Pack_Items -> Ship_Order`. The preceding activity is "Pack\_Items".

**Q3. What is the earliest timestamp in the fragment (ISO-8601 format)?**
Timestamps present: 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T08:17:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T09:10:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T09:25:00.000+00:00, 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00.
The earliest is "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00".

**Q4. How many times does the activity `"Quality_Check"` occur?**
Occurrences: Once in B-1045, once in C-77. Total = 2.

**Q5. List every activity that never appears as the first event of any case.**
First events:
Case A-9321: Receive\_Order
Case B-1045: Receive\_Order
Case C-77: Quality\_Check
All distinct activities: Receive\_Order, Validate\_Order, Pack\_Items, Ship\_Order, Quality\_Check.
Activities that appear as first events: Receive\_Order, Quality\_Check.
Activities that *never* appear as first events: Validate\_Order, Pack\_Items, Ship\_Order.
