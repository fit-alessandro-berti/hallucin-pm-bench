To bring the “FastClaimOnboarding” process into SLA without adding new activities, introduce a timer intermediate catching event after the **Task_Check** (ID: `Task_Check`) to auto-escalate incomplete claims.

Connect `Task_Check` to a new **intermediate timer event** (e.g., ID: `Timer_Escalate`) with a **48-hour duration**. From `Timer_Escalate`, route a **new sequence flow** (e.g., ID: `f10`) to the **Task_Triage** (ID: `Task_Triage`) and make it the default path using a **none condition**. Update the current sequence flow from `Task_Check` to `GW_Docs` (ID: `f3`) to trigger **only if documents are complete within 48 hours**, ensuring early triage. This ensures all claims auto-escalate to `Task_Triage` if not triaged within the SLA window while maintaining the original document completeness logic.
