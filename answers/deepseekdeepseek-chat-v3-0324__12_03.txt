**No**  

Justification:  
1. **Case C002** shows the sequence: `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`. Here, `Validate_Payment` does **not** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` (it is preceded by `Pack_Items`).  
2. **Case C004** shows the sequence: `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment`. Here, `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.  

Both cases violate the stated FACT. The only compliant cases are **C001** and **C003**, where `Validate_Payment` follows immediately after `Receive_Order`.
