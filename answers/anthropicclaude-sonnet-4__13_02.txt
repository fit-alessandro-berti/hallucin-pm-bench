## 3. Analysis Impact (â‰¤100 words)
This low-support activity (8.33% case frequency) creates significant analytical risks. With only one occurrence, any performance metrics derived from Manual_Fraud_Check lack statistical reliability. Predictive models trained on this data would either ignore this variant entirely or severely underestimate its importance in the actual process. The single instance provides no insight into Manual_Fraud_Check's typical duration, success patterns, or triggering conditions. Generalizing from this slice could lead to incomplete process automation rules, inaccurate cycle time predictions, and poorly designed fraud detection workflows that don't account for manual intervention scenarios.
