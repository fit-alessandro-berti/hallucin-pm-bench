The stated fact is inaccurate because Case C003 demonstrates a sequence where Validate_Payment (line 6) occurs prior to Receive_Order (line 7), directly contradicting the claim that Validate_Payment always follows. Additionally, Case C005 records Validate_Payment (line 11) without any preceding Receive_Order event in the provided fragment, further confirming that the specified order is not consistent across all cases in the log.
