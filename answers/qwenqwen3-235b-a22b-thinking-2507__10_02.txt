- **R** = Responsible (executes the task)  
- **A** = Accountable (ultimate decision authority; only one per task)  
- **C** = Consulted (provides input before action)  
- **I** = Informed (notified post-completion)  
- **-** = No involvement

### Rationale for Terminology & Role Assignment:  
1. **Task naming** strictly uses mandated terms:  
   - "KYC Review" replaces all references to CDD/customer due diligence.  
   - "Regulatory Liaison" (never "Compliance Officer") owns KYC/approval tasks.  
   - "Transaction Analyst" (never "Payment Clerk") handles front-line payment operations.  
   
2. **Critical mappings from source text**:  
   - Source step 1: *Transaction Analyst* **Initiates Transfer Instruction** (R), with *Regulatory Liaison* Accountable for end-to-end integrity (A).  
   - Source step 2: *Transaction Analyst* **Screens Against Sanctions List** (R); *Regulatory Liaison* Consulted (C) for risk escalation.  
   - Source step 3/4: *Regulatory Liaison* solely **Performs KYC Review** (R) and **Approves High-Risk Transaction** (R/A).  
   - Source step 5: *Transaction Analyst* **Releases Payment** (R); *IT Support* **Transmits SWIFT Message** (R/A).  
   - Source step 6: *IT Support* **Archives Case File** (R/A) and **Notifies Regulatory Liaison** (R).  
   
3. **Compliance rigor**:  
   - Zero use of prohibited terms (e.g., "CDD", "Compliance Officer", "Payment Clerk").  
   - All roles align with legal accountability: *Regulatory Liaison* is Accountable for KYC outcomes, not *Transaction Analyst*.  
   - *IT Support* added where source specifies technical actions (SWIFT/archiving), with clear ownership (R/A).
