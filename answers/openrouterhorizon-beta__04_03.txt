No

- Rule 1: Violated. QE and RA must occur once each and in that order; here RA occurs after NA, and QE appears before RA but NA intervenes; still, the rule requires QE then RA consecutively? It says in that order, not necessarily consecutiveâ€”however RA does occur after QE, so Rule 1 is satisfied regarding order and once each. 
- Rule 2: Satisfied. Severity is High, and VP occurs after both QE and RA.
- Rule 3: Violated. NA occurs before RA; NA must not occur until after both QE and RA are complete.
- Rule 4: Satisfied. CC occurs after NA and after VP (required due to High severity).
