No

Justification (by rule):

1. Violated – QE occurs, but RA happens only after Notify_Authorities (i.e., QE and RA do not occur in that order; RA is second-last instead of immediately after QE).
2. Satisfied – Severity is "High", VP does occur, and it is after both QE and RA (VP is the last activity before Close_Case).
3. Violated – NA occurs immediately after QE, before RA is complete (RA is still missing at that point, so NA happens before both QE and RA are finished).
4. Satisfied – CC is the final activity and occurs after NA and after the required VP.

The trace is non-compliant because it violates rules 1 and 3.
