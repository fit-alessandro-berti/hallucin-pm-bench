The log contains at least two cases where *Validate_Payment* does not directly follow *Receive_Order*: case C003’s *Validate_Payment* appears at line 6 without any prior *Receive_Order* in that trace, and case C005’s *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 11 before its only *Receive_Order* (which never appears). Consequently, the activity *Validate_Payment* is not guaranteed to follow *Receive_Order* in every instance of the fragment.
