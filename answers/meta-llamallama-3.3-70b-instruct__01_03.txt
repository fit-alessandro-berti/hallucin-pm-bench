**a) Decision points:**

1. The process has a conditional branch after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, where if the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is ≤ €250,000, step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review) is skipped.
2. The Decision-Gate "TriVote" requires approvals from at least two out of three officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) to pass.

**b) Documents required in the process, in the order they first appear:**

1. **Form 14B** ( Receive-Application)
2. **Scorecard–Cyan**, **Scorecard–Magenta**, **Scorecard–Yellow** (Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
3. **Deck Memo** (Manual-Underwriting-Review)
4. **Offer Sheet 77** (Prepare-Binding-Offer)
5. **ID Matrix Declaration** (Request-Applicant-Confirmation)
6. **Loan Dossier 2025** (Finalize-Agreement) 

Note that the Scorecards are not traditional documents like the others but are included as they are specific inputs required for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check step.
