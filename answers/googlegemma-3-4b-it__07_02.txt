Here's a summary of the changes between the two BPMN XML versions of Acme Bank’s *Loan_Process*, grouped as requested:

**• Added tasks**

*   `Task_VerifyIdentity`: Added a task to verify the applicant’s identity.
*   `Task_RequestDocs`: Added a task to request additional documents from the applicant.
*   `Task_FinalReject`: Added a task to handle final loan rejections.
*   `Task_Auto-Approve Loan`: Added a task to automatically approve the loan.

**• Removed tasks**

*   `Task_RejectLoan`: Removed the task dedicated to rejecting the loan.  Its functionality has been incorporated into a final rejection task.

**• Gateway-type changes (e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)**

*   `ExclusiveGateway` changed to `InclusiveGateway`: The gateway named “Eligible?” was replaced with an inclusive gateway, reflecting a more nuanced decision-making process where multiple conditions can lead to either approval or eliciting further action (requesting documents or rejecting). The flow names were also changed to reflect the new conditions ("eligible," "missing docs," "ineligible").
