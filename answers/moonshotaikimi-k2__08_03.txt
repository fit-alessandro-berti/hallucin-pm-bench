Answer  
Transition T5 can fire only when it receives one token from pd and one token from pe.  
A token in pd is obtained either:  
(1) directly from T2b, or  
(2) indirectly from T2 followed by T3.  

Likewise, a token in pe is obtained only from T4, but T4 needs pb which comes from T1.  
Therefore, whatever sequence we pick, any token that ever appears in pd has to be preceded by the firing of the pair T2·T3, so T3 must fire strictly before T5’s first enabling (there is no other path to pd).  
Hence it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3.

Formally:  
For every sequence σ leading to the enabling of T5 (i.e. a reachable marking where pd≥1), write σ in the form σ₁·T3·σ₂ where T3 is the first occurrence of T3. Then σ₁ contains the occurrence of T2 that puts the token in pc; that token is removed only by T3, so T3 appears **before** T5 in every reachable enabling sequence.
