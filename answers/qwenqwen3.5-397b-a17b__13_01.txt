1. **1**  
   (The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears exactly once, in line 7.)

2. **5.56%**  
   (Calculation: 1 occurrence ÷ 18 total events = 0.05555... → 5.56%.)

3. **A1002**  
   (This is the only case identifier associated with the "Manual_Fraud_Check" activity.)

4. **Two sampling-related reasons:**  
   *   **Limited temporal scope:** The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01) and approximately five hours. Fraud patterns often vary by day of the week, time of month, or season, so one day is not representative of a full month.  
   *   **Insufficient sample size:** The fragment contains only 4 cases. With such a small population, a single occurrence (25% of cases) creates a high variance estimate that is statistically unreliable for extrapolating monthly frequencies.
