**Non-compliant**

1. Rule 1: The purchase order exceeds €10,000, but only one approval (from the CFO) was obtained before `Issue_PO`.
2. Rule 2: The trace contains activity `Expedite_Flag`, which should make `Risk_Assessment` occur before `Ship_Goods`, but this did not happen.
3. Rule 10: `Three_way_match` was completed after `Goods_Received`, which is more than two activities away.
4. Rule 4: Activity `Move_to_Quality` executed by the role **Intern** directly follows activity `Goods_Received` executed by the role **Warehouse_Clerk**.
5. Rule 5: The trace does finish with `Archive_Record`, which is correct.
