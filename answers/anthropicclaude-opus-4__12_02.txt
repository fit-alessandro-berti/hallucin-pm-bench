The stated fact is not accurate. While Validate_Payment does follow Receive_Order in cases C001 (lines 1-2) and C002 (lines 3-5), there are two clear counterexamples that disprove the claim. In case C003, Validate_Payment occurs at 10:43:00Z (line 6) while Receive_Order happens later at 10:45:00Z (line 7), showing the reverse order. Additionally, in case C005, we only see Validate_Payment (line 11) followed by Cancel_Order (line 12), with no Receive_Order activity recorded at all for this case. These exceptions demonstrate that Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order in the log fragment.
