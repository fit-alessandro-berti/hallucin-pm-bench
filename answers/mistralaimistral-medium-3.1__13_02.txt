3.
Low-support activities like *Manual_Fraud_Check* (2.08% of events, 8.33% of cases) can mislead analyses by:
- **Overstating rarity**: The slice may underrepresent its true frequency in the full log.
- **Skewing metrics**: Performance/predictive models may misclassify it as noise, ignoring its impact (e.g., delays in *C05*).
- **Bias in sampling**: If this excerpt is atypical (e.g., mostly auto-checked claims), generalizing could hide critical manual-review patterns.
- **Ignoring context**: A single case (*C05*) shows it precedes fast approvalâ€”omitting this distorts fraud-check process variability.

*Always validate with full data.*
