Subject: High-Impact Waiting Time Reductions

Based on the last 12 months' data, the following activities exhibit the worst waiting times:

1.  **Request_Documents**: This activity has an average waiting time of **36.5 hours** and a 95th percentile of **120.0 hours**. We recommend automating document request generation and sending through a new system integration to reduce waiting by >20%.

2.  **Send_Closure_Letter**: This activity shows an average waiting time of **12.2 hours** and a 95th percentile of **44.0 hours**. Implementing an automated email trigger for closure letters upon claim resolution would significantly cut this waiting time.

3.  **Assess_Liability**: With an average waiting time of **7.8 hours** and a 95th percentile of **16.4 hours**, this activity indicates bottlenecks. Assigning a dedicated "triage" team to pre-sort and allocate liability assessment cases by complexity could reduce waiting by >20%.

These actions are data-driven and scalable to drive significant efficiency gains.
