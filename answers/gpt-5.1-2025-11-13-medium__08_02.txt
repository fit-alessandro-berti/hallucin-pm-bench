**Answer 1.** Yes, T5 can fire before T3.

**Answer 2.**  
After T1 fires, we have tokens in P1 and P2. We *postpone* T3 and move only the P1-token forward:

1. **T1:** P0 → P1, P2  
2. **T2:** P1 → P3  
3. **T7:** P3 → P4  
4. **T4:** P4 → P5  

Now the marking has tokens in **P2** and **P5**, so:

5. **T5:** {P2, P5} → P6  

T3 never fires, and T5 fires as soon as it becomes enabled, strictly before any occurrence of T3.
