Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before **T3**. 

**Concrete firing sequence**:  
1. **T1** fires: consumes `p0` (1 token), produces tokens in `p1` and `p2` (both now have 1 token).  
2. **T2** fires: consumes `p1`, produces token in `p3` (`p3 = 1`; `p2 = 1` remains).  
3. **T5** fires: consumes `p3` (now `p3 = 0`), produces token in `p6`; **inhibitor arc condition** is satisfied (`p4 = 0`), so enabled.  

At this point, **T5 has fired before T3** (which has not yet fired). After this sequence, `p2` still holds a token, allowing **T3** to fire *later* (if desired), but the key is that **T5 fires prior to any firing of T3**.  

**Proof of possibility**:  
- After **T1** and **T2**, `p3 = 1` and `p4 = 0`, which satisfies T5’s requirements (normal input from `p3` and inhibitor constraint on `p4`).  
- No rules prevent choosing **T5** over **T3** at this step, as both are enabled but independent. Thus, T5 fires first in this valid sequence.  

**Answer**: Yes.  

**Firing sequence**: T1 → T2 → T5.
