1) The average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the provided data. The event log header does not include timestamps or elapsed-time fields, as they have been redacted. Without this information, it is not possible to calculate the duration or average cycle time for any activity, including “Review Contract.”

2) No calculation was performed due to the absence of timing data in the event log. Cycle time requires start and end timestamps or duration information for each activity instance to compute an average across cases. Since this data is not available in the provided log, the value cannot be determined.
