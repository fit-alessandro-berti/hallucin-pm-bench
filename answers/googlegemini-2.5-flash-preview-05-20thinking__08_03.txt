Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3**.

One shortest firing sequence demonstrating this is:
**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

**Explanation:**
1.  **T1** fires: Token from `p0` moves to `pa` and `pb`. (Current state: `pa=1, pb=1`)
2.  **T2b** fires: Token from `pa` moves to `pd`. This is the "shortcut" path, bypassing `pc` and `T3`. (Current state: `pb=1, pd=1`)
3.  **T4** fires: Token from `pb` moves to `pe`. (Current state: `pd=1, pe=1`)
4.  At this point, `pc` has no token, so **T3** is not enabled and has not fired.
5.  **T5** fires: Tokens from `pd` and `pe` are consumed. (Current state: `pf=1`)

In this sequence, **T5** fires at step 4, while **T3** never fires. Therefore, **T5** fires *before* **T3**.
