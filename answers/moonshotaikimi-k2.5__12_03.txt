 **No**

**Justification:**

The FACT is contradicted by two cases in the log where activities intervene between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**:

*   **Case C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment`. Here, **Pack_Items** occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.
*   **Case C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment` → `Pack_Items`. Here, **Check_Fraud** occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.

Only Cases C001 and C003 show Validate_Payment occurring immediately after Receive_Order. Because the rule claims this happens “always,” the existence of C002 and C004 renders the FACT inaccurate.
