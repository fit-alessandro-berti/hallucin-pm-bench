### Decision Points in Contoso Airlines' Flight-Refund Process:
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**:  
   - Decision: Is the claim eligible based on the *FlightManifest* (e.g., flight status, booking details) and *WeatherReport* (e.g., weather-related disruptions)?  
   - *Outcome*: Eligible → Proceed to Finance_Controller_PreApprove. Not eligible → Process halts (no further steps).  

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**:  
   - Decision: Does the claim meet all requirements in the *EligibilityChecklist* (e.g., policy compliance, documentation validity)?  
   - *Outcome*: Approved → Proceed to High-value branch check. Rejected → Process halts.  

3. **High-value branch**:  
   - Decision: Is the refund amount **greater than €1,000**?  
   - *Outcome*: Yes → Proceed to *Senior_Auditor_Review*. No → Directly proceed to *Process_Refund_Payment*.
