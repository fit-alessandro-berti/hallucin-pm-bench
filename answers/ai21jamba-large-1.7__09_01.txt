 The requested values **cannot be derived**. To calculate the **average cycle time (in hours)** of an activity such as "Review Contract," we need the **duration (time spent)** for each instance of this activity, which requires **timestamps** or **elapsed time data** between events.

Since the timestamps and elapsed-time fields are **redacted**, no accurate duration calculations can be performed. Historical benchmarks provide reference values but cannot substitute for specific data in this log.
