The fact is **not accurate**.

Justification:  
- In Case 1001 and Case 1003, **"Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund"** (1001: Update_Inventory at 08:25:55, Authorize_Refund at 08:30:02; 1003: Update_Inventory at 10:08:07, Authorize_Refund at 10:22:18).  
- In Case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all.  
Therefore, "Authorize_Refund" does **not** always occur immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case.
