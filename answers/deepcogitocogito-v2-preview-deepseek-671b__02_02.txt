I need to analyze an XES event log and answer three specific questions about the data. Since I'm seeing this data for the first time, I should carefully parse the 10-line log to answer each question accurately.

First, let's look at Q1: "How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?"

To find the number of distinct cases, I need to look at the 'case' attribute in each event and count how many unique values appear. Let's list them:

Line 1: C001
Line 2: C002
Line 3: C001
Line 4: C003
Line 5: C002
Line 6: C003
Line 7: C001
Line 8: C002
Line 9: C003
Line 10: C002

The unique case IDs are C001, C002, and C003. So there are 3 distinct cases.

Now, Q2: "For case 'C002', list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use '→' as the separator)."

I need to filter all events for case C002 and list their activities in chronological order based on the timestamps. Let's find all events for C002 and order them:

Line 2: C002 - Receive_Order at 2025-03-01T09:15:10
Line 5: C002 - Check_Stock at 2025-03-01T09:22:55
Line 8: C002 - Arrange_Delivery at 2025-03-01T10:15:20
Line 10: C002 - Ship_Order at 2025-03-01T10:25:40

So the sequence is: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

Finally, Q3: "Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes 'Ship_Order' (one per line, alphabetically ordered)."

I need to look at each occurrence of the "Ship_Order" activity and identify what activity came before it in the same case. Then collect all such unique preceding activities and sort them alphabetically.

Looking at the log:
- For Case C001, before Ship_Order (Line 7) is Check_Stock (Line 3)
- For Case C002, before Ship_Order (Line 10) is Arrange_Delivery (Line 8)
- For Case C003, before Ship_Order (Line 9) is Check_Stock (Line 6)

So the preceding activities are: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock, Check_Stock. After removing duplicates and sorting alphabetically:

Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
Here are the answers to your questions:

**Q1:** There are **3** distinct cases present in this fragment.

*Cases are: C001, C002, and C003*

**Q2:** For case C002, the sequence of activities in order is:  
**Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

**Q3:** The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:  
*Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock*
