 **Decision Points**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – compares the independent risk scores (0–9) produced by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B during the **Dual Underwriter Split**.  
   • If the scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the flow proceeds to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.  
   • Otherwise, the case escalates to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision, after which the flow continues.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision** – tests the requested principal against the €15,000 ceiling.  
   • If **amount < €15,000**, the system auto-approves and the case moves toward **Disburse Funds**.  
   • If **amount ≥ €15,000**, the case is routed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – the board votes *approve* or *reject* for every application that reached this step (amounts ≥ €15,000).
