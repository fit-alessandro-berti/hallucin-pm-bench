Short answer: No, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

Reasoning:

- T5 has:
  - an input (normal) arc from p3: requires a token in p3.
  - an inhibitor arc from p4: requires p4 to have zero tokens.

- Only T2 can produce a token in p3, and T2 requires a token in p1.
- Only T1 can produce a token in p1 (and in p2).
- Thus, to get p3:
  1. T1 fires: p0 → p1 + p2, marking: p1=1, p2=1.
  2. T2 fires: p1 → p3, marking: p3=1, p2=1.

- At this point (the earliest p3 exists), p2 still has a token.
- Transition T3 is enabled (needs p2).
- Firing T3 is the ONLY way to remove that token from p2 and it moves it to p4:
  - After T3: p3=1, p4=1.

- Crucially:
  - Before T3 fires, p4=0 (good for T5) but p3 does not yet exist.
  - After T2 fires (so p3=1), p2 is still marked, and T3 is enabled.
  - However, the presence of the token in p2 does not directly affect T5’s enabling; only p3 and (absence of) p4 matter.

Check T5 enabling step-by-step:

- The earliest marking where T5 could even be considered is right after T2:
  - Marking: p3=1, p2=1, others 0.
  - T5’s conditions:
    - p3 has a token: satisfied.
    - p4 has zero tokens: satisfied (p4=0).
  - So here T5 IS enabled.

- But has T3 fired yet at this point?
  - No. We got here via T1, then T2; T3 has not fired.
  - Therefore a valid sequence is:
    - T1, T2, T5

Wait, that appears to say "yes." Why is that incorrect? Because we must include all constraints:

Look again at the net definition: it is safe, and transitions behave independently except for their pre/post/inhibitor conditions. Under standard Petri net semantics, the above sequence is actually valid:

1. Initial: p0=1.
2. Fire T1: p1=1, p2=1.
3. Fire T2: p1=0, p3=1, p2=1.
4. At this marking, T5 is enabled (p3=1, p4=0); T3 has not fired yet.
5. Fire T5: consumes p3, produces p6.
   - Result: p2=1, p6=1; p3=0, p4=0.

No rule forbids T5 from “overtaking” T3; T5 does not depend on p2, only on p3 and absence of a token in p4.

Conclusion:

- Yes, it is possible.
- One valid firing sequence where T5 fires before T3:
  - T1, T2, T5
- Brief justification:
  - After T1 then T2, we have p3=1 and p4=0; thus T5 is enabled and can fire before T3 (which uses p2→p4).
