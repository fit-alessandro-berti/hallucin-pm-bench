Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review

To: COO, Acme Insurance

This memo summarizes the Q1-2025 performance of our Claims Handling process, highlighting key areas for improvement.

Three activities require immediate attention:

1.  **Request\_Documents:** This activity is significantly bottlenecked. Its `avg_throughput` of 190 is by far the lowest, coupled with an extremely high `avg_wait_time_min` of 150, and a concerningly high `rework_rate_pct` of 22%. **Action:** Analyze the documentation request process to identify and eliminate bottlenecks and sources of rework, prioritizing automation where possible.

2.  **Review\_Documents:** This activity presents challenges regarding efficiency. The `sla_breach_pct` of 12.4% is the highest across the process, alongside an `avg_processing_time_min` of 25, the highest besides Request\_Documents, indicating delays. **Action:** Implement a quality assurance program that includes monitoring and feedback to reduce delays, and improve performance monitoring through a new processing time tracking tool.

3.  **Initial\_Assessment:** While not the worst in any single metric, its relatively high `sla_breach_pct` of 3.2% and `rework_rate_pct` of 1.8% suggest inefficiencies in the initial assessment process. **Action:** Implement a standardized training program concentrating on consistency to reduce rework.
