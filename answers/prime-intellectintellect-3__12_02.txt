No. The claim is inaccurate because case C003 violates the condition. Specifically, the Receive_Order event for C003 occurs at line 7 (10:45), but there is no subsequent Validate_Payment event for this case in the log after this point (the log ends here for C003). Additionally, while not required for the "always follows" condition, the C002 case (line 3: Receive_Order) shows Validate_Payment is not the immediate next event (line 4: Check_Inventory occurs first).
