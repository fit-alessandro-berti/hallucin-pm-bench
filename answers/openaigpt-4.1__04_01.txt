**Non-compliant**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1 (PO approval sequence) – Compliant:**  
   - `PO_Amount` = €12,300 (> €10,000); requires two approvals:
     - Approve_PO (Procurement_Officer) at #2
     - Approve_PO_CFO (CFO) at #3
     - Both occur in proper order before `Issue_PO` at #5.
   
2. **Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag conditions) – Non-compliant:**  
   - `Expedite_Flag` is present at #4.
   - Therefore, `Risk_Assessment` must occur *before* the **first** occurrence of `Ship_Goods`.
   - Here, `Ship_Goods` is at #8; `Risk_Assessment` is at #9 (i.e., **after** `Ship_Goods`).  
   - **This violates Rule 2.2.**

3. **Rule 3 (Three_way_match within 2 steps after Goods_Received) – Compliant:**
   - `Goods_Received` at #6; within next two activities are:
     - #7: Move_to_Quality
     - #8: Ship_Goods
     - `Three_way_match` is at #10—not within two steps (distance=4 from #6).  
   - However, upon re-reading, the rule says "within the next two activities"; #7 and #8 are the only window. `Three_way_match` is at #10, after #9.  
   - This is a **violation**.
   - **Thus, Rule 3 is also violated.**

4. **Rule 4 (No Intern action directly after CFO) – Compliant:**
   - The only CFO action is at #3 (`Approve_PO_CFO`), followed by `Expedite_Flag` (System). No Intern action follows directly after CFO.

5. **Rule 5 (Trace must end with Archive_Record) – Compliant:**  
   - `Archive_Record` is at #11; no events after.

---

### **Conclusion: Non-compliant.**

**Major Violations:**
- (#2) **Risk_Assessment** does **not** occur before `Ship_Goods` when `Expedite_Flag` is present (**Rule 2 violated**).
- (#3) **Three_way_match** is **not within 2 activities after `Goods_Received`** (**Rule 3 violated**).

**Compliant on:**
- Rule 1, Rule 4, Rule 5

**Summary:** At least two rules (2 and 3) are violated; trace is therefore **non-compliant** with P2P-2025.R1.
