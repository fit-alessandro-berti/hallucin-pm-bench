**Definitions:**  
- **R** = **Responsible** (the role that performs the activity)  
- **A** = **Accountable** (the role ultimately answerable for the activity – **not used explicitly in the matrix**, per user constraints)  
- **C** = **Consulted** (the role involved in decision-making or providing input – **not used explicitly in the matrix**, per user constraints)  
- **I** = **Informed** (the role notified of the activity’s outcome – **not used explicitly in the matrix**, per user constraints)  

**Notes:**  
- Roles not explicitly involved in an activity are omitted from the matrix per user constraints.  
- No synonyms or alternative phrasing for activities (e.g., *Intake Vetting*, *KYC Review*, *AML Screening*, *Risk Scoring*).
