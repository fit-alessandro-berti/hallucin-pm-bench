Our recent analysis of process data indicates that three activities are underperforming when evaluated jointly on SLA breaches and waiting times. Specifically, Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment have significant delays relative to their targets. Risk Review records an average throughput time of 600 seconds against a 300-second SLA and a waiting time of 480 seconds, representing a 300-second breach. Legal Approval similarly shows a 300-second breach with 900 seconds of throughput and an even higher waiting time of 600 seconds. Credit Assessment, with an average throughput time of 300 seconds for a 240-second target and a waiting time of 200 seconds, exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds.

Recommendations:
• Risk Review: Analyze the distribution of the 480-second waiting time over 480 cases to identify process bottlenecks causing the 300-second SLA overrun.
• Legal Approval: Reevaluate workflow steps to reduce the 600-second waiting period and align throughput with the 600-second target.
• Credit Assessment: Optimize process steps to decrease the 200-second waiting time and close the 60-second SLA gap.
