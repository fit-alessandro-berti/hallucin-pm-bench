Subject: Critical Activity Performance Review  

Analysis of process data identifies Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment as the three worst-performing activities. Legal Approval exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (900s throughput vs 600s target) with 600s average waiting time. Risk Review breaches SLA by 300 seconds (600s throughput vs 300s target), with 480s wait time. Credit Assessment exceeds the target by 60 seconds (300s throughput vs 240s), with 200s average waiting time.  

Recommendations:  
- Automate document verification for Legal Approval to address 600-second wait time.  
- Integrate real-time risk data sources to reduce Risk Review's 480-second wait time.  
- Streamline internal data collection for Credit Assessment to cut 200-second wait time.
