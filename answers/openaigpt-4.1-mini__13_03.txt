1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002 at 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).

2️⃣ An analyst viewing only this snippet may misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because the sample is small and not necessarily representative of the full month. This excerpt contains just four cases and a limited time window, which may bias activity counts. Also, activities can be recorded under slightly different but related strings (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), so if manual checks appear under variant names or in cases outside this snippet, they will be missed. Moreover, some cases show multiple activity repetitions or missing manual checks, so the snippet may not reflect typical process variants or proportions of manual fraud reviews in the overall data.
