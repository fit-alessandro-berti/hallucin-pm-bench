# EXECUTIVE MEMO

## WAITING TIME BOTTLENECKS & RECOMMENDATIONS

**TO:** Chief Operating Officer, Orion Insurance
**FROM:** Process Mining Analytics Team

Our analysis identified three critical waiting-time bottlenecks in the claims process:

**#1 REQUEST_DOCUMENTS** (worst performer)
- Average wait: 36.5 hours
- 95th percentile wait: 120.0 hours
- Recommendation: Implement automated document request system with preset reminders at 24h, 48h, and 72h intervals, reducing dependency on manual follow-ups.

**#2 SEND_CLOSURE_LETTER**
- Average wait: 12.2 hours
- 95th percentile wait: 44.0 hours
- Recommendation: Create pre-approved letter templates and automate generation upon claim decision, eliminating review delays.

**#3 ASSESS_LIABILITY**
- Average wait: 7.8 hours
- 95th percentile wait: 16.4 hours
- Recommendation: Establish clear liability assessment criteria for straightforward cases (70% of volume) and fast-track these through dedicated assessors.
