3. Explanation (≤100 words)  
A single, rare “Manual_Fraud_Check” instance gives almost no statistical basis for conclusions. Any performance metric (e.g., duration, waiting time) or predictive model based on this activity will be dominated by noise or idiosyncrasies of case C05. If we generalise from this slice, we may wrongly treat its throughput, risk, or outcome impact as typical, miscalibrate models, or overfit rules that won’t hold once more data or different populations are considered.
