The user is asking about Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process defined earlier. The user wants:

a) Summarise every decision point (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process, describing its rule in one sentence each.

b) List all documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear.

We need to provide a summary of decision points, which presumably includes:

- The condition "if (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ €250,000) skip step 5" - that is a conditional branch decision point.

- Decision Gate “TriVote” — requires approvals from all three: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer. Decision rule: any two approvals out of three suffice to pass.

Potential other decision points: The "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" outcome yields risk rating {Low, Medium, High}. That's a decision point (the outcome can be used for subsequent steps). However, the question says "decision point (gate or conditional branch)", maybe includes Tri-Color risk check is a decision point but not a branch based on condition, it's an input to subsequent steps.

Also possibly the Decision Gate "TriVote" is a gate. And there's possibly an overall approval at the end; but it's not a gate in the description (the gate includes the decision and then offers). The finalization steps don't seem to have further decision.

Thus we can list:

- Decision Point 1: Tri-Color Risk Check — determines risk rating based on Scorecard inputs.

- Decision Point 2: Conditional branch (Step 4) — if risk rating is Low or Medium AND requested amount ≤ €250,000, skip Manual Underwriting Review.

- Decision Point 3: TriVote Gate — requires three approvals; any two suffice.

Potentially also a decision about whether to proceed to step 9 after requesting applicant confirmation, but not described as decision.

Thus we can summarize each in one sentence.

Now b) List all documents required anywhere in the process, in order they first appear.

From description:

Step 1: Receive Application → Document: Form 14B.

Step 2: Assign Deck Reviewer (no document).

Step 3: Tri-Color Risk Check — inputs are three scorecards; not explicitly listed as a required document? Probably Scorecard-Cyan, Scorecard-Magenta, Scorecard-Yellow — but do we need to list them? The question says "list all documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear." Scorecards are used as inputs to the Tri-Color risk check, so they are required documents. However they aren't named in the description as "document" but they are referred as Scorecard-Cyan, etc. I think we should list them as required documents.

Step 5: Manual Underwriting Review — Document: Deck Memo.

Step 6: Decision Gate — no new document.

Step 7: Prepare Binding Offer — Document: Offer Sheet 77.

Step 8: Request Applicant Confirmation — Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration.

Step 9: Finalize Agreement — Document: Loan Dossier 2025.

Thus the documents in order:

1. Form 14B (Step 1)
2. Scorecard-Cyan (Step 3)
3. Scorecard-Magenta (Step 3)
4. Scorecard-Yellow (Step 3)
5. Deck Memo (Step 5)
6. Offer Sheet 77 (Step 7)
7. Signed Offer Sheet 77 (Step 8)
8. ID Matrix Declaration (Step 8)
9. Loan Dossier 2025 (Step 9)

Potentially we might include Scorecard-X docs, but we need to present them.

Thus answer as bullet points.

But we need to ensure we reflect the process exactly as described, without any assumption. Also mention that KYC/AML checks are not performed within this process, and no credit bureau pull occurs except the Tri-Color risk check (the risk check is based on scorecards, not necessarily bureau data). That could be included as additional context.

Now present answer concisely.

We may also need to check if the user wants the answer in one part a and one part b.

We'll structure answer:

**a) Decision Points** then bullet list.

**b) Required Documents** then bullet list with description of where appears.

Will do.

We'll embed the content in plain text, with concise descriptions.

Check for possible nuance: The Tri-Color Risk Check includes a risk rating. That is a decision point because it's a gateway: if risk is High, you cannot skip step 5, but it's not a "gate", it's an input. However the user asked "decision point (gate or conditional branch)" so they may want to list any step that involves a decision. The risk check is a decision because it yields risk rating; it's used for step 4 conditional branch; it's a decision point. We can include it.

Thus answer:

Decision Points:

1. Tri-Color Risk Check: Based on the three scorecards, the system assigns a risk rating of Low, Medium, or High.

2. Skip Manual Underwriting condition: If risk rating is Low or Medium AND requested loan amount ≤ €250,000, proceed directly to TriVote (skip Step 5).

3. TriVote Gate: Requires three separate approvals (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer); the loan proceeds if any two of the three are approved.

(Any other decision? Possibly after receiving applicant confirmation, there is a check that documents are signed before finalizing, but not described as a decision point.)

Thus answer.

Also note that the Sustainability Officer must always participate.

Thus final answer.

**a) Decision points (gate / conditional branch) – one‑sentence rule each**

| # | Decision point | Decision rule (one sentence) |
|---|----------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | **Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check** | The system evaluates **Scorecard‑Cyan**, **Scorecard‑Magenta** and **Scorecard‑Yellow** and outputs a single risk rating of **Low**, **Medium** or **High**. |
| 2 | **Skip‑Manual‑Underwriting condition** | If the risk rating from the Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check is **Low or Medium** **and** the requested loan amount is **≤ €250 000**, the process **skips** the Manual‑Underwriting‑Review (Step 5). |
| 3 | **TriVote Decision Gate** | Three parties – **Credit Lead**, **Regulatory Liaison** and **Sustainability Officer** – must each give an approval; the loan proceeds if **any two** of the three approvals are received. (The Sustainability Officer participates in every case, even for micro‑loans.) |

*(No further explicit decision gates are described; the finalization steps (preparing the offer, obtaining applicant confirmation, and creating the loan dossier) are operational steps that follow the TriVote outcome.)*  

---

**b) Required documents – in the order they first appear in the process**

| # | Document (first appearance) | Step where it appears |
|---|------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Form 14B** (the loan‑application form) | Step 1 – Receive‑Application |
| 2 | **Scorecard‑Cyan** (risk‑check scorecard) | Step 3 – Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check |
| 3 | **Scorecard‑Magenta** (risk‑check scorecard) | Step 3 – Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check |
| 4 | **Scorecard‑Yellow** (risk‑check scorecard) | Step 3 – Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check |
| 5 | **Deck Memo** (underwriting summary) | Step 5 – Manual‑Underwriting‑Review |
| 6 | **Offer Sheet 77** (binding offer) | Step 7 – Prepare‑Binding‑Offer |
| 7 | **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (applicant‑signed copy) | Step 8 – Request‑Applicant‑Confirmation |
| 8 | **ID Matrix Declaration** (identity verification) | Step 8 – Request‑Applicant‑Confirmation |
| 9 | **Loan Dossier 2025** (final contract package) | Step 9 – Finalize‑Agreement |

*Note:* KYC/AML checks and credit‑bureau pulls are **not** part of this in‑house workflow; they are handled by the third‑party vendor and therefore do not appear as required documents above.
