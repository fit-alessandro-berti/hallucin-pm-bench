Based strictly on the provided event-log fragment, the fact is NOT ACCURATE.

Justification:
• Case 1001’s activities occur in the sequence: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued. Here, "Update_Inventory" happens 4 minutes 7 seconds *before* "Authorize_Refund."
• Case 1002's process is: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued. Notice that "Update_Inventory" is omitted, meaning "Authorize_Refund" does not appear immediately after any "Update_Inventory" event.
• Case 1003 shows the sequence: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund. In this case as well, "Update_Inventory" is followed by "Quality_Check" then "Authorize_Refund," not an immediate occurrence of "Authorize_Refund" after "Update_Inventory."

Thus, in all cases with "Update_Inventory" the activity "Authorize_Refund" does not immediately follow it; they are separated by other activities or time intervals.

Final Answer: NO
