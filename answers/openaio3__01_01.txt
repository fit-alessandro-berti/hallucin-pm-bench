Decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process and the documents each one relies on  

1. Triage eligibility check  
   • Activity: Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility  
   • Decision: “Eligible” vs “Not eligible” for a refund  
   • Required documents:  
     – RefundRequestForm (submitted by the passenger)  
     – FlightManifest  
     – WeatherReport  

2. Finance pre-approval  
   • Activity: Finance_Controller_PreApprove  
   • Decision: “Pre-approved” vs “Rejected”  
   • Required document:  
     – EligibilityChecklist  

3. High-value amount routing  
   • Decision criterion embedded in the flow: “Is refund > €1 000?”  
   • Outcomes:  
     – If NO → skip Senior_Auditor_Review  
     – If YES → send case to Senior_Auditor_Review  
   • Required document for the subsequent review (if branch is taken):  
     – AuditTrail  

4. Senior auditor review (only for high-value cases)  
   • Activity: Senior_Auditor_Review  
   • Decision: “Endorsed” vs “Declined / escalated”  
   • Required document:  
     – AuditTrail (same artefact evaluated during the review)  

5. Payment readiness gate inside Process_Refund_Payment  
   • Implicit decision: “Is a signed BankTransferAuthorization on file **and** have all mandatory approvals been completed?”  
   • Required document:  
     – BankTransferAuthorization  

6. Confirmation dispatch (no branching, but document generation)  
   • Activity: Issue_Confirmation_Letter  
   • Output document:  
     – RefundConfirmationPDF
