# RACI Matrix for Order-to-Cash Workflow

| Activity | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application | R | C | I | I |
| KYC Review | I | R | I | I |
| Order Vetting | R | C | I | I |
| Payment Clearance | I | I | R | C |
| Record Update | C | I | I | R |
| Notify Customer | R | I | I | I |

**Legend:**
- **R** = Responsible (performs the activity)
- **A** = Accountable (ultimately answerable for the activity)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input/expertise)
- **I** = Informed (kept updated on progress/status)

**Note:** Each activity has one Accountable role, though in practice some accountability may be shared at an executive level. The matrix focuses on primary accountability relationships.
