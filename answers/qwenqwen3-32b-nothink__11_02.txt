**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Analysis**

To: COO – Acme Insurance  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Date: April 2025  

Based on the Q1-2025 performance dashboard, the three worst-performing activities in the *Claims Handling* process are:

1. **Request\_Documents**  
   - Average wait time of 150 minutes is excessive, and a rework rate of 22.0% is the highest of all activities.  
   - **Recommendation:** Re-evaluate the clarity and completeness of document requests during the prior *Initial Assessment* and *Check Coverage* steps. Standardizing request formats and improving guidance may reduce both wait times and rework.

2. **Review\_Documents**  
   - While processing time is relatively short (25 minutes), the average wait time (30 minutes) is significant, and the 12.4% SLA breach rate is among the highest.  
   - **Recommendation:** Explore bottleneck causes in the *Review Documents* stage—consider augmenting reviewer resources or automating document classification to decrease delays.

3. **Initial\_Assessment**  
   - A 18-minute wait time and a 3.2% SLA breach rate (second-highest) indicate inefficiencies in timely triage.  
   - **Recommendation:** Implement queue prioritization based on claim complexity and resource availability to ensure faster resolution for higher-priority cases.

These issues are compounded by the significant drop in throughput after the *Initial Assessment*, which points to cumulative process delays. By addressing these specific bottlenecks, we can improve overall speed, reduce customer frustration, and uphold service-level targets.
