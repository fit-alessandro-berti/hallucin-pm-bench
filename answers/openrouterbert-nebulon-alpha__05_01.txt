Add a **non-interrupting boundary timer event** on `Task_Check` with a 48-hour duration. If the timer fires before `Task_Check` completes, route the token via a new sequence flow to `Task_Triage` (ID `f6a`), bypassing the completeness check. This ensures triage starts within 48 hours while keeping the original path intact. No new tasks are introduced.
