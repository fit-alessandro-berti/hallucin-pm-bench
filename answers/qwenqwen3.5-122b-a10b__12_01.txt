No, the fact is **not accurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification:**
The data shows the opposite sequence in the cases where both activities occur:
*   **Case 1001:** "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02).
*   **Case 1003:** "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18).

In both instances, "Update_Inventory" precedes "Authorize_Refund," contradicting the claim that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory."
