**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance – Key Gaps & Actions**

**1. Request_Documents (Worst Overall)**
- **Throughput (190/day)** is the lowest, with **22% rework** (highest in the process) and **5.5% SLA breaches**.
- **Avg wait time (150 min)** is extreme, suggesting bottlenecks or inefficiencies in upstream activities (e.g., *Initial_Assessment* or *Check_Coverage*).
- **Action:** Audit the document request process to eliminate redundant requests and implement a **pre-approval checklist** for required documents to reduce rework.

**2. Review_Documents**
- **Avg processing time (25 min)** is the longest, with **12.4% SLA breaches** and **5.3% rework**.
- High **stdev (9 min)** indicates inconsistent review times, likely due to complex cases or unclear guidelines.
- **Action:** Standardize review criteria with a **decision-tree tool** to reduce variability and improve SLA compliance.

**3. Initial_Assessment**
- **Avg wait time (18 min)** is the second-longest, with **3.2% SLA breaches** and **1.8% rework**.
- While throughput (270/day) is strong, the wait time suggests **resource constraints** or inefficient triage.
- **Action:** Allocate additional staff during peak hours or implement **automated triage rules** to prioritize high-risk claims.

**Note:** *Pay_Claim* and *Notify_Customer* perform well, with minimal wait times and breaches. Focus should remain on the three activities above.
