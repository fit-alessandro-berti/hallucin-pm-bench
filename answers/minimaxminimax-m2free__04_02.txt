I need to analyze case #47291 against each compliance rule. Let me list the events in order:

1. Create_PO (amount = €12,450, expedited = true, hazardous = false) on 2025-03-03
2. Manager_Approval by Lee on 2025-03-03
3. Finance_Approval by Martinez on 2025-03-04
4. Change_Request for delivery_address on 2025-03-04
5. Ship_Goods by DHL on 2025-03-05
6. Receive_Goods at WH-5 on 2025-03-07
7. Pay_Invoice via SEPA on 2025-03-06
8. Manager_Approval by Lee on 2025-03-07
9. Store_Goods at Rack-21 on 2025-03-07
10. Archive_Record on 2025-03-07

Now let me check each rule:

R1: Any purchase order with total_amount > €10,000 must have Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval.
- Amount is €12,450 > €10,000 ✓
- Manager_Approval occurred on 2025-03-03 ✓
- Finance_Approval occurred on 2025-03-04 ✓
- Order is correct ✓
- COMPLIANT

R2: If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval.
- expedited = true ✓
- Last required approval was Finance_Approval on 2025-03-04
- Ship_Goods occurred on 2025-03-05
- That's 1 day later, within 2 days ✓
- COMPLIANT

R3: Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods.
- Pay_Invoice occurred on 2025-03-06
- Receive_Goods occurred on 2025-03-07
- Pay_Invoice was before Receive_Goods ✗
- VIOLATED
 
I'll continue examining the remaining compliance rules. R4 involves a safety inspection requirement based on the hazardous flag. Since the goods are not hazardous, this rule doesn't apply. R5 addresses change requests after approval, requiring a new Manager_Approval. A change request occurred on March 4th, triggering a new Manager_Approval on March 7th, which follows the protocol. R6 is straightforward - the archive record was created, so this rule is satisfied. The overall assessment shows the case as NON-COMPLIANT, primarily due to the Pay_Invoice occurring before receiving the goods.

R1. **Compliant** - Amount €12,450 > €10,000; Manager_Approval (2025-03-03) then Finance_Approval (2025-03-04) in correct order.

R2. **Compliant** - expedited = true; Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) within 2 days after Finance_Approval (2025-03-04).

R3. **Violated** - Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) occurred before Receive_Goods (2025-03-07), violating sequencing requirement.

R4. **Not Applicable** - hazardous = false, making Safety_Inspection unnecessary per rule conditions.

R5. **Compliant** - Change_Request (2025-03-04) after approvals; new Manager_Approval (2025-03-07) granted before further processing.

R6. **Compliant** - Archive_Record (2025-03-07) present, meeting termination requirement.

**NON-COMPLIANT**
