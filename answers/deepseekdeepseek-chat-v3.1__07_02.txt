Based on a meticulous comparison of the two BPMN XML versions, here is a summary of all changes, grouped under the required headings.

**Added tasks**
*   `Task_VerifyIdentity` ("Verify Identity") has been added as the first task after the start event.
*   `Task_RequestDocs` ("Request Additional Documents") has been added as a new path from the gateway.
*   `Task_FinalReject` ("Final Reject") has been added, replacing the previous `Task_RejectLoan`.

**Removed tasks**
*   `Task_RejectLoan` ("Reject Loan") has been removed.

**Gateway-type changes**
*   The gateway `Gateway_Decision` has been changed from an **Exclusive Gateway** (XOR) to an **Inclusive Gateway** (OR). Its name has also been changed from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check", but this renaming is noted here only as context for the functional type change.
