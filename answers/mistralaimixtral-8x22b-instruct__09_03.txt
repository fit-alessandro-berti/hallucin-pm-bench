Given the provided artefacts, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" because:

1. **Artefact A (Event-Log Stub)** contains no actual data—all timestamps, case IDs, and other values are redacted. Without concrete timestamps for "Approve Invoice" (start_time and complete_time), no time-based calculations are possible.
2. **Artefact B (Corporate SLA Catalogue)** only provides historical averages and SLAs, not granular data for statistical analysis.

To compute the requested metrics, the full event log (with timestamps) would be required. The current artefacts lack the necessary data.
