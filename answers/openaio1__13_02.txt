Answer:

1) Manual_Fraud_Check occurs exactly 1 time in the excerpt (in Case C05).  

2a) As a share of all 48 events, that is (1/48)*100% = 2.08%.  
2b) As a share of the 12 unique cases, that is (1/12)*100% = 8.33%.  

3) With such low frequency, this activity may distort performance metrics (e.g., average cycle time) or mislead predictive models by inflating the importance of an activity that rarely happens. Additionally, a single case exhibiting this step provides scant data, making any generalization about its impact less reliable.
