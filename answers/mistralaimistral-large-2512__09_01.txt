1) The **average cycle time (in hours) of the activity "Review Contract"** **cannot be derived** from the provided data.

2) **Explanation of calculation:**
   The event log header shows the sequence of activities and resources for each case, but **does not include timestamps or elapsed-time fields** for any activity. Without this temporal data, it is impossible to calculate the duration of "Review Contract" or any other activity, and thus the average cycle time cannot be determined. The historical benchmark provided is for a different customer segment and does not apply to this log.
