### Summary of Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

The Micro-loan Fast-Track process includes the following key decision points where outcomes determine the next steps:

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: After the Dual Underwriter Split, if the risk scores assigned by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤ 2 points, the process continues to the Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC). If the difference is > 2 points, the application is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision before proceeding.
2. **Amount Threshold Decision**: If the loan amount is < €15,000, the system auto-approves the application. If the amount is ≥ €15,000, the application proceeds to the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) for a decision.
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: For applications with amounts ≥ €15,000, the Micro-loan Board votes to either *approve* or *reject* the application before funds can be disbursed.
