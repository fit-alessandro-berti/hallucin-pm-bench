Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3** in a reachable marking. The shortest firing sequence that achieves this is **T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3**.

### Explanation of the Sequence:
- **Initial marking**: p0 = 1, all other places (pa, pb, pc, pd, pe, pf) = 0.
- **After T1 (firing)**: Consumes p0 (now 0), produces pa and pb → marking: pa = 1, pb = 1.
- **After T2b (firing)**: Consumes pa (now 0), produces pd → marking: pb = 1, pd = 1.
- **After T4 (firing)**: Consumes pb (now 0), produces pe → marking: pd = 1, pe = 1.
- **After T5 (firing)**: Consumes pd and pe (now both 0), produces pf → marking: pf = 1.  
  **At this point, T5 has fired, and T3 has not fired yet (pc = 0, so T3 cannot fire).**
- **After T6 (firing)**: Consumes pf (now 0), produces pc → marking: pc = 1.
- **After T3 (firing)**: Consumes pc (now 0), produces pd → marking: pd = 1.  
  **T3 now fires after T5, confirming T5 fired before T3.**

### Why this sequence is valid and shortest:
- **T5 cannot fire before T3** only if pd is produced by T3 (which would mean T3 fired before T5). To avoid this, pd must be produced via **T2b** (the shortcut from pa to pd), not via T3. This ensures pd is available for T5 without T3 having fired.
- **T4 is required** to produce pe from pb (since T5 needs both pd and pe).
- **T6 and T3 are necessary** after T5 to fire T3 later (T6 produces pc from pf, which is needed for T3).
- The sequence **T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3** has exactly 6 transitions. It is the shortest possible because:
  - T1 is needed to initialize the net (split from p0 to pa and pb).
  - T2b and T4 are the only ways to produce pd and pe without involving T3 (T2b for pd, T4 for pe).
  - T5 requires both pd and pe, so it must come after T2b and T4.
  - T6 and T3 are required to have T3 fire after T5 (T6 converts pf to pc, enabling T3).
- No shorter sequence exists: Any sequence missing a transition would either prevent T5 from firing (e.g., no T2b or T4) or force T3 to fire before T5 (e.g., using T2 instead of T2b).

This sequence demonstrates that **T5 fires before T3** (T5 at step 4, T3 at step 6 in the firing sequence), and it is reachable from the initial marking.

**Shortest firing sequence:** T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3
