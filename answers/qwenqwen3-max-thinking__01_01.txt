**Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Refund Process:**

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   – Decision: Whether the passenger’s claim is eligible for a refund.  
   – Basis: Comparison of the *RefundRequestForm* against the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   – Decision: Whether to pre-approve the refund based on the *EligibilityChecklist*.  
   – This step confirms procedural compliance but does not yet authorize payment.

3. **High-value refund check (€1 000 threshold)**  
   – Decision: Whether the refund amount exceeds €1 000.  
   – If **yes**, the process **must** include **Senior_Auditor_Review** with an *AuditTrail*.  
   – If **no**, the process skips **Senior_Auditor_Review**.
