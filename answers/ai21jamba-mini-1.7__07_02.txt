- Task_RequestDocs (BPMN_v2): Added for requesting additional documents when eligibility criteria are not fully met.
- Task_FinalReject (BPMN_v2): Added as a separate task to explicitly handle final rejection of the loan application.

##### **Removed Tasks**

- Task_ReviewApplication (BPMN_v1): Removed as its functionality is now covered by Task_VerifyIdentity and Task_ApproveLoan.
