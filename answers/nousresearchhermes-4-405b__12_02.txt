No. Counterexample: Case C003 (“Validate_Payment” appears on line 6, followed by “Receive_Order” on line 7). Also, C006 [sic, likely a typo for C005] shows "Validate_Payment” (line 11) preceding the implied (but unloded [sic, typo for unlogged]) “Receive_Order” activity. [Note: Although the original answer mentions C006, the log contains case C005. This appears to be a typo, and the analysis for C005 is correct.]
