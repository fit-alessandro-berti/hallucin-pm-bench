Question 1.  Yes – such a marking exists.

Question 2.  Minimal sequence:  ⟨T1, T2, T7, T4, T5⟩.

Explanation (66 words).  
T1 consumes the initial token in P0 and produces tokens in P1 and P2.  
The P1-token is routed via T2 (to P3) and T7 (to P4); T4 then moves it from P4 to P5.  
At this point the marking is { P2, P5 }.  
Because both input places of T5 now hold a token, T5 is enabled and can fire, even though T3 has never occurred.
