The **FACT is inaccurate** based on the provided event-log fragment.

**Justification**:
- In **Case 1001**, **Update_Inventory** occurs *before* **Authorize_Refund** (timestamps 08:25:55 vs. 08:30:02).
- In **Case 1003**, **Update_Inventory** also precedes **Authorize_Refund** (10:08:07 vs. 10:22:18).
- Only **Case 1002** follows the claimed sequence, but **Authorize_Refund** occurs *without* a preceding **Update_Inventory** at all.

Thus, the data shows **no case** where **Authorize_Refund** occurs *immediately before* **Update_Inventory**. The opposite or alternative sequences are observed.
