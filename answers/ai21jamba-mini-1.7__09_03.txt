To compute the average cycle time for the activity "Approve Invoice" and its statistical measures, we would need the timestamps for each activity in the log. Specifically, we require the `start_time` and `complete_time` for the "Approve Invoice" activity for all cases. Without these timestamps, we cannot determine the duration of the activity for individual cases, which is essential for calculating cycle times.

The given event-log stub lacks timestamps and any specific activity durations. While we can infer from the corporate SLA that the average time from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice" is approximately 7.8 days, this information is a historical average and does not provide the necessary granularity to calculate cycle times for individual cases.

In summary, without the specific timestamps for the "Approve Invoice" activity, we cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval. The lack of detailed timestamp data in the log prevents us from performing this analysis.
