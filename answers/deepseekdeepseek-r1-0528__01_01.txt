### Summary of Decision Points in Contoso Airlines' Refund Process  
1. **High-value refund decision** (at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**):  
   - **Condition**: If the refund amount exceeds **€1,000**, the case **must** proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review**.  
   - **Outcome**:  
     - **> €1,000**: Senior_Auditor_Review is required.  
     - **≤ €1,000**: Senior_Auditor_Review is skipped, and the process proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.  

### Required Documents per Process Step  
- **Customer_Submit_Claim**:  
  - `RefundRequestForm` (submitted by the passenger).  
- **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**:  
  - `FlightManifest` (to verify passenger/booking details).  
  - `WeatherReport` (to validate flight disruption causes).  
- **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**:  
  - `EligibilityChecklist` (used for sign-off).  
- **Senior_Auditor_Review** (high-value branch only):  
  - `AuditTrail` (mandatory for review).  
- **Process_Refund_Payment**:  
  - `BankTransferAuthorization` (signed document for payment execution).  
- **Issue_Confirmation_Letter**:  
  - `RefundConfirmationPDF` (emailed to the passenger).  

### Key Constraints Enforced  
- **Process_Refund_Payment** requires:  
  - Successful **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** (always).  
  - Completed **Senior_Auditor_Review** (only if refund > €1,000).  
- **No other decision points or documents** exist (e.g., "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" is excluded per process rules).
