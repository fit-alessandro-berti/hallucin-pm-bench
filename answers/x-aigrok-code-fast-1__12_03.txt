No

Justification:
- The FACT is not accurate because in C002, "Validate_Payment" occurs after "Pack_Items," not immediately after "Receive_Order" (sequence: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment).
- The FACT is also not accurate in C004, where "Validate_Payment" occurs after "Check_Fraud," not immediately after "Receive_Order" (sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment).
- While C001 and C003 show "Validate_Payment" immediately after "Receive_Order," the presence of counterexamples in C002 and C004 makes the statement "always" incorrect. C003 also includes "Ship_Order" after "Validate_Payment," but this does not impact the sequencing between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment."
