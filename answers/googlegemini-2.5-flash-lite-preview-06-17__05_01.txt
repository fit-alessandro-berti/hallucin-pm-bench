To ensure claims reach "Triage Claim" within the 48-hour SLA, introduce a timer event. Place a **Timer Intermediate Event** linked to the `Task_Check` activity. This timer should be configured with a duration of 48 hours. If `Task_Check` is not completed within this timeframe, the timer will fire.

Reconnect the timer event to the `Task_Triage` activity. This bypasses `Task_RequestDocs` and `Task_Check` if the SLA is breached, automatically escalating the claim to triage. This modification achieves auto-escalation without adding new tasks.
