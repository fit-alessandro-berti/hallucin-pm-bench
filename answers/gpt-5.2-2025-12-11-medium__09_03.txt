I cannot compute the average cycle time (in hours) of “Approve Invoice,” its standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval from the supplied artefacts because Artefact A contains only the event-log schema (column headers) and no actual event records or timestamp values. To calculate these metrics, I would need, at minimum, the “start_time” and “complete_time” for each occurrence of activity = “Approve Invoice” (to derive each instance’s duration), plus the number of such occurrences (sample size) to compute the mean and standard deviation and to form a 95% confidence interval. Artefact B provides only SLA targets and a historical average for a different interval (“Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice”), which is not sufficient to infer the “Approve Invoice” activity’s own cycle times.
