I cannot compute the average cycle time for "Approve Invoice" at all, nor calculate its standard deviation or confidence interval. Here's precisely why:

The event log stub (Artefact A) contains **no actual event data**—every row and timestamp is redacted. Without any observable instances of "Approve Invoice" activity (including their start_time and complete_time values), there is **no empirical data** to analyze. The header columns confirm what data *would* be present (including timestamps and cost_EUR), but these are absent. Consequently, no duration can be calculated for any "Approve Invoice" case. The SLA average from Artefact B (7.8 days) relates to a different metric (total cycle time from Approve to Pay) and cannot be decomposed into component times for "Approve Invoice" alone. No external knowledge is used; the limitation stems purely from the lack of usable data.
