Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

### Concrete Firing Sequence

Here is a concrete firing sequence from the initial marking that demonstrates this possibility:

1.  **Fire T1**
2.  **Fire T2**
3.  **Fire T5**

### Justification

Let's trace the state of the Petri net through this sequence.

**Initial Marking (M0):**
*   `p0(1)` - All other places have 0 tokens.

**Step 1: Fire T1**
*   T1 is enabled because it requires one token in `p0`.
*   Firing T1 consumes the token from `p0` and produces one token in `p1` and one token in `p2`.
*   **New Marking (M1):** `p1(1)`, `p2(1)`.
*   At this point, T3 has **not** fired. Its input place, `p2`, has a token, but the transition itself has not been activated.

**Step 2: Fire T2**
*   From Marking M1, T2 is enabled because it requires one token in `p1`.
*   Firing T2 consumes the token from `p1` and produces one token in `p3`.
*   **New Marking (M2):** `p2(1)`, `p3(1)`.
*   T3 has still **not** fired. Its input place, `p2`, still contains a token.

**Step 3: Fire T5**
*   From Marking M2, we check if T5 is enabled. T5 has two conditions:
    1.  It requires a token in its input place, `p3`.
    2.  It requires that its inhibitor place, `p4`, has **zero** tokens.
*   In Marking M2, `p3` has 1 token and `p4` has 0 tokens. Therefore, T5 is enabled.
*   Firing T5 consumes the token from `p3` and produces one token in `p6`.
*   **Final Marking:** `p2(1)`, `p6(1)`.

**Conclusion:**
The firing sequence `T1 → T2 → T5` is valid. In this sequence, T5 fires in the third step, while T3 never fires at all. Therefore, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3. The key is the inhibitor arc on T5 (`-|p4`), which prevents T5 from firing if T3 has placed a token in `p4`. By firing T2 before T3, we place a token in `p3` while `p4` remains empty, thus enabling T5.
