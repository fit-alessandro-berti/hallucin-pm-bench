Here are the answers based strictly on the provided data:

1️⃣ The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs **1** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might undercount the actual frequency of manual fraud checks in the full log. This is because the event log excerpt is labeled as *FinFast_Loans_March2025.csv*, suggesting it's only a *part* of the data for March 2025. The excerpt contains data from only a fraction of March 1st. Therefore, the observation of only one manual fraud check in this small sample does not reflect the frequency across the entire month's data.
