**1.** The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** appears **once** in the excerpt.  

**2.** Because the snippet shows only three cases from a single day, an analyst might infer that roughly one‑third of applications involve a manual fraud check. However, the sample is tiny and possibly biased (e.g., the chosen cases may have required manual review). Without the full month‑long log, the observed proportion could greatly over‑ or under‑represent the true frequency of manual fraud checks in the entire dataset.
