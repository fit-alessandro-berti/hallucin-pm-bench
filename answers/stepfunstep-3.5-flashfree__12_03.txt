No

Justification:  
- In Case C002, the sequence is Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05). Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.  
- In Case C004, the sequence is Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20). Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.  
Therefore, Validate_Payment does not always occur immediately after Receive_Order with no intervening activities.
