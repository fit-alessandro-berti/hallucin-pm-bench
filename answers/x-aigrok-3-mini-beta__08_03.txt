Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking.

The shortest firing sequence that achieves this is:  
**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

This sequence starts from the initial marking (p0 = 1) and results in T5 firing while T3 has not fired. Below is a step-by-step verification of the markings:

- Initial marking: p0 = 1  
- After T1: p0 = 0, pa = 1, pb = 1  
- After T2b: pa = 0, pb = 1, pd = 1  
- After T4: pb = 0, pd = 1, pe = 1  
- After T5: pd = 0, pe = 0, pf = 1  

At the point T5 fires, T3 cannot fire because place pc is empty (it requires a token in pc, which is only produced by T2, and T2 was not fired in this sequence).
