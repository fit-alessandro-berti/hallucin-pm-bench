1. **Violation of Rule 2**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (Activity 4), which requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Risk_Assessment` (Activity 9) happens **after** `Ship_Goods` (Activity 8).  
2. **Violation of Rule 3**: After `Goods_Received` (Activity 6), `Three_way_match` (Activity 10) must occur **within the next two activities** (distance ≤ 2). Here, `Three_way_match` occurs **four activities later** (Activities 7, 8, 9, 10), exceeding the allowed distance.
