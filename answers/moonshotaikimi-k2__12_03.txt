**Answer: No**

**Justification based on the event-log excerpt:**

- **Case02**: the trace shows  
  Receive_Order (2025-01-03T09:30:00) → **Pack_Items (2025-01-03T09:50:00)** → Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:05:00).  
  Hence “Pack_Items” occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment,” so the statement that nothing else happens in between is false.

- **Case04**: the trace shows  
  Receive_Order (2025-01-03T10:05:00) → **Check_Fraud (2025-01-03T10:07:00)** → Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:20:00).  
  Again, the insertion of “Check_Fraud” between the two activities violates the FACT.

Since at least these two cases contain other activities between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment,” the alleged “always” rule does **not** hold for this log snippet.
