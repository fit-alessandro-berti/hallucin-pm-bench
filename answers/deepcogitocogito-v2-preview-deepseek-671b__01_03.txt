Okay, let me tackle part (a) first. I need to summarize every decision point in Acme’s loan-approval process. Let me go through the process step by step.

First, step 3 is the Tri-Color-Risk-Check. That produces a risk rating of Low, Medium, or High. Then in step 4, there's a conditional check: if the risk is Low or Medium AND the requested amount is €250,000 or less, it skips step 5. Otherwise, it proceeds to step 5, Manual-Underwriting-Review. 

Wait, is that the first decision point? The Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself is a step, but the actual branch decision is in step 4. The note says "Outcome = {Low, Medium, High} risk rating," but the branch is based on that outcome. So the first decision point is that conditional in step 4, which skips step 5 under those conditions.

Then, step 6 is the Decision-Gate "TriVote." It requires approvals from three roles: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer. The rule is that any two out of three approvals are needed to pass. So that's the second decision point.

Are there any other decision points? Let me check. The process starts with receiving the application, assigning a deck reviewer, then the risk check, then the conditional step, then possibly the manual underwriting, then the TriVote, then preparing the offer, requesting confirmation, and finalizing. So I think those are the only two decision points. 

Now, for part (b), listing all documents in order of first appearance. Let me go through each step.

1. Form 14B is listed under Receive-Application.
2. Then in step 5, Manual-Underwriting-Review, the document is Deck Memo.
3. In step 7, Prepare-Binding-Offer, the document is Offer Sheet 77.
4. Step 8 has Signed Offer Sheet 77 (but that's after confirmation) and ID Matrix Declaration.
5. Step 9 has Loan Dossier 2025.

Additionally, the Tri-Color-Risk-Check uses Scorecard–Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow. Are those considered documents? They're inputs, so probably yes. They're listed under step 3.

So in order of first appearance:

1. Form 14B (step 1)
2. Scorecard–Cyan (step 3)
3. Scorecard–Magenta (step 3)
4. Scorecard–Yellow (step 3)
5. Deck Memo (step 5, if manual underwriting is needed)
6. Offer Sheet 77 (step 7)
7. ID Matrix Declaration (step 8)
8. Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8, but it's part of the confirmation, so maybe it's the same as Offer Sheet 77, but signed)
9. Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9)

Wait, the Signed Offer Sheet 77 is a separate document because it's the signed version. But the Offer Sheet 77 is prepared in step 7, and then in step 8, it's signed. So the document first appears in step 7 as the unsigned version, and then in step 8 as signed. But for the list, it's the same document, just signed later. However, the question is about documents required, so both the unsigned (for preparation) and signed (for confirmation) might be considered. But the process requires the signed one in step 8, so perhaps only the signed version is listed when it's required. Hmm.

But the first appearance of Offer Sheet 77 is in step 7, even if it's not signed yet. The ID Matrix Declaration is a separate document in step 8. And Loan Dossier 2025 in step 9.

For the Scorecards: they're inputs in step 3, so they should be listed when they're first used, which is step 3. Similarly, Deck Memo is step 5, but only if the process goes there. However, the question says "required anywhere in the process," so even if a document is conditional, it should be listed because it's part of the process. 

So the complete list in order:

1. Form 14B (step 1)
2. Scorecard–Cyan (step 3)
3. Scorecard–Magenta (step 3)
4. Scorecard–Yellow (step 3)
5. Deck Memo (step 5, but only if the condition in step 4 is not met)
6. Offer Sheet 77 (step 7)
7. ID Matrix Declaration (step 8)
8. Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8)
9. Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9)

But is the Deck Memo required? It's only produced if the process reaches step 5. However, the question asks for documents required anywhere in the process, so if under some conditions it is needed, then it should be included. Since step 5 is conditional, but part of the process, Deck Memo is required in those cases. So yes, include it.

Finally, the TriVote itself doesn't produce a document, but the approvals are part of the decision gate. The documents are listed separately. So I think that's all.
**a) Decision Points Summary:**

1. **Step 4 Risk Threshold & Amount Check**  
   *Description:* Proceeds only if risk is Low/Medium AND requested amount ≤ €250,000; otherwise requires manual underwriting.

2. **Step 6 TriVote Gateway**  
   *Description:* Loan advances only if at least two of the three officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve.

**b) Complete Document List in Order of First Appearance:**

1. Form 14B (Application Form)
2. Scorecard–Cyan
3. Scorecard–Magenta
4. Scorecard–Yellow
5. Deck Memo (conditional on Tri-Color risk/amount outcome)
6. Offer Sheet 77
7. ID Matrix Declaration
8. Signed Offer Sheet 77 (completed confirmation)
9. Loan Dossier 2025

*Note:* Documents maintain Acme's internal naming conventions (e.g., "Offer Sheet 77") as specified in the original process documentation. While some documents like the Deck Memo are conditional, they are included as required components of the end-to-end process.
