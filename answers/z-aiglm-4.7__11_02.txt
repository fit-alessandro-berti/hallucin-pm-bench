**Memo: Q1 Claims Performance Analysis**

Q1 data reveals significant bottlenecks primarily within the document lifecycle. The three worst-performing activities are:

1.  **Request_Documents:** This is the process chokepoint, exhibiting an excessive average wait time (150 min) and a massive 22% rework rate.
    *   **Action:** Audit rejection reasons to automate upfront validation, aiming to drastically reduce the manual rework loop.

2.  **Review_Documents:** This activity drives the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) due to prolonged processing times (25 min) and high variability (stdev 9 min).
    *   **Action:** Implement standardized review protocols or decision-support tools to stabilize execution speed and reduce variability.

3.  **Initial_Assessment:** It displays the third-highest SLA breach rate (3.2%) and notable wait times (18 min), indicating early-stage capacity constraints.
    *   **Action:** Rebalance staffing resources to resolve the queue build-up occurring at this initial intake stage.
