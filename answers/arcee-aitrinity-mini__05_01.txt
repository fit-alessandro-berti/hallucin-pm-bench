Add a timer start event to the process root that enforces a 48-hour deadline for completing "Triage Claim". Specifically, modify the flow from Start_Claim to establish a schedule Arraging Flow (SAF) based on the SLA target, triggering Escalation Steps (ES) if not met, ensuring time-bound status tracking. This leverages existing configuration without adding tasks.
