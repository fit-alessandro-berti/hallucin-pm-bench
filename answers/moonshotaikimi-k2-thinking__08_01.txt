**Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**

One concrete firing sequence that shows this is:

1. **T1** fires (p0 → p1 + p2)  
   *Marking:* p1 = 1, p2 = 1.

2. **T2** fires (p1 → p3)  
   *Marking:* p2 = 1, p3 = 1, p4 = 0.

3. **T5** fires (p3 –|p4 → p6)  
   *Marking:* p2 = 1, p6 = 1.

At step 2 the token is already in p3 while p4 is still empty, so T5’s inhibitor‑arc condition is satisfied. T5 therefore becomes enabled and can fire immediately, before T3 ever consumes the token from p2. Hence T5 can indeed fire before T3.
