1️⃣ The activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **two times** in this excerpt: once for CaseID 1002 and once for CaseID 1003.

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of **“Manual Fraud Check”** in the full log for the following reasons:

- The occurrence of **manual reviews** in this snippet is evenly distributed across **CaseIDs 1002 and 1003**, but this might not reflect the full dataset's distribution. A higher concentration of manual reviews in one part of the log could skew perceived frequency.
- The absence of other activities or timestamps in this snippet might mislead the analyst into thinking **manual reviews are isolated or rare** when they could actually follow distinct patterns or clusters in the full log.
- Broader context, such as timestamps or preceding/following activities, is missing, so the analyst cannot assess potential interdependencies or seasonal trends.
