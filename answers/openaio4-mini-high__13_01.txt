1. Exactly 1 occurrence of “Manual_Fraud_Check.”  
2. That is 1/18 ≈ 5.56 % of all logged events.  
3. The only case containing “Manual_Fraud_Check” is A1002.  
4. Two sampling-related reasons why a monthly estimate based on this fragment is unreliable:  
   • Very limited time window: the log covers only a single day (2025-05-01), so it may not capture daily/weekly/monthly variation in fraud-check rates.  
   • Small and non-random sample: with only 18 events (and only one fraud check) the sample is too small to yield stable estimates and may be heavily influenced by outliers or atypical days.
