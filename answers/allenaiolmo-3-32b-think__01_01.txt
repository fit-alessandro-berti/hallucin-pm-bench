1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision**: Determine if the claim is eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.  
   - **Outcome**: Proceed to *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* if eligible; otherwise, reject the claim.  

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   - **Decision**: Approve or deny the pre-authorization using the *EligibilityChecklist*.  
   - **Outcome**: Proceed to *Senior_Auditor_Review* (if high-value) or *Process_Refund_Payment* (if approved).  

3. **High-Value Threshold Check** (implicit decision point)  
   - **Decision**: Automatically evaluate if the refund amount **exceeds €1,000**.  
   - **Outcome**: If yes, route to *Senior_Auditor_Review*; if no, proceed directly to *Process_Refund_Payment*.
