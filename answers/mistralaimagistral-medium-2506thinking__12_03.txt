### Summary

The initial assumption in the high-level process model was to verify that for all instances in the submission, the “Validate_Payment” activity runs directly after the "Receive_Order" event.  However, in the event-log excerpt, two counterexamples demonstrate that this is not the case:

- in case C002, the “Pack_Items” activity occurs between the two events,
- in case C004 “Check_Fraud” is placed in an immediate sequential position.

Therefore, the FACT is not accurate. It is essential to highlight that incoming initiatives could clue on the discovered process and adapt it accordingly.

1. **Answer:** No
2. **Justification:** In cases C002 and C004, there are activities between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," specifically:
   - In C002: "Pack_Items" occurs between them.
   - In C004: "Check_Fraud" occurs between them.

Thus, the FACT is not accurate because "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order."

\boxed{No}
