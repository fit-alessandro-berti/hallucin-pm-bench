To enforce the 48-hour SLA without adding tasks, add a **boundary timer event** (`id="Timer_Escalate"`) to `Task_Triage` (sourceRef="Task_Triage") with a 48-hour delay. Connect it to a new **escalation flow** (`id="f10"`) targeting an existing or new end event (e.g., `End_Escalate`). This ensures claims auto-escalate if untriaged within 48 hours. The existing flows (`f6`, `f7`, etc.) remain unchanged, preserving the core process while adding SLA compliance. No new tasks are introduced—only a timer event and flow.
