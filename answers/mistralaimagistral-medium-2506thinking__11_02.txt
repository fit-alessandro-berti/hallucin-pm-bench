**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review**

The Q1-2025 performance data highlights three key activities that require immediate attention to improve process efficiency and performance:

1. **Request Documents** stands out with an extremely high wait time of 150 minutes and a rework rate of 22%, indicating a major bottleneck and inefficiency in initial document requests.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement automated validation checks to reduce rework and allocate additional resources to decrease wait times.

2. **Review Documents** is plagued by a high SLA breach rate (12.4%), lengthy processing times (25 minutes), and significant variability (9 minutes), suggesting inefficiencies and inconsistencies.
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize review protocols and invest in training or automation tools to improve consistency and reduce SLA breaches.

3. **Initial Assessment** exhibits moderately high wait times (18 minutes), processing times (12 minutes), and SLA breach rates (3.2%), pointing to delays and potential inefficiencies.
   - **Recommendation**: Optimize assessment criteria and provide targeted training to streamline processes and minimize errors.

Addressing these areas will significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of the Claims Handling process.
