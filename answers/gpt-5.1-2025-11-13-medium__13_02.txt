1. Occurrences of **Manual_Fraud_Check**: **1**  

2. Percentages  
   a) Of all **events**:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{48} \times 100 \approx 2.08\%
   \]  
   b) Of all **unique cases** (12 total):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{12} \times 100 \approx 8.33\%
   \]

3. With only one occurrence in 48 events and 12 cases, **Manual_Fraud_Check** is an extreme low-support behavior. Any observed duration, ordering, or outcome correlation for this activity is statistically fragile. Treating it as typical can distort average processing times, path frequencies, and model training, leading to overfitting and misleading “rules” that are actually based on a single exceptional case.
