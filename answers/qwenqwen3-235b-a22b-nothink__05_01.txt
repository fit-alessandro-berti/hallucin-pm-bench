To meet the 48-hour SLA for "Triage Claim," **reconnect flow `f7` (originally from `Task_Triage` to `Task_Assign`) to point to `Task_Check` instead**. This aligns with swapping the order of triage and completeness checks. After `Task_Check` (via `GW_Docs`), flows `f5` (complete) and `f6` (missing docs) should now target `Task_Assign` instead of looping back to `Task_Triage`. This ensures triage occurs immediately after claim submission, meeting the SLA while retaining all existing tasks. No new tasks are added, and flows are reconnected to prevent redundant triage after document resolution.
