### **Key**  
- **R** = Who performs the work.  
- **A** = Who is ultimately accountable (final approval).  
- **C** = Who is consulted for input (2-way communication).  
- **I** = Who is kept informed (1-way communication).  

---

### **Notes**  
1. **Terminology Adherence**:  
   - Activities use preferred terms: "KYC Review" (not Customer Due Diligence), "Order Vetting" (not Order Validation), "Payment Clearance" (not Payment Processing).  
   - Forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence," "Order Validation," "Payment Processing") are **not used**, even in brackets or quotes.  

2. **Role Assignments**:  
   - **AM (Account Manager)** is **Responsible** for *all* application-related activities and **Accountable** for *Receive Application*, *Order Vetting*, *Notify Customer*.  
   - **CO (Compliance Officer)** is **Responsible** for *KYC Review* and **Accountable** for *KYC Review*.  
   - **FC (Finance Clerk)** is **Responsible** and **Accountable** for *Payment Clearance*.  
   - **IT Support** is **Responsible** for *Record Update* and **Consulted** for *KYC Review*, *Order Vetting*, *Notify Customer*.  
   - **CO is Consulted** for *Notify Customer* to ensure compliance oversight.  
   - **AM is Informed** for *Record Update* to confirm CRM accuracy.  

3. **RACI Rules**:  
   - Each activity has at least one **R** and one **A**.  
   - Roles with **R** and/or **A** across activities: **AM (6 R/A), CO (2 R/A), FC (2 R/A), IT (1 R/A)**.  

4. **Process Logic**:  
   - AM drives front-end tasks (Receive Application → Notify Customer).  
   - CO owns compliance (KYC Review) and oversight (Consulted roles).  
   - FC handles settlement finality (Payment Clearance).  
   - IT ensures data integrity (Record Update) and system support (Consulted roles).
