Based on the provided event-log fragment, the fact "Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory within the same case" is not accurate.

Here are the relevant case IDs and activities:

- Case 1001: Authorize_Refund occurs before Update_Inventory.
- Case 1002: Authorize_Refund occurs before Refund_Issued, not Update_Inventory.
- Case 1003: Authorize_Refund occurs before Quality_Check, not Update_Inventory.

Thus, the fact is not supported by the data, as there is no case where Authorize_Refund is immediately followed by Update_Inventory.
