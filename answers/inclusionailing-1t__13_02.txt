1. **"Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time** in the excerpt (only in case C05).

2.  
   a) **Percentage of all events**: Total events = 48.  
      (1 / 48) × 100 = **2.08%**  
   b) **Percentage of unique cases**: Total cases = 12.  
      (1 / 12) × 100 = **8.33%**

3. Such a low-support activity (appearing in only 1 case and 2.08% of events) risks distortion if generalized: rare variants skew average cycle times, may be ignored by pattern discovery algorithms, and can lead to overfitting or false causal inferences due to insufficient representation for reliable analysis or prediction based on this slice alone.
