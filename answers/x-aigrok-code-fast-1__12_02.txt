No

The fact is inaccurate because Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order. For example, in C003 (lines 6 and 7), Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order, and for C005 (line 11), Validate_Payment appears without any preceding Receive_Order. Although it follows in C001 (lines 1-2), C002 (lines 3-5), and C004 (lines 8-9), the counterexamples in C003 and C005 show the claim does not hold universally.
