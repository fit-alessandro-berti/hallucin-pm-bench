### Decision Points in Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**:  
   - If the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤ 2 points, proceed to step 6.
   - Else, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision, then continue.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**:  
   - If the amount is < €15,000, the system auto-approves.
   - If the amount is ≥ €15,000, proceed to step 8.

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**:  
   - The board votes to approve or reject the application.
