No. While cases C001 (lines 1–2), C002 (lines 3–5), and C004 (lines 8–9) show Validate_Payment following Receive_Order, case C003 has Validate_Payment (line 6) occurring before Receive_Order (line 7), and case C005 has Validate_Payment (line 11) without any preceding Receive_Order in the fragment, so the “always follows” claim is violated.
