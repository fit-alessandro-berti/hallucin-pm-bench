**Yes.**

Shortest firing sequence: **T1, T2b, T4, T5**

**Explanation**:  
- T1 fires: consumes p0, produces pa, pb  
- T2b fires: consumes pa, produces pd  
- T4 fires: consumes pb, produces pe  
- T5 fires: consumes pd, pe, produces pf  

At this point, T5 has fired and pc remains empty (0 tokens), so T3 has not fired.
