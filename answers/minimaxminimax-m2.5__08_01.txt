**Answer: Yes.**  

A reachable marking exists in which `T5` fires before `T3` ever fires.

### Concrete firing sequence (starting from the initial marking)

| Step | Firing | Marking (p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6) |
|------|--------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | –      | (1 0 0 0 0 0 0)                |
| 1    | `T1`   | (0 1 1 0 0 0 0)                |
| 2    | `T2`   | (0 0 1 1 0 0 0)                |
| 3    | `T5`   | (0 0 1 0 0 0 1)                |

*After step 2* we have a token in `p3` (`p3 = 1`) while `p4` is still empty (`p4 = 0`).  
Because `T5` has a **normal arc** from `p3` and an **inhibitor arc** from `p4`, it is **enabled** exactly when `p3` holds a token **and** `p4` contains no token. The condition is satisfied, so `T5` can fire.

At this point `T3` (which would consume the token in `p2` and place a token in `p4`) has **not** been fired yet; therefore `T5` fires **before** `T3`.

---

### Why this is possible

- `T1` creates the two parallel branches (`p1` and `p2`).
- `T2` moves the token from `p1` to `p3`, giving the required input for `T5`.
- Because `T3` has not been executed, `p4` remains empty, satisfying the inhibitor condition of `T5`.
- Hence `T5` can fire while `p2` (the input of `T3`) still holds a token.

Thus, in a reachable marking, `T5` can indeed fire before `T3`.
