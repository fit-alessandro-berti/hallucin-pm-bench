Below is a complete and self-contained response to your query based on the provided XES event log fragment. I'll answer each question step by step.

### Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?
- The cases in the log are identified by the "case" attribute in each event.
- The unique cases are: C001, C002, and C003.
- Therefore, there are **3 distinct cases**.

### Q2: For case "C002", list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use "→" as the separator).
- First, I filtered the events for case "C002" and extracted the "concept:name" attribute.
- The events for C002, in the order they appear (based on the timestamps), are:
  - Receive_Order (from line 2)
  - Check_Stock (from line 5)
  - Arrange_Delivery (from line 8)
  - Ship_Order (from line 10)
- The sequence of activities is: **Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**.

### Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" (one per line, alphabetically ordered).
- To answer this, I examined each case and identified the activity that directly precedes "Ship_Order" in that case's sequence.
- For C001: The activity immediately before "Ship_Order" (line 7) is "Check_Stock".
- For C002: The activity immediately before "Ship_Order" (line 10) is "Arrange_Delivery".
- For C003: The activity immediately before "Ship_Order" (line 9) is "Check_Stock".
- The distinct activities that precede "Ship_Order" are: "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock".
- Alphabetically ordered: "Arrange_Delivery" comes before "Check_Stock".
- The list is:

  ```
  Arrange_Delivery
  Check_Stock
  ```
