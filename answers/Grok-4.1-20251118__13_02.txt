### Answers based solely on the provided log excerpt

1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs **1 time**.

2.  
   a) Percentage of all events (48 events total): **2.08%** (1 / 48 × 100 = 2.08)  
   b) Percentage of all unique cases (12 cases total): **8.33%** (1 / 12 × 100 = 8.33)

3. Manual_Fraud_Check appears in only one case (C05) out of twelve. With such low support (8.33% of cases), any performance metrics (e.g., average duration involving manual checks) or predictive models trained primarily on this slice would be dominated by the far more frequent auto-check path. Generalising from this excerpt risks severely overestimating the prevalence and impact of manual fraud checks, leading to inaccurate bottleneck identification, wrong predictions, and misleading process optimisations.
