Let's analyze the XES event log fragment step by step.

---

### **Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

We look at the `case` attribute in each event:

- Line 1: `C001`
- Line 2: `C002`
- Line 3: `C001`
- Line 4: `C003`
- Line 5: `C002`
- Line 6: `C003`
- Line 7: `C001`
- Line 8: `C002`
- Line 9: `C003`
- Line 10: `C002`

The distinct case IDs are: **C001, C002, C003**

✅ **Answer: 3 distinct cases**

---

### **Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

We extract all events for `case="C002"` and order them by `time:timestamp`:

- Line 2: `Receive_Order` at `2025-03-01T09:15:10`
- Line 5: `Check_Stock` at `2025-03-01T09:22:55`
- Line 8: `Arrange_Delivery` at `2025-03-01T10:15:20`
- Line 10: `Ship_Order` at `2025-03-01T10:25:40`

So the sequence is:

**Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

✅ **Answer: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

---

### **Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**

We need to find, for every occurrence of `Ship_Order`, what the **immediately preceding activity** was in the same case.

Let's go through each `Ship_Order` event:

- **Line 7**: `case="C001"`, `Ship_Order` at `10:05:10`  
  → Previous event for C001:  
    - Line 3: `Check_Stock` (at 09:20:05) → **This is the immediate predecessor**

- **Line 9**: `case="C003"`, `Ship_Order` at `10:20:30`  
  → Previous event for C003:  
    - Line 6: `Check_Stock` (at 09:25:05) → **This is the immediate predecessor**

- **Line 10**: `case="C002"`, `Ship_Order` at `10:25:40`  
  → Previous event for C002:  
    - Line 8: `Arrange_Delivery` (at 10:15:20) → **This is the immediate predecessor**

So, the activities that immediately precede `Ship_Order` are:

- `Check_Stock` (for C001)
- `Check_Stock` (for C003)
- `Arrange_Delivery` (for C002)

Now, **distinct** activities: `Check_Stock`, `Arrange_Delivery`

Alphabetically ordered:

- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

✅ **Answer (alphabetically ordered):**

```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```

### ✅ Final Answers:

**Q1:** 3  
**Q2:** Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
**Q3:**
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
