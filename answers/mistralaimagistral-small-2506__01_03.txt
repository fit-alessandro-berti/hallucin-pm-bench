### **a) Decision Points in Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS Loan Approval Process**

1. **Risk Rating Check (Step 3)** – The tri-color risk check assigns {Low, Medium, High} based on the three scorecards, determining if manual underwriting (Step 5) is skipped or required.
2. **Low/Medium Risk & Amount Threshold (Step 4)** – If risk is {Low, Medium} **AND** the requested amount ≤ €250,000, **skip** manual underwriting; otherwise, proceed to manual review (Step 5).
3. **TriVote Decision Gate (Step 6)** – The credit deal passes if **at least two** out of the three approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve it.
