**Subject:** Executive Summary: *Claims Handling Process Performance*

**To:** Chief Operating Officer, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Process Performance Analysis Team  
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Executive Summary:**

The first-quarter 2025 *Claims Handling* process dashboard reveals significant performance challenges across several activities. *Review_Documents*, *Request_Documents*, and *Approve_Claim* represent the three most underperforming activities relative to our benchmarks and internal standards, respectively.

---

### **Key Underperformance Areas:**

1.  **Review_Documents:**
    *   **Why:** This activity exhibits the highest percentage of SLA breaches (12.4%) and the second-highest rework rate (5.3%). These figures indicate frequent delays beyond acceptable limits and a high incidence of cases needing correction, likely contributing significantly to overall claim cycle time and resource consumption.

2.  **Request_Documents:**
    *   **Why:** While rework is lower (22.0%), Request_Documents has the second-highest SLA breach rate (5.5%) and the worst average wait time (150 minutes). This long delay before the activity starts significantly hampers the downstream processing of documents within the claims lifecycle.

3.  **Approve_Claim:**
    *   **Why:** Approve_Claim shows a persistently high SLA breach percentage (0.9%), nearly double the next highest listed (Check_Coverage at 1.5%). Furthermore, its throughput is significantly lower (182 cases/day) compared to other final approval steps, suggesting potential bottlenecks in the final approval process.

### **Executive Recommendations:**

1.  **Review_Documents:** Initiate a root cause analysis to determine the specific reasons for rework and delays (SLA breaches) in document review. Identify training needs, process ambiguities, or system limitations addressing these root causes.

2.  **Request_Documents:** Analyze the 150-minute wait time bottleneck. Evaluate current verification/commsec processes and explore options like simplified pre-submission checks, automation, or resource allocation to reduce waiting time before document handling begins.

3.  **Approve_Claim:** Deploy process monitoring tools to track resource availability, case complexity, and task initiation times during the final approval stage. Specifically, analyze utilization patterns and potential workflow constraints to identify practical improvements for meeting SLA targets.
