Non-compliant

1. Rule 1: The PO amount is €12 300, exceeding the €10 000 threshold. The trace includes `Approve_PO` by a Procurement Officer and `Approve_PO_CFO` by the CFO before `Issue_PO`, satisfying the first approval condition.
2. Rule 2: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag`, so `Quality_Check` is optional. However, `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event 8 and `Risk_Assessment` at event 9. Therefore, this rule is violated.
3. Rule 3: `Goods_Received` occurs at event 6. `Three_way_match` occurs at event 10, which is a distance of 4 from `Goods_Received`. Since the distance must be ≤ 2, this rule is violated.
4. Rule 4: `Move_to_Quality` (event 7) which is performed by an Intern, directly follows `Approve_PO_CFO` (event 3) which is performed by the CFO. This does not violate Rule 4 as it says *any activity executed by the role Intern may **directly follow** an activity executed by the role CFO*
5. Rule 5: The trace ends with `Archive_Record`, and there are no events after it. This rule is satisfied.
Since Rules 2 and 3 are violated, the trace is non-compliant.
