I’m thinking about connecting nodes: Start Event → Auto classify Task → Exclusive Gateway for classify decision. For simplicity, I might model an automatic task as "System Classifies Ticket" instead of just "Ticket is automatically classified." I need to include this with a User Task for "Provide Reset Instructions" and consider a Task for "Confirm with Customer." Using Gateways is acceptable for decision points, so I’ll include them where necessary for clarity.

The phrase “If the ticket is classified as ‘Password Reset’” implies a decision. I should think about using either an Exclusive Gateway or a Decision Task. They want two decision points marked with exclusive gateways. I could use an exclusive gateway for the first classification decision between "Password Reset" and "Initial Diagnosis." The second decision could be for the agent's choice after diagnosis, leading to either "Resolve Issue" or "Forward to Specialist." I need to keep it clear and concise!

I want to make sure that the flow branches clearly, especially regarding "Resolve Issue." After Step 5, there are two paths: either "Resolve Issue" or "Forward to Specialist." When the specialist finishes, the ticket is also considered "Resolve Issue" in Step 6. To avoid duplicating task IDs for "Resolve Issue," I can use separate Task nodes with the same name. Also, the re-work loop should connect from "Confirm with Customer" to "Initial Diagnosis," as the text describes!

I see that there are two main paths for confirmation after “Resolve Issue.” If the customer confirms resolution, the ticket gets closed, but if they report that the issue persists, it loops back to “Initial Diagnosis.” I can set up the flow after "Confirm with Customer" with an exclusive gateway to handle this. We need to mark both decision points with exclusive gateways: the first for “Password Reset” and the second for after diagnosis. The connections should flow to the correct tasks based on conditions, ensuring clarity in our modeling!

The process involves multiple paths leading to "Resolve Issue." We can use separate parallel tasks for "Provide Reset Instructions" and "Confirm with Customer." It's crucial to ensure the flow correctly connects to these tasks, maintaining clarity with exclusive gateways for decision-making.

For modeling, I’ll utilize BPMN 2.0 XML format. I’ll define unique IDs for each task and gateway, ensuring compliance with execution standards. Connections will reflect the necessary paths, especially for the customer's confirmation, ensuring the final structure meets all specified requirements!

To manage the flow, I’ll create separate paths after "Initial Diagnosis" to "Resolve Issue" and "Forward to Specialist," linking them with two exclusive gateways for decision-making. The sequence flows will guide actions like confirming with customers and addressing unresolved issues.

I need to ensure that the process terminates correctly when a ticket is closed, using an End Event. The BPMN definitions will be minimal, with well-defined IDs for tasks and gateways to maintain clarity and compliance without unnecessary additions!

I need to ensure that the two exclusive gateways are correctly positioned for classification and diagnosis. The process will flow through various tasks like confirming with customers and resolving issues. I'll utilize concise IDs and ensure the structure is clear.

Since they requested a single `<definitions>` block without unnecessary XML headers or diagrams, I'll keep it straightforward and produce the final XML. I must double-check for proper semantics and ensure that the re-work loop is correctly modeled. Time to deliver the executable BPMN 2.0 XML code!
