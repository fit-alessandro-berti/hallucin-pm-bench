**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Date:** Q2 2025 Kickoff
**Subject:** Q1 Claims Handling Process Immediate Performance Review

This memo highlights the three most critical bottlenecks in the Q1 Claims Handling process:

1.  **Request Documents:** This activity is severely impeded by a massive **150-minute average wait time** and the highest rework rate (**22.0%**), strongly suggesting inefficiency in initiation or fulfillment.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement mandatory digital document submission protocols to bypass manual initiation queues.
2.  **Review Documents:** This step features the longest average execution time (**25 min**) and the highest SLA breach rate (**12.4%**), indicating complexity or insufficient reviewer expertise.
    *   **Recommendation:** Investigate the **9-minute processing standard deviation**; targeted training for reviewers could stabilize execution time substantially.
3.  **Initial Assessment:** While processing time is moderate (12 min), the **18-minute wait time** is the second highest bottleneck, contributing significantly to upstream delays.
    *   **Recommendation:** Prioritize clearing the assessment queue by either increasing resource allocation dedicated solely to triage or implementing an automated triage layer.
