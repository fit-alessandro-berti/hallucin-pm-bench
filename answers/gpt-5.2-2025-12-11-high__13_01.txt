1) **“Manual_Fraud_Check” occurrences:** **1** time.

2) **Percentage of all logged events:**  
Total events = 18, Manual_Fraud_Check = 1 → \( \frac{1}{18} \times 100 = 5.555...\% \) → **5.56%**

3) **Case identifier(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”:** **A1002**

4) **Two sampling-related reasons the monthly estimate is unreliable (using only this fragment):**
- **Time-window bias / non-representativeness:** The fragment covers only a short period on **2025-05-01** (a partial day), which may not reflect typical behavior across an entire month (day-of-week effects, promotions, operational changes, etc. are not captured here).
- **Small sample size / high variance:** Only **18 events** (and only **1** fraud-check instance) are observed; extrapolating from a single occurrence makes the monthly estimate highly unstable and sensitive to random fluctuation.
