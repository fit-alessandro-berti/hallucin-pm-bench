**Yes**, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3** in a reachable marking.

### ✅ **Shortest firing sequence** where **T5 fires before T3**:

```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```

---

### 🔍 **Step-by-step explanation (based on initial marking and net structure only):**

- **Initial marking**:  
  `p0 = 1`, all others = 0  
  → Only **T1** is enabled.

1. **Fire T1**  
   - Consumes token from `p0`  
   - Produces tokens in `pa` and `pb`  
   - New marking: `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`, others = 0  
   → Now **T2**, **T2b**, and **T4** are enabled.

2. **Fire T2b**  
   - Consumes token from `pa`  
   - Produces token in `pd`  
   - New marking: `pb = 1`, `pd = 1`, others = 0  
   → **T4** still enabled; **T3** not enabled (no token in `pc`).

3. **Fire T4**  
   - Consumes token from `pb`  
   - Produces token in `pe`  
   - New marking: `pd = 1`, `pe = 1`, others = 0  
   → **T5** is now enabled (both `pd` and `pe` have tokens).

4. **Fire T5**  
   - Consumes tokens from `pd` and `pe`  
   - Produces token in `pf`  
   - New marking: `pf = 1`, others = 0  
   → **T5 has fired**, and **T3 has not fired yet**.

At this point, **T3 has not fired at all**, and `pc = 0`. So clearly, **T5 fired before T3**.

### ✅ Conclusion:

Yes, it is possible.  
**Shortest firing sequence**:  
```
T1, T2b, T4, T5
```
