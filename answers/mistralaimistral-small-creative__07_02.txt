Here is the strict comparison of the two BPMN versions under the requested headings:

---

### **Added tasks**
1. **`Task_VerifyIdentity`** – New task added after the start event.
2. **`Task_RequestDocs`** – New task branching from the gateway (previously only "Approve Loan" or "Reject Loan").
3. **`Task_FinalReject`** – New task replacing the original "Reject Loan" task (renamed and functionally distinct).

---

### **Removed tasks**
1. **`Task_RejectLoan`** – Original task removed (replaced by `Task_FinalReject`).

---

### **Gateway-type changes**
1. **`Gateway_Decision`** – Changed from **Exclusive Gateway** to **Inclusive Gateway** (now supports multiple parallel paths instead of a single choice).
