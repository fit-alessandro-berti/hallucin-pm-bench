No.

Justification:  
The FACT states that “Validate_Payment” always occurs immediately after “Receive_Order,” with no other activities in between. However, the event log provides evidence that this is not the case for all cases.

- **C001**:  
  Sequence: Receive_Order (09:12) → Validate_Payment (09:15)  
  This matches the FACT, with Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order.

- **C002**:  
  Sequence: Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05)  
  Here, “Pack_Items” occurs after “Receive_Order” before “Validate_Payment,” so Validate_Payment is **not** immediately after Receive_Order.

- **C003**:  
  Sequence: Receive_Order (09:40) → Validate_Payment (09:44) → Ship_Order (11:00)  
  In this case, Validate_Payment occurs **immediately** after Receive_Order, satisfying the condition.

- **C004**:  
  Sequence: Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20)  
  Here, “Check_Fraud” occurs after Receive_Order, then Validate_Payment occurs later, so not immediately after.

**Conclusion:**  
Because case C002 and C004 show instances where “Validate_Payment” does **not** occur immediately after “Receive_Order,” the statement that it **always** does in this manner is incorrect.
