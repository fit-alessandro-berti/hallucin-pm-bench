**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance – Key Issues & Actions  

Three activities show the poorest performance: *Request_Documents*, *Review_Documents*, and *Initial_Assessment*.  

*Request_Documents* has the lowest throughput (190/day) and longest wait time (150 min), indicating a severe bottleneck. High rework (22%) suggests unclear or incomplete requests. **Action:** Redesign the request template based on rework data to reduce ambiguity.  

*Review_Documents* follows with low throughput (185/day), high processing time (25 min), and the highest SLA breaches (12.4%). Variability is high (stdev = 9), implying inconsistent handling. **Action:** Standardize review checklists and provide targeted training using top-performer benchmarks.  

*Initial_Assessment* shows elevated wait time (18 min) and SLA breaches (3.2%), despite moderate throughput. Its rework rate (1.8%) is the second-highest among non-document activities. **Action:** Rebalance workload from *Request_Documents* to free up capacity and reduce upstream delays.  

All other activities perform within acceptable thresholds. Focus on these three to improve end-to-end flow.
