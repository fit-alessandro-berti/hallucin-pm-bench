**No**

**Justification:**

The fact states that "Validate_Payment" *always* immediately follows "Receive_Order". This is not the case in the provided log excerpt.

*   **Case C003:** "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T09:40:00) is followed by "Validate_Payment" (2025-01-03T09:44:00). This *does* support the statement.
*   **Case C004:** "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T10:05:00) is followed by "Check_Fraud" (2025-01-03T10:07:00), *then* "Validate_Payment" (2025-01-03T10:20:00). This demonstrates that "Validate_Payment" does *not* always immediately follow "Receive_Order."
*   This also applies to Case C001 where 'Pack_Items' occurs between 'Receive_Order' and 'Validate_Payment'.
