The user is asking me to analyze Process B (Warehouse_Replenishment) and identify the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently. They specifically want to know about tasks that lie on different branches of the same parallel gateway (parallel splits).

Looking at Process B structure:

1. Start
2. Receive_Stock
3. || Parallel Split #1 ||
   • Quality_Check
   • Update_Inventory
4. || Merge #1 ||
5. Store_Items
6. || Parallel Split #2 ||
   • Generate_Replenishment_Report
   • Notify_Procurement
7. || Merge #2 ||
8. End

I need to identify concurrent sets based on the parallel gateways:

1. First parallel gateway (Parallel Split #1) has two branches:
   - Quality_Check
   - Update_Inventory

   So Set 1: {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory}

2. Second parallel gateway (Parallel Split #2) has two branches:
   - Generate_Replenishment_Report
   - Notify_Procurement

   So Set 2: {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}

These are the only parallel splits in Process B. The other tasks (Receive_Stock, Store_Items) are sequential and don't involve parallel execution.

Note: The || Merge #1 || and || Merge #2 || are just synchronization points that don't enable concurrency themselves.

I'll present these two sets in the requested format.
For Process B - Warehouse_Replenishment, the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently are:

1. {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory}  
   - Located after Parallel Split #1
   - These two tasks execute in parallel before merging at Merge #1

2. {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}  
   - Located after Parallel Split #2
   - These two tasks execute in parallel before merging at Merge #2

Note: The other tasks (Receive_Stock, Store_Items) are performed sequentially and do not run concurrently with other tasks.
