**Answer: Yes**

**Justification:**  
- Rule 1 is satisfied: both QE and RA occur once each in the correct order.  
- Rule 2 is satisfied: with high severity, VP_Safety_Approval (VP) occurs after both QE and RA.  
- Rule 3 is met: NP begins after both QE and RA are complete.  
- Rule 4 is met: CC occurs after both QE and RA (and, if applicable, after VP).  

All trace activities respect the recall-handling ruleset.
