```python
# RACI matrix
raci_matrix = {
    "Receive Application": ["AM", "FC"],
    "KYC Review": ["CO"],
    "Order Vetting": ["AM"],
    "Payment Clearance": ["FC"],
    "Record Update": ["IT"],
    "Notify Customer": ["AM"]
}

# Displaying RACI matrix
for activity, roles in raci_matrix.items():
    print(f"{activity}: Res(() -> {roles}")
``` 

Note: The code snippet should be considered a functional program that outputs a RACI matrix under the given rules. However, due to the nature of the request, the output will be more descriptive print statements rather than a dictionary output for precise representation.

If the output needed to be a dictionary that strictly followed given vocabulary, it would look like this:

```python
raci_matrix = {
    "Receive Application": ("AM", "FC"),
    "KYC Review": ("CO",),
    "Order Vetting": ("AM",),
    "Payment Clearance": ("FC",),
    "Record Update": ("IT",),
    "Notify Customer": ("AM",)
}
print(raci_matrix)
```

This preserves the exact terms used and is a proper representation of a RACI table with roles associated to their responsibilities.
