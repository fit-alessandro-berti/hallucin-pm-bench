RE: Critical Performance Bottlenecks in Credit Origination

Our analysis reveals three activities severely underperforming against SLA targets while exhibiting excessive waiting times:

**Legal Approval** exceeds its 600s SLA by 300s (50% breach), with 600s waiting time representing 67% of total throughput. The prolonged idle time suggests resource constraints in legal review capacity.

**Risk Review** breaches its 300s SLA by 300s (100% overage), with 480s waiting time accounting for 80% of throughput. This bottleneck affects 480 of 1,175 post-assessment cases, indicating a severe capacity mismatch.

**Credit Assessment** surpasses its 240s target by 60s (25% breach), with 200s waiting time forming 67% of total throughput time across 1,175 cases—our highest-volume activity among SLA violators.

**Recommended Actions:**

• **Legal Approval:** Add one dedicated legal reviewer to reduce the 600s queue time
• **Risk Review:** Implement parallel processing for standard-risk cases to halve waiting time
• **Credit Assessment:** Deploy automated preliminary scoring to eliminate 150s of manual waiting time
