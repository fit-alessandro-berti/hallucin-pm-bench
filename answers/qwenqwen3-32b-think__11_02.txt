**Memo: Q1 2025 Claims Handling Performance Analysis**  

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** [Your Name], Senior Process-Performance Analyst  

**Worst-performing activities and recommendations:**  

1. **Request Documents**  
   - **Issues**: Highest average wait time (150 min), 22% rework, and 5.5% SLA breaches.  
   - **Recommendation**: Increase capacity (e.g., hires/automation) and implement customer guidance tools pre-submission to reduce errors and rework.  

2. **Review Documents**  
   - **Issues**: Longest processing time (25 min), high variability (9-min stdev), and 12.4% SLA breaches.  
   - **Recommendation**: Streamline document verification steps and standardize decision rules to cut processing time and variability.  

3. **Initial Assessment**  
   - **Issues**: High wait time (18 min) and 3.2% SLA breaches; throughput lags registration (270 vs. 280 case/day).  
   - **Recommendation**: Deploy predictive triage to prioritize complex claims and reallocate resources to balance workload.  

All three bottlenecks hinder end-to-end flow. Prioritize fixes in **Request/Review Documents**, as their delays cascade into downstream SLA compliance and customer satisfaction.
