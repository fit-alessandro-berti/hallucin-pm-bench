## Answer: **No**

The FACT is **not accurate**. At least two cases directly contradict it.

### Evidence from the log

| CaseID | Actual sequence | Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order? |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| C001 | Receive_Order → **Validate_Payment** → Pack_Items | ✅ Yes |
| C002 | Receive_Order → **Pack_Items** → Validate_Payment | ❌ No – *Pack_Items* intervenes |
| C003 | Receive_Order → **Validate_Payment** → Ship_Order | ✅ Yes |
| C004 | Receive_Order → **Check_Fraud** → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items | ❌ No – *Check_Fraud* intervenes |

---

### Justification

- **C002** inserts `Pack_Items` *between* `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, breaking the claimed direct succession.  
- **C004** inserts `Check_Fraud` *between* `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, again violating the stated rule.

Because the relationship does **not hold in all cases**, the FACT is **incorrect**.
