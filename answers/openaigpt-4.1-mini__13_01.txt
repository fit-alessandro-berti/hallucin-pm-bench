1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs exactly **1** time in this fragment.

2. There are 18 log lines in total. The single occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check" represents \(\frac{1}{18} \times 100 \approx 5.56\%\) of all logged events.

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why using this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable:  
   - The fragment covers only a **single day** (2025-05-01) and not the entire month, so it may not represent typical daily or monthly patterns.  
   - The fragment contains only **4 distinct cases**, which is a very small sample size and may not capture the variability or true frequency of manual fraud checks across all orders in the month.
