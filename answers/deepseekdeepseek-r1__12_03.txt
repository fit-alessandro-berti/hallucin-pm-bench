1. **No**  
2. The FACT is incorrect because:  
- **CaseID C002** has the sequence: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment. Here, *Pack_Items* occurs between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*.  
- **CaseID C004** has the sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment. Here, *Check_Fraud* intervenes between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*.  

These deviations show that *Validate_Payment* does **not** always immediately follow *Receive_Order* in the log.
