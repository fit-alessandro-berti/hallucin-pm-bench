1️⃣ The activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time (Case 1002).

2️⃣ Because the provided excerpt focuses specifically on Case 1002, it creates a bias. Analysts seeing only this snippet might assume manual checks are a frequent or standard part of the workflow, overlooking that Cases 1001 and 1003 utilized "Automatic" checks to progress immediately. This limited view creates a false impression that manual intervention is a required norm, whereas in the full log, it is likely a rare exception.
