### Decision Points

Based on the defined process, the following decision points govern the flow:

1.  **Eligibility Validation** (`Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility`): The triage agent decides whether the claim is valid based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.
2.  **Finance Pre-Approval** (`Finance_Controller_PreApprove`): The finance controller decides whether to sign off using the *EligibilityChecklist*. **Process_Refund_Payment** cannot begin unless this decision succeeds.
3.  **High-Value Assessment** (`High-value branch`): A conditional check on the refund amount.
    *   **If > €1,000**: The case must proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review**.
    *   **If ≤ €1,000**: The case proceeds directly to payment (once pre-approval is secured).
