**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Chief Operating Officer  
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**RE:** Critical Process Performance Issues

Our credit processing pipeline shows three activities critically underperforming against SLA targets, creating significant operational bottlenecks.

**Risk Review** presents our most severe challenge, exceeding its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds (600s actual) while experiencing 480 seconds of waiting time across 480 cases. **Legal Approval** follows closely, surpassing its 600-second target by 300 seconds (900s actual) with 600 seconds waiting time affecting 465 cases. **Credit Assessment** rounds out our problem areas, exceeding its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds (300s actual) with 200 seconds waiting time impacting 1,175 cases.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
• **Risk Review:** Deploy additional risk analysts to reduce the 480-second waiting time bottleneck
• **Legal Approval:** Implement parallel legal review workflows to address the 600-second waiting time constraint  
• **Credit Assessment:** Automate preliminary credit scoring to eliminate 200 seconds of waiting time for our highest-volume activity

These interventions will restore SLA compliance and improve customer experience.
