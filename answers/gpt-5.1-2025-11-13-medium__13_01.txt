1. “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs **1** time in this fragment.  

2. Total events = 18.  
   Percentage = \( \frac{1}{18} \times 100 \approx 5.56\% \).  

3. Case identifiers containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”: **A1002**.  

4. Two sampling-related reasons the monthly estimate is unreliable (given only this fragment):  
   - **Small sample size**: only 4 cases and 18 events, with just 1 occurrence of “Manual_Fraud_Check”, so any frequency estimate has very high statistical uncertainty.  
   - **Non-representative time window**: all events are from a single short period on 2025-05-01 (roughly 09:00–14:05) and may not reflect behavior over different days/times in the month (e.g., other days, weekends, peak periods are not observed).
