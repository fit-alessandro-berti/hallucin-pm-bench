1) Cannot compute the average cycle time in hours for the activity “Approve Invoice” because Artefact A contains only the header of the event log; there are no data rows with activity names or timestamps to derive durations.

2) Consequently, I cannot provide a standard deviation or a 95% confidence interval since there is no sample of durations. To compute them, we would need, for every occurrence of “Approve Invoice,” the start_time and complete_time to form per-event durations, from which the mean, standard deviation, and CI could be derived.

3) The precise reason: the supplied log artefact is redacted to the point that no case records or timestamp values are present; without any per-event timing data for “Approve Invoice,” no metric can be computed. (No external knowledge may be used.)
