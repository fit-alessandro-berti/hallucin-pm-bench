a) Decision points in Acme’s small-business loan process  
1. Conditional skip of manual underwriting (after Tri-Color-Risk-Check): if the risk rating comes back Low or Medium AND the applicant’s requested amount is €250 000 or less, then step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review) is skipped; otherwise you proceed to manual underwriting.  
2. TriVote decision gate (step 6): the loan passes this gate if at least two of the three—Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer—approve; fewer than two approvals means it fails.
