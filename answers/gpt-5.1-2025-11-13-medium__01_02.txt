**Decision points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track process**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   - Compares the risk scores from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**.  
   - If the two scores differ by **≤ 2 points** → proceed directly to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.  
   - If the two scores differ by **> 2 points** → escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision, then proceed to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   - If **amount < €15 000** → the system **auto-approves** after **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.  
   - If **amount ≥ €15 000** → proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**  
   - The **Micro-loan Board** votes **approve** or **reject** for amounts **≥ €15 000**.  
   - On approval → proceed to **Disburse Funds**.  
   - On rejection → no disbursement.
