To answer the questions based on the provided XES event log fragment:

Q1: To find the number of distinct cases, we look at the `case` attribute in each event line. The cases mentioned are C001, C002, and C003. Thus, there are **3 distinct cases** present in this fragment.

Q2: For case "C002", we need to list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred. The events related to C002 are:
- `<event case="C002" concept:name="Receive_Order"     time:timestamp="2025-03-01T09:15:10"/>`
- `<event case="C002" concept:name="Check_Stock"       time:timestamp="2025-03-01T09:22:55"/>`
- `<event case="C002" concept:name="Arrange_Delivery"  time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:15:20"/>`
- `<event case="C002" concept:name="Ship_Order"       time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:25:40"/>`

So, the sequence of activities for case "C002" is: 
`Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`

Q3: To find every distinct activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" across all cases, we look at the events leading up to "Ship_Order" for each case:
- For C001: `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order`.
- For C002: `Arrange_Delivery` precedes `Ship_Order`.
- For C003: `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order`.

Thus, the distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
1. Arrange_Delivery
2. Check_Stock

These are listed one per line, in alphabetical order.
