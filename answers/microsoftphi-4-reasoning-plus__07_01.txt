We are a "meticulous BPMN change-log analyst". We are provided with two BPMN XML snippets. Our output must be a summary of changes, grouped by:

- Added tasks
- Removed tasks
- Gateway type changes

We want to list only the factual differences that can be read from the given BPMN version (if known). We are not allowed to speculate about anything not present in the snippet. So the process is RMA process.

Let's analyze the provided XML snippets:

BPMN_v1 has:
Let's restate v1:
```
<startEvent id="start"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f1" sourceRef="start" targetRef="receive_request"/>
<task id="receive_request" name="Receive Return Request"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f2" sourceRef="receive_request" targetRef="validate_warranty"/>
<task id="validate_warranty" name="Validate Warranty"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f3" sourceRef="validate_warranty" targetRef="gw_valid"/>
<exclusiveGateway id="gw_valid" name="Warranty Valid?"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f4" sourceRef="gw_valid" targetRef="approve_return"/>
<task id="approve_return" name="Approve Return"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f5" sourceRef="approve_return" targetRef="send_rma_label"/>
<task id="send_rma_label" name="Send RMA Label"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f6" sourceRef="send_rma_label" targetRef="end"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f7" sourceRef="gw_valid" targetRef="reject_return"/>
<task id="reject_return" name="Reject Return"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f8" sourceRef="reject_return" targetRef="end"/>
<endEvent id="end"/>
```
BPMN_v2's snippet is:
```
<startEvent id="start"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f1" sourceRef="start" targetRef="receive_request"/>
<task id="receive_request" name="Receive Return Request"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f2" sourceRef="receive_request" targetRef="check_vip"/>
<task id="check_vip"   name="Check Customer VIP Status"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f3" sourceRef="check_vip" targetRef="validate_warranty"/>
<task id="validate_warranty" name="Validate Warranty"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f4" sourceRef="validate_warranty" targetRef="gw_valid"/>
<inclusiveGateway id="gw_valid" name="Warranty Valid?"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f5" sourceRef="gw_valid" targetRef="approve_return"/>
<task id="approve_return" name="Approve Return"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f6" sourceRef="approve_return" targetRef="generate_qr"/>
<task id="generate_qr"  name="Generate RMA QR Code"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f7" sourceRef="generate_qr" targetRef="end"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f8" sourceRef="gw_valid" targetRef="reject_return"/>
<task id="reject_return" name="Reject Return"/>
<sequenceFlow id="f9" sourceRef="reject_return" targetRef="end"/>
<endEvent id="end"/>
```
So differences:
1. Compare tasks:
   - version 1 tasks: "receive_request", "validate_warranty", "approve_return", "send_rma_label", "reject_return".
   - version 2 tasks: "receive_request", "check_vip", "validate_warranty", "approve_return", "generate_qr", "reject_return".
Hence tasks that are in version 2 but not in v1: check_vip task, generate_qr task.
Extra tasks in version 2: "check_vip", "generate_qr" must be added tasks.
Now, what tasks are in version 1 but are not in version 2? "send_rma_label" task snippet appears. Therefore that was removed/out in version 2.

So under "Added tasks", we have:
- check_vip (with id "check_vip")

- generate_qr (with id "generate_qr")

"Removed tasks": 
- send_rma_label (with id "send_rma_label") is removed. Because v2 lacks task "send_rma_label". It's clearly removed. (Because find in v2 generate qr and then ending event)
We check others if any tasks removed: "receive_request", "validate_warranty", "reject_return" all are common but "approve_return" remains common. "check_vip" added is not present in v1. "generate_qr" has been added as step. So yes.

Also "sequence flows" changed, but not in our categories. Also "gateway changes":

2. Compare theGateway element:
   In BPMN_v1, we have: <exclusiveGateway id="gw_valid" name="Warranty Valid?"/>
   In BPMN_v2, we have: <inclusiveGateway id="gw_valid" name="Warranty Valid?"/> which basically changed the gateway type from exclusive to inclusive.
So additional gateway "gw_valid" type changed. And check if there are any extra gateways or changes? Let's check id attributes: The id "gw_valid" remains, but type changed from exclusive to inclusive.

So under heading "Gateway type changes", we output: "gw_valid: changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway."

Often we need to group under exactly headings and then bullet list. Must list category "Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway type changes" with exactly that heading heading and then items. If category has no items, we must write " (none) " if empty. So if we have no tasks for a category, then (none). But our categories changed: we found two differences in tasks, and one difference in gateway property.

We must only output the above differences with no extra commentary.

But ensure that "added tasks" and "removed tasks" categories - list the tasks with "element names exactly as they appear" So exactly, they are thing "task id" with names? We must list "check_vip", "generate_qr" for Added tasks, input text exactly from the snippet "task id". We must list removed "send_rma_label" if not present.

I must list all differences exactly as bullet list under headings:
"Added tasks" heading, list "check_vip" and "generate_qr"

"Removed tasks" heading: "send_rma_label" task removed.

"Gateway type changes" heading: "gw_valid changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway" I should write: used task names exactly: "gateway type changes: gw_valid changed from exclusive to inclusive", but must use the element names exactly as they appear in XML. So we have gateways: In BPMN_v1: <exclusiveGateway id="gw_valid" name="..."/>
BPMN_v2: <inclusiveGateway id="gw_valid" name="..."/>
Thus output: change: "gw_valid": changed from "exclusiveGateway" to "inclusiveGateway."

We can say: It appears as " gw_valid: exclusive -> inclusive " etc.

I must not speculate any thing about missing items. Those are all.

Double-check: In BPMN_v1, tasks: receive_request, validate_warranty, approve_return, send_rma_label, reject_return. In BPMN_v2 tasks: receive_request, check_vip, validate_warranty, approve_return, generate_qr, reject_return.
So v2 has extra tasks: check_vip and generate_qr, v2 have removed task send_rma_label (which exists in v1). Also I see v1 does not have a startTask "f1". But that's a flow. But our category of tasks is only about tasks. SequenceFlow differences are not asked. We are not checking "removed" sequence flows. 
Let me check: in BPMN_v1, handshake flow: after approve_return, v1 had a flow sequenceFlow to "send_rma_label" and subsequently "end". In BPMN_v2, after approve_return, v2 flows to "generate_qr". And "generate_qr" goes directly to end? Yes.

So no further differences.

Also differences in gateway: in BPMN_v1: "gw_valid" is defined as an exclusiveGateway. In BPMN_v2: defined as "gw_valid" with type inclusiveGateway. So that's the gateway type change. 
We want to output the "gateway type change" fact: "gw_valid" changed its type from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway.

I must also include that if no differences in a category, I must output "(none)".
So I have no differences under other headings than base differences of tasks and gateway. There's no others asked.

Now I must output my result under headings exactly as described: "Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway type changes".

We note that tasks "receive_request", "validate_warranty", "approve_return", "reject_return" are constant across versions so they don't appear as differences.

Also the id "start" remains same. Also "end" remains same.

Now check if additional tasks might be also inserted inside the process. Yes, "check_vip" and "generate_qr" added, and "send_rma_label" removed.

I have identified differences. 

Thus final answer:

Added tasks:
- task id "check_vip"
- task id "generate_qr"

Removed tasks:
- task id "send_rma_label"

Gateway type changes:
- "gw_valid" changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway.

I must output exactly.

Thus my answer text must be:

"
Added tasks:
• check_vip
• generate_qr

Removed tasks:
• send_rma_label

Gateway type changes:
• gw_valid: changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway
"

I must write in our answer that it's only the differences that are factual.

I must output exactly listing them as group.

I must group them under headings exactly: 
"• Added tasks" etc.

Let's check if the question formatting is exactly: "Group your answer under the exact headings: • Added tasks • Removed tasks • Gateway type changes." Must be in our answer exactly with the bullet headings.

I must check the formatting instructions: "Use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML." So yes.

We might reference them as tasks "receive_vip" is from the element id. But not exactly because id is "check_vip", so it's explicitly "check_vip".

Also answer: "Gateway type changes" category. Under that group, " gw_valid changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway".

I must print no additional commentary. After that, I must provide final answer. Also must include that if category has no differences, output "(none)". I output only textual differences, no mention of sequence flows because the instruction is only tasks and gateways; no mention outputs additional differences.

I must produce that answer. So I'll produce final answer as requested.

I'll double-check:
- Are there any differences for tasks that are "modified", not added or removed? Only check synopsis: "receive_request" is same. However, check VIP and check QR differences? So using our instructions to check tasks exactly. So answer precisely.

I'll produce final answer: "Added tasks: check_vip, generate_qr; Removed tasks: send_rma_label; Gateway type changes: gw_valid changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway." 
I'll then output the same text.

Alright I'll now produce final answer accordingly. We'll produce final answer text formatting as required. We'll produce each group with bullet lines starting with bullet point bullet characters exactly as headings. Therefore: 
```
• Added tasks
    - check_vip
    - generate_qr
• Removed tasks
    - send_rma_label
• Gateway type changes
    - gw_valid changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway
```

I'll produce remedy. In my answer I'll produce text as requested.

I'll produce the answer as a plain text with headings bullet lines:

I'll produce final answer below.

I'll now produce final answer.• Added tasks
- check_vip
- generate_qr

• Removed tasks
- send_rma_label

• Gateway type changes
- gw_valid changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway
