### Summary

The decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process are:

1. The triage agent validates the claim’s eligibility using the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.
2. The finance controller pre-approves the claim based on the *EligibilityChecklist*.
3. After pre-approval, a decision is made based on the refund amount:
   - If the refund exceeds €1,000, the process proceeds to the *Senior_Auditor_Review*, which requires the *AuditTrail*.
   - Otherwise, the process skips the auditor review and proceeds directly to refund payment.

**Documents Required:**
All required documents across the process are:

1. RefundRequestForm
2. FlightManifest
3. WeatherReport
4. EligibilityChecklist
5. AuditTrail
6. BankTransferAuthorization
7. RefundConfirmationPDF

The only explicit decision point with branching is the check on the refund amount, which determines whether the senior auditor review is necessary. Other steps involve validation and approval, which implicitly decide whether to continue or terminate the process, though alternative paths are not detailed.

However, in business process modeling, any step where the process flow can diverge based on a condition is considered a decision point. Therefore, the validation and approval steps are also decision points where the process can potentially terminate if the conditions are not met.

Thus, the decision points are:

1. Validation of eligibility by the triage agent.
2. Pre-approval by the finance controller.
3. High-value decision (whether the refund is greater than €1,000).

All required documents are listed above.
