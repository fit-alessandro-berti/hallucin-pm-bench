Based on my comparison of the two BPMN XML versions, here are all the changes:

## Added tasks
- **Task_VerifyIdentity** ("Verify Identity") - inserted between Start and Review Application
- **Task_RequestDocs** ("Request Additional Documents") - new path from the gateway
- **Task_FinalReject** ("Final Reject") - replaces the previous Reject Loan task with a new ID

## Removed tasks  
- **Task_RejectLoan** ("Reject Loan") - removed and replaced by Task_FinalReject

## Gateway-type changes
- **Gateway_Decision** changed from **exclusiveGateway** to **inclusiveGateway** - this allows multiple outgoing paths to be taken simultaneously rather than just one exclusive path
