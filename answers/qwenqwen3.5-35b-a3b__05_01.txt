Attach a **Timer Boundary Event** to `Task_RequestDocs`. Configure the timer with a 48-hour duration. Create a new outgoing sequence flow from this event directly to `Task_Triage`. 

This ensures that if document collection takes too long, the process bypasses the standard completion path and forces the claim into `Task_Triage`, satisfying the 48-hour SLA. This effectively auto-escalates the workflow state to Triage without adding new tasks, prioritizing the deadline over document completeness. The original flows handle timely completions normally. This change uses only events and flow modifications, adhering to constraints while guaranteeing claims reach `Task_Triage` within the required timeframe. Element IDs used: `Task_RequestDocs`, `Task_Triage`.
