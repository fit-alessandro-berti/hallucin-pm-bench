I'll analyze case #47291 against each compliance rule:

**R1. Any purchase order with total_amount > €10,000 must have Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval.**
**Compliant** - Manager_Approval (event 2) occurred before Finance_Approval (event 3) for €12,450 order.

**R2. If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval.**
**Compliant** - Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) occurred within 2 days of Finance_Approval (2025-03-04 08:17).

**R3. Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods.**
**Violated** - Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) occurred before Receive_Goods (2025-03-07).

**R4. If hazardous = true, a Safety_Inspection must occur after Receive_Goods and before Store_Goods.**
**Not Applicable** - hazardous = false for this case.

**R5. If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step.**
**Violated** - Ship_Goods (event 5) occurred after Change_Request without new Manager_Approval first.

**R6. Every case must terminate with Archive_Record.**
**Compliant** - Case ends with Archive_Record (event 10).

**NON-COMPLIANT**
