1. No

2. The FACT is not accurate. Let's examine the case sequences:

*   **Case C001:** Receive\_Order (09:12:00) -> Validate\_Payment (09:15:00) -> Pack\_Items (10:00:00)
*   **Case C002:** Receive\_Order (09:30:00) -> Pack\_Items (09:50:00) -> Validate\_Payment (10:05:00)
*   **Case C003:** Receive\_Order (09:40:00) -> Validate\_Payment (09:44:00) -> Ship\_Order (11:00:00)
*   **Case C004:** Receive\_Order (10:05:00) -> Check\_Fraud (10:07:00) -> Validate\_Payment (10:20:00) -> Pack\_Items (10:45:00)

As these sequences demonstrate, “Validate\_Payment” does not consistently occur immediately after “Receive\_Order.” There are instances of other activities (Pack\_Items, Check\_Fraud) occurring between the two.
