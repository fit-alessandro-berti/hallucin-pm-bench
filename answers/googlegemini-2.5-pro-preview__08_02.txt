**Question 1.** Yes.

**Question 2.** A minimal firing sequence is: `[T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]`

T1 fires: M = {P1:1, P2:1}. T3 is now enabled (needs P2).
Then, T2 fires: M = {P2:1, P3:1}.
Then, T7 fires: M = {P2:1, P4:1}.
Then, T4 fires: M = {P2:1, P5:1}.
Now, T5 is enabled (needs P2, P5) and fires, consuming the token from P2.
M = {P6:1}.
T3 did not fire before T5 because T5 consumed the token from P2 which T3 also required.
