No. T3 and T5 are in structural conflict over place P2. T1 produces exactly one token in P2, which both transitions require as input. Since the net contains no loops to replenish P2, consuming this token for one transition permanently disables the other. Thus, T3 and T5 are mutually exclusive. While T5 can fire without T3 (e.g., sequence T1, T2, T7, T4, T5), it cannot fire *before* T3 in any valid trace where T3 also occurs, because T5's firing consumes the token necessary for T3.
