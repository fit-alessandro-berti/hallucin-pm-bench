**Answer:** No.

**Justification:**
The FACT states that the activity "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," with no other activities in between. However, the event-log excerpt shows that this is not the case.

- For CaseID C001, the sequence of activities is:
  - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T09:12:00
  - Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T09:15:00
  - Pack_Items at 2025-01-03T10:00:00

- For CaseID C002, the sequence of activities is:
  - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T09:30:00
  - Pack_Items at 2025-01-03T09:50:00
  - Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T10:05:00

- For CaseID C003, the sequence of activities is:
  - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T09:40:00
  - Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T09:44:00
  - Ship_Order at 2025-01-03T11:00:00

- For CaseID C004, the sequence of activities is:
  - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T10:05:00
  - Check_Fraud at 2025-01-03T10:07:00
  - Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T10:20:00
  - Pack_Items at 2025-01-03T10:45:00

From the provided log, it is evident that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order" without any other activities in between. Therefore, the FACT is incorrect.
