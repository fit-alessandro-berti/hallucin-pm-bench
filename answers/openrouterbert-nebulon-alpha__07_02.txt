Here is the summary of changes, strictly grouped under the requested headings:

### **Added tasks**
- `Task_VerifyIdentity` ("Verify Identity")
- `Task_RequestDocs` ("Request Additional Documents")
- `Task_FinalReject` ("Final Reject")

### **Removed tasks**
- `Task_RejectLoan` ("Reject Loan")

### **Gateway-type changes**
- **Exclusive Gateway → Inclusive Gateway**:
  `Gateway_Decision` ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check") now allows multiple outgoing paths to be taken simultaneously (e.g., both "eligible" and "missing docs" could theoretically be triggered, though the process logic suggests mutually exclusive conditions in practice).
