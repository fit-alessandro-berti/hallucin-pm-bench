**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** Chief Operating Officer, Orion Credit
**From:** Process Performance Analytics
**Subject:** Critical SLA Breaches — Immediate Action Required

Three activities are jointly failing their SLA targets and accumulating disproportionate waiting time, creating the greatest drag on end-to-end cycle performance.

**Risk Review** averages 600 seconds against a 300-second SLA — a 300-second (100%) overrun — with 480 seconds of that total consumed by waiting alone, indicating severe queue congestion.

**Legal Approval** averages 900 seconds against a 600-second SLA — a 300-second (50%) overrun — with 600 seconds attributable to waiting, the highest waiting time across all recorded activities.

**Credit Assessment** averages 300 seconds against a 240-second SLA — a 60-second (25%) overrun — with 200 of those seconds spent waiting, signalling a chronic upstream bottleneck feeding into the two activities above.

Recommended actions:

- **Credit Assessment:** Introduce automated pre-scoring rules to reduce the 200-second waiting time by triaging low-complexity cases before manual review begins.
- **Risk Review:** Assign a dedicated reviewer pool exclusively to the 480 cases reaching this stage, directly targeting the 480-second waiting time that accounts for 80% of total throughput time.
- **Legal Approval:** Implement concurrent legal review tracks — running in parallel with late-stage Risk Review — to absorb the 600-second waiting time rather than queuing it sequentially.
