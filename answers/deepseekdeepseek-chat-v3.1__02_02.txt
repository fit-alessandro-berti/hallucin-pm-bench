Let's analyze the XES event log fragment step by step to answer each question.

### Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?
We look at the `case` attribute in each event:
- Line 1: case="C001"
- Line 2: case="C002"
- Line 3: case="C001"
- Line 4: case="C003"
- Line 5: case="C002"
- Line 6: case="C003"
- Line 7: case="C001"
- Line 8: case="C002"
- Line 9: case="C003"
- Line 10: case="C002"

The distinct cases are C001, C002, and C003. So, there are **3 distinct cases**.

**Answer for Q1:**  
3

### Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).
We extract all events for case "C002" in the order of their timestamps:
- Line 2: concept:name="Receive_Order" at 2025-03-01T09:15:10
- Line 5: concept:name="Check_Stock" at 2025-03-01T09:22:55
- Line 8: concept:name="Arrange_Delivery" at 2025-03-01T10:15:20
- Line 10: concept:name="Ship_Order" at 2025-03-01T10:25:40

So the sequence is: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

**Answer for Q2:**  
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

### Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

We need to find for each occurrence of "Ship_Order", what activity came just before it in the same case.

First, list all "Ship_Order" events:
- Line 7: case="C001" (Ship_Order)
- Line 9: case="C003" (Ship_Order)
- Line 10: case="C002" (Ship_Order)

Now, for each case, find the immediate predecessor of "Ship_Order":

- For case C001 (Ship_Order at line 7):
  - Previous event in C001: line 3 (Check_Stock) at 2025-03-01T09:20:05
  - So, "Check_Stock" precedes "Ship_Order" in C001.

- For case C003 (Ship_Order at line 9):
  - Previous event in C003: line 6 (Check_Stock) at 2025-03-01T09:25:05
  - So, "Check_Stock" precedes "Ship_Order" in C003.

- For case C002 (Ship_Order at line 10):
  - Previous event in C002: line 8 (Arrange_Delivery) at 2025-03-01T10:15:20
  - So, "Arrange_Delivery" precedes "Ship_Order" in C002.

The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are: "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock".

Now, alphabetically ordered:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

**Answer for Q3:**  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock

### Final Answers:
**Q1**  
3  

**Q2**  
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  

**Q3**  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
