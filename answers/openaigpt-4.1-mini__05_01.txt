Add an intermediate timer boundary event with a 48-hour duration on the **Task_Check** (id="Task_Check"). Configure it so if the timer triggers before completion of Task_Check, the process bypasses normal flow and connects directly from this timer event to **Task_Triage** (id="Task_Triage") to ensure escalation. This enforces that if "Check Completeness" takes too long, the claim moves immediately to triage, meeting the SLA without creating new tasks. No other changes are required.
