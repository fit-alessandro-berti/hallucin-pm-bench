Add an **interrupting boundary timer event** to **`Task_RequestDocs`** that fires **48 hours after the claim is submitted** (e.g., `timeDuration = PT48H`, using the submission timestamp captured at `Start_Claim`). On timeout, route the timer’s outgoing sequence flow **directly to `Task_Triage`** (same target as `f6`) and set an **“escalated=true”** flag (data/condition) so triage knows it’s an auto-escalation.  

This prevents the process from waiting indefinitely for missing documents and guarantees every instance reaches **`Task_Triage`** within the 48‑hour SLA.
