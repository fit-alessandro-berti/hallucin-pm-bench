### Explanation of Changes
1. **Added tasks**  
   - `Task_VerifyIdentity`: New task inserted after the start event.  
   - `Task_RequestDocs`: New task triggered by the "missing docs" path from the gateway.  
   - `Task_FinalReject`: New task for handling ineligible applications (replaces the original rejection path).  

2. **Removed tasks**  
   - `Task_RejectLoan`: Direct rejection task removed; replaced by the new `Task_FinalReject` and `Task_RequestDocs` paths.  

3. **Gateway-type changes**  
   - `Gateway_Decision` transitions from an **Exclusive Gateway** (v1) to an **Inclusive Gateway** (v2):  
     - v1: Binary decision ("yes"/"no") to approve/reject.  
     - v2: Ternary decision ("eligible"/"missing docs"/"ineligible") allowing parallel execution of multiple paths (e.g., approving while requesting documents).  

**Note**: Cosmetic renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", "Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check") and XML reordering are ignored as per requirements.
