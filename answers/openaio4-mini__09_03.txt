I’m unable to compute the average cycle time, its standard deviation or a 95 % confidence interval for “Approve Invoice” because the log stub contains only column headers and no actual timestamp or case data. Without the start_time and complete_time values for each case of that activity, no cycle‐time calculations are possible.
