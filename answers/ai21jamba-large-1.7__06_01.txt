Here are the pairs of tasks in **Process B** that can be executed in parallel:

`Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check`  
`Fabricate  —  Quality_Check`  
`Fabricate  —  Procure_Materials`  
`Fabricate  —  Schedule_Machines`  
`Procure_Materials  —  Quality_Check`  
`Schedule_Machines  —  Quality_Check`

These pairs follow the conditions described in **Process B**, where tasks are explicitly stated to run in parallel or where there is no dependency preventing simultaneous execution.
