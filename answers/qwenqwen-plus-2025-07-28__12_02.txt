No

The fact is inaccurate because in case C003 (lines 6 and 7), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 2025-02-01T10:43:00Z, **before** *Receive_Order* at 2025-02-01T10:45:00Z, violating the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order*. Similarly, in case C005 (lines 11 and 12), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 2025-02-01T12:00:00Z but is not followed by *Receive_Order* at all, further contradicting the claim. Therefore, the sequence does not hold universally across all cases in the log.
