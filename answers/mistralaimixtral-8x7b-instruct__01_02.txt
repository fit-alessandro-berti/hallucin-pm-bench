The decision points in Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track process are:

1. Quick KYC Verification (KYC) - confirm ID card and mobile phone, skipping all credit history checks.
2. Community Impact Assessment (CIA) by an Impact Officer.
3. Dual Underwriter Split - both Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B independently assign a risk score (0-9).
4. Underwriter Alignment Gate - if the two scores differ by more than 2 points, the Harmonisation Committee makes a tie-break decision.
5. Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC) - collect at least 3 local references.
6. Amount Threshold Decision - if the amount is less than €15,000, the system auto-approves; if it's equal to or greater than €15,000, the Micro-loan Board makes a final approval decision.

The required documents at submission time are:

1. Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
2. Proof of Address (not older than 3 months)
3. Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
