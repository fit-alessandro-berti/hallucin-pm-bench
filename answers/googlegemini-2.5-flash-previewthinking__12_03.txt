No.

The FACT is not accurate based on the event log excerpt.

**Justification:**

The log contains instances where other activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":

*   In **Case C002**, the sequence is **Receive_Order** -> Pack_Items -> Validate_Payment. The activity "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".
*   In **Case C004**, the sequence is **Receive_Order** -> Check_Fraud -> Validate_Payment. The activity "Check_Fraud" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".
