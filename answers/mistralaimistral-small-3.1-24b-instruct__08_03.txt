To determine whether transition **T5** can fire before transition **T3**, we need to analyze the behavior of the Petri net based on the given structure and initial marking.

### Initial Marking:
- `p0 = 1`
- All other places are `0`.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The only marked place is `p0`.

2. **Firing Transition T1**:
   - Input: `p0`
   - Output: `pa, pb`
   - Resulting marking: `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`.

3. **Firing Transition T4**:
   - Input: `pb`
   - Output: `pe`
   - Resulting marking: `pa = 1`, `pe = 1`.

4. **Firing Transition T2b**:
   - Input: `pa`
   - Output: `pd`
   - Resulting marking: `pe = 1`, `pd = 1`.

5. **Firing Transition T5**:
   - Input: `pd, pe`
   - Output: `pf`
   - Resulting marking: `pf = 1`.

At this point, we observe that `T5` can fire. However, transition `T3` has not fired yet. Therefore, it is **possible** for transition `T5` to fire before transition `T3`.

### Shortest Firing Sequence:

- The shortest firing sequence that allows `T5` to fire before `T3` is:

  **T1 → T4 → T2b → T5**

### Conclusion:

It is indeed **possible** for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**. The shortest firing sequence that demonstrates this is **T1 → T4 → T2b → T5**.
