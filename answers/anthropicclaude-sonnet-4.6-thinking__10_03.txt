### Key

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **R** | Responsible – performs the work |
| **A** | Accountable – owns the outcome; single point of authority |
| **C** | Consulted – provides input before / during execution |
| **I** | Informed – notified of progress or outcome |
| **—** | No direct involvement at this activity |

### Notes
- **Intake Vetting** is owned and executed entirely by the Front-Office Analyst; all downstream roles are on standby (Informed) until the file is passed forward.
- **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, and **Risk Scoring** are sequential Compliance Analyst responsibilities; the Compliance Officer is Informed at the **Risk Scoring** step because the score determines whether escalation is triggered.
- **Compliance Officer Approval** activates only for cases where **Risk Scoring** exceeds 70; the Compliance Analyst is Consulted (supplies case detail) rather than Responsible at this stage.
- **Payment Scheduling** and **Fund Release & Notification** are consolidated under Treasury Ops; the Compliance Officer remains Informed to close the audit trail on approved escalations.
