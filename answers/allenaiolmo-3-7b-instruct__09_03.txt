I cannot compute the average cycle time for the “Approve Invoice” activity because the event-log stub (Artefact A) only provides the start and complete times for individual events, but not the sequence of events over time or the temporal relationship between an “Approve Invoice” event and its subsequent “Pay Invoice” event. Without knowing which “Approve Invoice” rows are followed by a payment and the duration between them, the required calculation cannot be performed from the information provided.
