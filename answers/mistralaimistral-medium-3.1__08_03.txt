Let's analyze the Petri net to determine if transition **T5** can fire before transition **T3** in any reachable marking.

### Key Observations:
1. **T5** requires tokens in both **pd** and **pe** to fire.
2. **pe** is produced by **T4**, which requires a token in **pb** (produced by **T1** alongside **pa**).
3. **pd** can be produced by either:
   - **T2b** (directly from **pa**), or
   - **T3** (from **pc**, which is produced by **T2** from **pa**).

### Can **T5** fire before **T3**?
For **T5** to fire before **T3**, **pd** must be populated without **T3** having fired. The only way to do this is via **T2b** (since **T3** itself requires **pc**, which would mean **T2** has already fired, and **T3** would typically follow).

### Shortest Firing Sequence:
Here is a sequence where **T5** fires before **T3**:
1. **T1** (consumes **p0**, produces **pa** and **pb**)
2. **T2b** (consumes **pa**, produces **pd**)
3. **T4** (consumes **pb**, produces **pe**)
4. **T5** (consumes **pd** and **pe**, produces **pf**)

At this point, **T5** has fired, and **T3** has not fired yet (since **pc** was never produced).

### Verification:
- After **T1**: Marking = {pa=1, pb=1}
- After **T2b**: Marking = {pb=1, pd=1}
- After **T4**: Marking = {pd=1, pe=1}
- After **T5**: Marking = {pf=1}

No token ever reaches **pc**, so **T3** cannot fire in this sequence.

### Answer:
**Yes**, it is possible for **T5** to fire before **T3**. One shortest firing sequence is:
**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**.
