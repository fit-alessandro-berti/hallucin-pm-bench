Based on average throughput versus Target SLA and waiting times, the three worst-performing activities are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval averages 900 s against a 600 s SLA - exceeding by 300 s - with 600 s average waiting. Risk Review averages 600 s against a 300 s SLA - exceeding by 300 s - with 480 s waiting. Credit Assessment averages 300 s against a 240 s SLA - exceeding by 60 s - with 200 s waiting. Legal Approval and Risk Review have the two largest SLA overages (300 s) and the highest waiting times; Credit Assessment has the next-highest waiting time among breaching steps.

• Legal Approval: Introduce a priority lane to cut average waiting by at least 300 s (from 600 s), aligning average throughput with the 600 s SLA.
• Risk Review: Set a queue policy to reduce average waiting by at least 300 s (from 480 s) so throughput meets the 300 s SLA.
• Credit Assessment: Reduce average waiting by at least 60 s (from 200 s) to meet the 240 s SLA.
