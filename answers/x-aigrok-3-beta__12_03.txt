1. **No**

2. **Justification**: The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between. However, the event-log excerpt shows that this is not true for all cases. Specifically:
   - For **CaseID C001**, the sequence is "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T09:12:00) followed immediately by "Validate_Payment" (2025-01-03T09:15:00), which aligns with the FACT.
   - For **CaseID C002**, the sequence is "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T09:30:00) followed by "Pack_Items" (2025-01-03T09:50:00), and then "Validate_Payment" (2025-01-03T10:05:00). Here, "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," contradicting the FACT.
   - For **CaseID C003**, the sequence is "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T09:40:00) followed immediately by "Validate_Payment" (2025-01-03T09:44:00), which aligns with the FACT.
   - For **CaseID C004**, the sequence is "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T10:05:00) followed by "Check_Fraud" (2025-01-03T10:07:00), and then "Validate_Payment" (2025-01-03T10:20:00). Here, "Check_Fraud" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," contradicting the FACT.

   Since the event log shows that in **CaseID C002** and **CaseID C004**, other activities ("Pack_Items" and "Check_Fraud," respectively) occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," the FACT is not accurate with respect to the provided excerpt.
