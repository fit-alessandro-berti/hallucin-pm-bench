# Answer: **No** — the FACT is not accurate.

## Justification

Examining each case's activity sequence:

| CaseID | Sequence | Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order? |
|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **C001** | Receive_Order → **Validate_Payment** → Pack_Items | ✅ Yes |
| **C002** | Receive_Order → **Pack_Items** → Validate_Payment | ❌ **No** — *Pack_Items* intervenes |
| **C003** | Receive_Order → **Validate_Payment** → Ship_Order | ✅ Yes |
| **C004** | Receive_Order → **Check_Fraud** → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items | ❌ **No** — *Check_Fraud* intervenes |

### Two clear counter-examples:

1. **C002**: *Pack_Items* occurs between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*, so Validate_Payment is **not** immediately after Receive_Order.
2. **C004**: *Check_Fraud* occurs between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*, again breaking the claimed direct succession.

Since the word **"always"** requires every case to conform, these two violations are sufficient to disprove the FACT.
