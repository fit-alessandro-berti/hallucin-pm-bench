Based on the provided Petri-net and initial marking, here is the analysis:

Yes, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

This is achievable by taking the "shortcut" path through transition `T2b`, which bypasses place `pc` entirely, thus never enabling `T3` on this path.

### Shortest Firing Sequence

One shortest firing sequence allowing T5 to fire is `T1, T2b, T4`. After this sequence, T5 is enabled while T3 is not. The complete sequence showing T5 firing is:

**`T1, T2b, T4, T5`**

### Formal Explanation

Let's trace the state of the net (the marking) through this sequence:

1.  **Initial Marking (M₀):**
    *   `{ p0=1, pa=0, pb=0, pc=0, pd=0, pe=0, pf=0 }`
    *   Only `T1` is enabled.

2.  **Fire T1:**
    *   `T1` consumes the token from `p0` and produces one token in `pa` and one in `pb`.
    *   **New Marking (M₁):** `{ p0=0, pa=1, pb=1, pc=0, pd=0, pe=0, pf=0 }`
    *   Enabled transitions: `T2`, `T2b`, `T4`.

3.  **Fire T2b:**
    *   This transition takes the "shortcut" path. It consumes the token from `pa` and produces one in `pd`.
    *   **New Marking (M₂):** `{ p0=0, pa=0, pb=1, pc=0, pd=1, pe=0, pf=0 }`
    *   Enabled transitions: `T4`.

4.  **Fire T4:**
    *   `T4` consumes the token from `pb` and produces one in `pe`.
    *   **New Marking (M₃):** `{ p0=0, pa=0, pb=0, pc=0, pd=1, pe=1, pf=0 }`
    *   Enabled transitions: `T5`.

At this point, in marking **M₃**, transition **T5 is enabled** because both of its input places (`pd` and `pe`) have a token. Transition **T3 is not enabled** because its input place `pc` is, and has remained, empty.

Therefore, `T5` can fire before `T3` has had any opportunity to fire.
