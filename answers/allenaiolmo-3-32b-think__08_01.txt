Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. Here is a concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:

**Firing Sequence:**  
1. **T1** fires first (only enabled transition initially).  
   - Consumes 1 token from **p0**, produces 1 token each in **p1** and **p2**.  
   - New marking: `p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`.

2. **T2** fires next (enabled by the token in **p1**).  
   - Consumes 1 token from **p1**, produces 1 token in **p3**.  
   - New marking: `p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`.

3. **T5** fires (enabled because **p3** has 1 token and **p4** has 0 tokens due to the inhibitor arc).  
   - Consumes 1 token from **p3**, produces 1 token in **p6**.  
   - New marking: `p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1)`.

**Justification:**  
At the marking after firing **T2**, both **T3** (enabled by **p2**) and **T5** (enabled by **p3** and inhibited **p4**) are concurrently enabled. Since Petri nets allow non-deterministic choice among enabled transitions, **T5** can fire before **T3** in this sequence. This demonstrates that **T5** can precede **T3** in some execution path.
