No. In case C003 (lines 6-7) and case C005 (lines 11-12), "Validate_Payment" occurs without first following a "Receive_Order" event. Specifically, C003 shows "Validate_Payment" occurring at line 6 before "Receive_Order" at line 7, and case C005 shows "Validate_Payment" at line 11 but never even logs a "Receive_Order" before being cancelled at line 12. Thus, the claim that "Validate_Payment" always follows "Receive_Order" is incorrect.
