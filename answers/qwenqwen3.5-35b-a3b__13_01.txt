4. **Two sampling-related reasons:**
   1. **Limited temporal scope:** The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01), which does not account for weekly patterns, weekends, or monthly variations in order volume or fraud risk.
   2. **Insufficient sample size:** The dataset contains only 18 events across 4 cases with a single occurrence of the rare event; this sparsity creates high statistical variance, making extrapolation to a monthly frequency unreliable.
