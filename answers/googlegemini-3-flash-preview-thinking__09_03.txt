It is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity because Artefact A contains only column headers with all numerical and temporal data redacted. Furthermore, Artefact B provides a historical lead time between two different activities (from approval to payment) rather than the internal duration of the approval activity itself, and it lacks the individual data points or sample sizes necessary to derive statistical variance.
