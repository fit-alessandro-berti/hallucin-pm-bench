No.  
• Case 1001: sequence is … Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued – Authorize_Refund comes after, not before, Update_Inventory.  
• Case 1002: Update_Inventory never occurs, so Authorize_Refund cannot be immediately before it.  
• Case 1003: … Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund – again, Authorize_Refund is after Update_Inventory, with another activity in between.

Thus, within every shown case the stated “Authorize_Refund → Update_Inventory” pattern never appears, so the claim is false.
