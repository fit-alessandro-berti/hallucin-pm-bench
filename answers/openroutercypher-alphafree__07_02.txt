### Summary of Changes in BPMN XML for Acme Bank’s Loan_Process

**Added tasks**:
1. `Task_VerifyIdentity`: Added as the new initial task after the `StartEvent_1`.
2. `Task_RequestDocs`: Added to handle cases where additional documents are missing.
3. `Task_FinalReject`: Added as an explicit step for final rejections.

**Removed tasks**:
1. `Task_RejectLoan`: Removed from the process.

**Gateway-type changes**:
- Exclusive Gateway → Inclusive Gateway: Changed from an **exclusive** gateway (`exclusiveGateway` in BPMN v1) to an **inclusive** gateway (`inclusiveGateway` in BPMN v2) at `Gateway_Decision`. This indicates the process now accounts for multiple outgoing sequence flows possibly being activated simultaneously, allowing for multiple outcomes based on the conditions met.

**Note**: Additional document requests and eligibility review processes were integrated, introducing a more nuanced decision structure compared to v1.
