Yes – you do not need to fire T3 before T5. For example, from the initial marking M₀={p0} do

  σ = ⟨T1, T2, T5⟩

1. T1: p0→p1+p2  
   M₁={p1,p2}  
2. T2: p1→p3  
   M₂={p2,p3}  (note p4=0!)  
3. T5: p3 –|p4→p6  
   M₃={p2,p6}

At M₂ we have a token in p3 and p4 is still empty, so the inhibitor‐arc condition for T5 is satisfied. Thus T5 fires before T3.
