To enforce the SLA, introduce a **Timer Intermediate Catch Event (Start_Timer)** attached to **Task_Receive**. This event will trigger after 48 hours.

Add a new sequence flow from **Start_Timer** to a new **Call Activity (Task_RequestEscalation)**, representing the auto-escalation process (which is assumed to exist).

Modify the original flow from **Task_Receive** to **Task_Check** by adding a *boundary event interruption* to the timer.

This ensures that if "Triage Claim" is not reached within 48 hours of *receiving* the claim, the timer will fire and trigger the escalation, without inventing new tasks.
