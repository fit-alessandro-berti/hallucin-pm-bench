1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** in this fragment.

2. There are **18 total logged events** in the fragment.
   Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ **5.56%**.

3. The case identifier containing **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** is:
   **A1002**

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:
   - **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 18 events, which is insufficient to generalize to a monthly frequency.
   - **Potential temporal bias**: The log covers a single day (May 1, 2025), and fraud-check patterns may vary across days, weeks, or months. The observed rate might not reflect long-term trends.
