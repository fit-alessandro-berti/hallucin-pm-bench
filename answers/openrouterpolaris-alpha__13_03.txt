1) The activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs 1 time in this excerpt.

2) Reasons for misestimation based only on this snippet:
- Very small sample: only three cases (1001–1003) from a short time window.
- Sample bias: activities shown are early-morning March 1; other days/times may differ.
- Naming inconsistency: “Manual Fraud Check” vs “Automatic Fraud Check” vs “Fraud Check (Automatic)” may hide or fragment true counts.
- Incomplete traces: some cases appear duplicated or out-of-order (e.g., “Send Offer” twice, repeated “Approve Application”), suggesting logging or extraction issues.
- No volume/selection info: we don’t know if these cases are typical, filtered, or exceptional.
