Alright — let's reason this through carefully.

---

## Step 1 – Understand the flow

We have:

- **Initial marking:**  
  p0 = 1, others = 0.

- **Transitions:**

```
T1: p0 → pa, pb
T2: pa → pc
T2b: pa → pd  -- shortcut
T3: pc → pd
T4: pb → pe
T5: pd + pe → pf
T6: pf → pc   -- feedback loop
```

---

## Step 2 – Read the question
We want to know:  
Is it possible for **T5** to fire *before* **T3** ever fires?

That means:

- We reach a marking enabling **T5** and we execute it (consuming pd and pe)  
- **Prior to that**, **T3** has not fired in the entire run from M₀ to that T5.

---

## Step 3 – Check structural possibilities

From the transition definitions:

- **T5** requires:  
  - 1 token in **pd**
  - 1 token in **pe**

- Ways to get those:

  - **pd** can come from:
    1. **T2b**: pa → pd (direct)
    2. **T3**: pc → pd (normal path)

  - **pe** can only come from:
    - **T4**: pb → pe

So for T5’s **pd** input, we don’t strictly need T3 – we could use T2b.

---

## Step 4 – Possible way to reach T5 without T3

Let's try to construct:

- Start: p0=1
- Fire **T1**: p0 → pa & pb  
  Now: pa=1, pb=1.

- Fire **T4**: pb → pe  
  Now: pa=1, pe=1.

- Fire **T2b**: pa → pd (shortcut)  
  Now: pe=1, pd=1.

We have both **pd**=1 and **pe**=1 ⇒ **T5** is enabled without ever firing T3.

---

## Step 5 – Shortest sequence

From above:

1. **T1** (p0 → pa, pb)
2. **T4** (pb → pe)
3. **T2b** (pa → pd)
4. **T5** fires — and T3 has not fired at any point.

That’s 3 steps to enable T5, then firing T5 in step 4.

---

## Step 6 – Conclusion

**Yes**, it is possible.

---

### One *shortest* firing sequence from the initial marking to the first firing of **T5** (before any T3):

**T1 , T4 , T2b , T5**

---

**Marking trace:**

| Step | Fired | p0 | pa | pb | pc | pd | pe | pf |
|------|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| M₀   | —     | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| M₁   | T1    | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
| M₂   | T4    | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
| M₃   | T2b   | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
| M₄   | T5    | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  |

**Answer:** ✅  
Possible, shortest sequence: **T1 → T4 → T2b → T5**
