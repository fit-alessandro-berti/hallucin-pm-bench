1. **No**

2. **Justification:**
   - The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," with no other activities in between.
   - The event log shows the following sequences:
     - **CaseID C002:** Receive_Order -> Pack_Items -> Validate_Payment
     - **CaseID C004:** Receive_Order -> Check_Fraud -> Validate_Payment
   - These sequences demonstrate that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur **immediately** after "Receive_Order."
