Subject: Identifying and Addressing Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time

Our analysis of the last 12 months' process performance data has identified the three worst-performing activities by waiting time. These activities are:

1. **Request_Documents**: 
   - Average waiting time: 36.5 hours
   - 95th-percentile waiting time: 120.0 hours
   Recommendation: Implement an automated document request system to reduce manual intervention, potentially cutting waiting time by ≥ 20%.

2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: 
   - Average waiting time: 12.2 hours
   - 95th-percentile waiting time: 44.0 hours
   Recommendation: Introduce a parallel process for preparing closure letters while claims are being assessed, likely reducing waiting time by ≥ 20%.

3. **Assess_Liability**: 
   - Average waiting time: 7.8 hours
   - 95th-percentile waiting time: 16.4 hours
   Recommendation: Allocate additional assessors or implement an AI-assisted liability assessment tool to expedite this process, aiming to cut waiting time by ≥ 20%.

Implementing these data-driven actions will significantly enhance process efficiency and customer satisfaction.
