**Decision Points**

Based on the process description provided, there is a single explicit decision point:

*   **High-Value Threshold:** A check to determine if the refund amount is **greater than €1 000**.
    *   *If yes:* The process proceeds to **Senior_Auditor_Review**.
    *   *If no:* The process bypasses the senior auditor and proceeds directly to the payment phase (subject to pre-approval).
