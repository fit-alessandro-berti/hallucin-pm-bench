2️⃣ This excerpt contains only 3 cases (1001, 1002, 1003). In this tiny sample, "Manual Fraud Check" appears in 33% of the cases. Because the snippet covers less than two hours of a full month, it is statistically insignificant and prone to sampling bias. It may miss periods of high volume or specific risk triggers. Consequently, an analyst might incorrectly assume manual reviews are common (occurring 1/3 of the time), whereas they could be rare or dominant in the full dataset.
