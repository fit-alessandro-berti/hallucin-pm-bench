We are given XES event log fragment with 10 lines (not sorted by order, but they are out-of-order lines). And tasks: There are three questions.

Let's re-read events text with each event piece by piece:

<event case="C456" concept:name="Validate_Order" time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:20:00+02:00"/>
1. event with C456, activity Validate_Order, timestamp: 9:20

<event case="C123" concept:name="Pack_Items"      time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:15:00+02:00"/>
2. event: C123, activity Pack_Items, time=9:15

<event case="C789" concept:name="Cancel_Order"    time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:45:00+02:00"/>
3. event: C789, Cancle Order, time=9:45

<event case="C456" concept:name="Ship_Order"      time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:40:00+02:00"/>
4. event: C456, Ship_Order, time=9:40

<event case="C123" concept:name="Ship_Order"      time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:25:00+02:00"/>
5. event: C123, Ship_Order, time=9:25

<event case="C123" concept:name="Create_Order"    time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:00:00+02:00"/>
6. event: C123, Create_Order, time=9:00

<event case="C456" concept:name="Pack_Items"      time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:35:00+02:00"/>
7. event: C456, Pack_Items, time=9:35

<event case="C789" concept:name="Create_Order"    time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:30:00+02:00"/>
8. event: C789, Create_Order, time=9:30

<event case="C456" concept:name="Create_Order"    time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:10:00+02:00"/>
9. event: C456, Create_Order, time=9:10

<event case="C123" concept:name="Validate_Order"  time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:05:00+02:00"/>
10. event: C123, Validate_Order, time=9:05

Okay. Let's re-read: lines are "out-of-order", but answer questions:

Let's check each question:

Question 1: "How many distinct cases (unique values of the 'case' attribute) are present?"

We have distinct case appearances: C456, C123, C789. Count: 3 distinct cases present.

Question 2: "For case 'C456', which activity immediately precedes 'Ship_Order'?"

For C456, referencing events with case = C456 events: There are events (timestamp): 
- For C456 events sorted by timestamp:
-- "Create_Order" (09:10:00)
-- "Validate_Order" (09:20:00)
-- "Pack_Items" (09:35:00)
-- "Ship_Order" (09:40:00)

So "Ship_Order" event aspect is the last one event at 09:40. So what event is immediately before? It is Pack_Items at 09:35. So correct answer is "Pack_Items" for C456 in the fragment. Alternatively check ordering: Because they are given different approach "immediately precedes" means in the case and ordered by timestamp ascending, the preceding event for Ship_Order event is Pack_Items. 
Thus answer: "Pack_Items" for case "C456".

But wait, the note "immediately precedes" means within the same trace corresponding to case C456 the activity that is earlier than "Ship_Order". Let me check carefully:
Case "C456" events: 
event with "Create_Order" at 09:10,
"Validate_Order" at 09:20,
"Pack_Items" at 09:35,
"Ship_Order" at 09:40. So the immediate predecessor is "Pack_Items". 
Yes that's answer.

Q3: "Which activity appears exactly once in the entire fragment?"

Now let's count occurrences of each activity:
Valid identifiable activities: 
- Create_Order appears in events: which events? 
From C123, Create_Order at 09:00. And C789, Create_Order at 09:30, and C456, Create_Order at 09:10. So Create_Order appears 3 times.

- Validate_Order appears in:
- event with C456, Validate_Order (09:20)
- event with C123, Validate_Order (09:05). That gives two.

- Pack_Items appears in:
- event with C123, Pack_Items (09:15),
- event with C456, Pack_Items (09:35). Two occurrences.

- Ship_Order appears in:
- event with C456, Ship_Order (09:40).
- event with C123, Ship_Order (09:25). Actually that's two occurrences.

Check Cancel_Order appears:
- event with C789, Cancel_Order (09:45) appears one time, I believe. Let's check out-of-order lines: yes, that appears exactly once? Check my events:
line 3: <event case="C789" concept:name="Cancel_Order" time:timestamp="2025-05-10T09:45:00+02:00"/>. And no other mentions of Cancel_Order. So Cancel_Order 1 occurrence. So answer: "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once.

Wait check if any other activity appears exactly once? 
Yes, only Cancel_Order is the one that appears exactly once.

Mark: events with Cancel_Order in C789 appears exactly once. So answer: "Cancel_Order" is answer. Because it's "immediately preceding" event, though given 'value' exactly? "Cancel_Order".

Better check others:
- Create_Order: appears three times, 
- Validate_Order: 2 times 
- Pack_Items: 2 times
- Ship_Order: 2 times
- CANCEL_ORDER: 9:45 in C789 appears one time.

Yes result is "Cancel_Order".

Thus answer for Q3 is "Cancel_Order".

So answers: bullet points:
- answer1: There are 3 distinct cases: C456, C123, and C789.
- answer2: For C456, immediately preceding "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items".
- answer3: "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once.

I'll check ordering details. In question Q2, if I check the case C456 events ordering by timestamp (I should check). 
In the fragment, events for C456:

Event ordered manually: 
C456 Create_Order from 09:10:00 
C456 Validate_Order from 09:20:00 
C456 Pack_Items from 09:35:00
C456 Ship_Order from 09:40.

So the event immediately preceding Ship_Order at 09:40 is indeed "Pack_Items" at 09:35. So answer confirmed.

Answer bullet points.

I'll output them bullet points.

I'll produce my answer (list bullet points using dash and each bullet point answer looks like):

- 3 distinct cases are present: C456, C123, C789.
- For case C456, the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items".
- The activity that appears exactly once is "Cancel_Order".

I'll output with bullet points formatting. Since requested "Give concise, bullet-point answers only." That is satisfied.

I'll output: "- Answer: ..." and bullet.

I'll just produce answer with bullet points. We'll produce bullet points: "Q1: ...", "Q2: ...", "Q3: ..." etc.

I'll produce my answer in plain text bullet points. Output:

Answers:

- Three distinct cases (C456, C123, C789)
- For case C456: the activity before "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items"
-(cancel order)

I'll produce my answer in bullet list.

I'll produce answer. We'll produce bullet bullet points with answers.

I'll produce answer accordingly. We'll produce answer in plain text bullet points.

I'll produce answer.• There are 3 distinct cases: C456, C123, and C789.
• For case C456, the event immediately before "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items" (at 09:35).
• The activity that appears exactly once is "Cancel_Order".
