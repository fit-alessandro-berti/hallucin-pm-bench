### **Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   - If the difference between the two risk scores is **≤ 2 points**, proceed to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.  
   - If the difference is **> 2 points**, escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for resolution.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   - If loan **amount < €15 000**, the system **auto-approves**.  
   - If loan **amount ≥ €15 000**, proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.
