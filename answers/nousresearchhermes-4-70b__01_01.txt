In Contoso’s described process, there is one explicit decision point:
• At Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility, the triage agent decides if the claim is eligible by verifying it against the FlightManifest and the WeatherReport. (Note: Although Finance_Controller also follows a checklist, the process does not explicitly label this a “decision” point.)

Here are all the documents involved:
• RefundRequestForm, 
• FlightManifest, 
• WeatherReport, 
• EligibilityChecklist, 
• AuditTrail (required only for high-value cases), 
• BankTransferAuthorization, and 
• RefundConfirmationPDF. 

No other activities or artefacts are included.
