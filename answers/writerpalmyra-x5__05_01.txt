Add an intermediate timer event after `Task_Check` that triggers if the claim hasn't reached `Task_Triage` within 48 hours. Specifically, attach a **non-interrupting timer event** to the boundary of `Task_RequestDocs` (or `GW_Docs`) with a duration of *P1D* (24 hours) to allow early detection, or insert a timer event on flow `f6` leading to an escalation path. However, since no new tasks are allowed, the most effective option is to set a **timer condition on flow `f4`**: if the delay from `Task_Check` to `Task_RequestDocs` exceeds 48 hours, redirect via a new sequence flow to an escalation end event or flag. But given constraints, best option: **attach a non-interrupting timer to `Task_RequestDocs`** with duration *P2D*, and route to a notification (using existing `Task_Notify`) when triggered. This ensures visibility without new tasks.
