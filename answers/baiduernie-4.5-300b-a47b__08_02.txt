**Question 1.** No. 

**Question 2.** T5 requires P2 and P5 to be marked. To mark P5, T4 must fire (requiring P4). To mark P4, either T7 (via T1→T2→T7) or T3 (via T1→T3) must fire. If T5 fires before T3, P4 (and hence P5) can only be marked via T7->T4, but this leaves P2 unconsumed—yet T3 (which also requires P2) must still fire later, forcing P2 to remain present. However, T5's firing consumes P2 (preventing T3) unless T3 fires first. This creates a conflict: P2 cannot satisfy both T3 (requires P2 unconsumed before firing) and T5 (consumes P2) in a valid sequence. Thus, no such sequence exists.
