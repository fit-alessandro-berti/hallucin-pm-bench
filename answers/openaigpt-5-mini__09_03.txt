I cannot compute the average cycle time, its standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval because the supplied event-log stub contains only the column headers and every row/timestamp value has been redacted. Computing those metrics requires the per-event timestamps (e.g., start_time and/or complete_time) for each "Approve Invoice" occurrence to derive individual durations, and the resulting sample mean, sample standard deviation, and sample size to construct a 95% CI; none of that data is present in the artefacts provided.
