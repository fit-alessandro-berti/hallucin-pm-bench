Yes.

A shortest firing sequence in which **T5 fires before any occurrence of T3** is:

**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

Marking evolution:

- **M0:** p0=1
- fire **T1** → **M1:** pa=1, pb=1
- fire **T2b** (shortcut) → **M2:** pd=1, pb=1
- fire **T4** → **M3:** pd=1, pe=1
- now **T5** is enabled (needs pd and pe); fire **T5** → **M4:** pf=1

No **T3** firing is needed, because **pd** is obtained via **T2b**.

Minimality: To enable **T5** you must have both **pd** and **pe**. Before the first **T5**, **pe** can only come from **T4** and **pd** (without firing **T3**) can only come from **T2b**; both **T2b** and **T4** require the tokens created by **T1**. Hence at least **T1 + (T2b and T4) + T5 = 4** firings are necessary, so the above sequence is shortest.
