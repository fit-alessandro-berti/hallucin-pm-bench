No. The log shows instances where *Validate_Payment* does not follow *Receive_Order*. For example, in **C002**, *Receive_Order* (line 3) is followed by *Check_Inventory* (line 4) before *Validate_Payment* (line 5). In **C003**, *Validate_Payment* (line 6) occurs before *Receive_Order* (line 7). Additionally, **C005** has *Validate_Payment* (line 11) without a preceding *Receive_Order*. These violations confirm the claim is false.
