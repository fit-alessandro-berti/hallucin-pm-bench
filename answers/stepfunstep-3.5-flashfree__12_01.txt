The fact is **inaccurate** based on the provided event-log fragment.

Justification:
- **Case 1001**: `Update_Inventory` occurs *before* `Authorize_Refund` (and there is an intervening activity).
- **Case 1002**: `Update_Inventory` does not appear at all.
- **Case 1003**: `Update_Inventory` occurs *before* `Authorize_Refund` (with `Quality_Check` in between).

In no case does `Authorize_Refund` immediately precede `Update_Inventory`.
