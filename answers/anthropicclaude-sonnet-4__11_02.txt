# Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance

**To:** COO  
**From:** Process Performance Analyst  
**Re:** Critical Performance Issues in Claims Process

## Three Worst-Performing Activities

**1. Request_Documents**
- **Issues:** Severe bottleneck with 150-min average wait time and catastrophic 22% rework rate
- **Action:** Implement automated document request system with standardized checklists to reduce rework and processing delays

**2. Review_Documents** 
- **Issues:** Highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and significant processing variability (9-min standard deviation)
- **Action:** Deploy AI-assisted document review tools with standardized quality checkpoints to reduce processing time variance and improve SLA compliance

**3. Initial_Assessment**
- **Issues:** Longest wait time after Request_Documents (18 minutes) creating upstream delays
- **Action:** Add dedicated assessment specialists during peak hours and implement priority routing for simple claims

## Impact
These three activities create a cascading effect, reducing overall throughput from 280 to 179 cases per day. Request_Documents' 22% rework rate particularly undermines downstream efficiency.

**Immediate Priority:** Address Request_Documents bottleneckâ€”fixing this single activity could restore 40+ cases/day capacity while reducing customer frustration from extended wait times.
