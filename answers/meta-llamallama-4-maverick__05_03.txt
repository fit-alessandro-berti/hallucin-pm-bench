To enforce the SLA, I suggest adding a boundary timer event to the "Verify Identity" user task, which triggers a escalation flow to ensure "Create Account in Core System" is executed within 48 hours.

Added XML elements:
```xml
<bpmn:boundaryEvent id="Event_Timer" name="SLA Timer" attachedToRef="Activity_VerifyID">
  <bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
    <bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>
  </bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
</bpmn:boundaryEvent>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_09" sourceRef="Event_Timer" targetRef="Activity_CreateAccount"/>
```
Justification: This change ensures that if "Create Account in Core System" is not executed within 48 hours of finishing "Verify Identity", the timer event triggers and directly proceeds to "Create Account in Core System", enforcing the SLA without adding new activities.
