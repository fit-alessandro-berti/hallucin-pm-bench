1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt (Case **1002**, 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).

2️⃣ From this snippet alone, frequency estimates can be misleading because it is a **very small, non-random excerpt** (only **3 cases** and a short time window on **2025-03-01**). The excerpt also shows **naming variation** for similar steps (e.g., **“Automatic Fraud Check”** vs **“Fraud Check (Automatic)”**), suggesting other variants could exist for manual checks too—so counting only the exact string may undercount. Additionally, the cases shown may not represent typical routing (e.g., some go through manual review, others do not), so the observed rate may not generalize.
