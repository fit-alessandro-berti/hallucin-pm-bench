No

The fact is not accurate because there is at least one case in the log where Validate_Payment does not follow Receive_Order (meaning it is not preceded by Receive_Order in that trace). In case C003, the first recorded activity is Validate_Payment (line 6), followed by Receive_Order (line 7), i.e., Validate_Payment directly precedes Receive_Order. Additionally, case C005 starts with Validate_Payment (line 11) and has no Receive_Order at all before it (or afterward, as the trace ends with Cancel_Order on line 12). While Validate_Payment does follow Receive_Order in cases C001 (lines 1→2), C002 (lines 3→5, with Check_Inventory in between), and C004 (lines 8→9), the presence of counterexamples in C003 and C005 violates the claimed "always follows" relationship.
