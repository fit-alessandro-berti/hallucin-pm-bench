**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance – Critical Concerns  

Three activities require immediate attention due to severe performance degradation:

1. **Request_Documents**: Exceptionally high wait time (150 min) and rework (22%) indicate a bottleneck and repeated requests.  
   *Action:* Analyze rework causes (e.g., unclear requests) to reduce repeat cycles and queue buildup.

2. **Review_Documents**: High SLA breaches (12.4%) and processing variability (25±9 min) suggest inconsistent execution.  
   *Action:* Standardize review checklists and provide targeted training to reduce time and variability.

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Elevated wait (18 min) and 3.2% SLA breaches signal capacity or prioritization issues.  
   *Action:* Adjust resource allocation or implement queue management to cut delays.

Addressing these will improve flow and compliance.
