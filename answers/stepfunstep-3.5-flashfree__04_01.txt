Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 is violated: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (index 4), so `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at index 8, and `Risk_Assessment` occurs at index 9, which is after `Ship_Goods`.

2. Rule 3 is violated: After `Goods_Received` (index 6), `Three_way_match` (index 10) must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The distance is 4 (activities at indices 7, 8, 9 between them), exceeding the limit.

3. Rule 1 is satisfied: For PO amount > €10,000, approvals by Procurement Officer (index 2) and CFO (index 3) both occur before `Issue_PO` (index 5).

4. Rule 4 is satisfied: No activity by Intern (`Move_to_Quality` at index 7) directly follows an activity by CFO (`Approve_PO_CFO` at index 3); the next activity after CFO is by System.

5. Rule 5 is satisfied: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (index 11) with no subsequent activities.
