**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Chief Operating Officer, Acme Insurance
**FROM:** Senior Process Performance Analyst
**DATE:** April 21, 2025
**SUBJECT:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Process Performance

This memo summarizes key performance issues within the Claims Handling process for Q1-2025, based on the provided dashboard.

The three worst-performing activities are:

1.  **Request\_Documents:** This activity exhibits a significantly high `rework_rate_pct` of 22.0%, indicating that a substantial portion of claims require additional documentation requests.
    *   **Recommended Action:** Implement clearer guidelines and standardized templates for initial document requests to minimize the need for follow-up.

2.  **Review\_Documents:** This activity has the highest `sla_breach_pct` at 12.4% and a high `rework_rate_pct` of 5.3%, suggesting processing delays and potential inefficiencies in document review. The high `stdev_processing_time_min` of 9 minutes also indicates variability.
    *   **Recommended Action:** Investigate bottlenecks in the document review process and explore opportunities for automation or specialized reviewer training to reduce variability and SLA breaches.

3.  **Initial\_Assessment:** While not as severe as the above, this activity shows the second-highest `rework_rate_pct` (1.8%) and the third-highest `sla_breach_pct` (3.2%), indicating it may be prone to errors or require re-work early in the process.
    *   **Recommended Action:** Enhance initial assessment protocols and provide additional training to ensure accuracy and reduce the need for rework and SLA breaches.
