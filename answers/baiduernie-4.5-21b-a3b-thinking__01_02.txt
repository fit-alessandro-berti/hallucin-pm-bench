### Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process  
1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate (Step 5)**: Decision based on whether the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤ 2 points (continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check if ≤2; escalate to Harmonisation Committee if >2).  
2. **Amount Threshold Decision (Step 7)**: Decision based on loan amount (< €15,000 vs ≥ €15,000) (auto-approve if <15k; proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval if ≥15k).  
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (Step 8)**: Decision based on the board’s vote (approve or reject).
