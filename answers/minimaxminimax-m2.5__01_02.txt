**Decision points (exact activity names as defined in the process)**  

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – confirms the applicant’s ID card and mobile phone; if verification fails the application stops.  
2. **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)** – the Impact Officer evaluates the community‑impact statement; a negative assessment halts the process.  
3. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – the scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B are compared.  
   * If the difference is **≤ 2 points**, processing continues.  
   * If the difference is **> 2 points**, the application is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie‑break before moving forward.  
4. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** – at least three local references must be collected; missing the required references blocks further steps.  
5. **Amount Threshold Decision** –  
   * **Amount < €15 000** → auto‑approve (system proceeds).  
   * **Amount ≥ €15 000** → move to the next gate.  
6. **Final Micro‑loan Board Approval (MBA)** – the board votes *approve* or *reject*. Only an *approve* vote allows the process to continue.  
7. **Disburse Funds** – the final execution step; occurs only after a successful MBA vote.
