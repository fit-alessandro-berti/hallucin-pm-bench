The fact is inaccurate because, in case C003, the Validate_Payment activity (line 6, timestamp 10:43:00Z) precedes the Receive_Order activity (line 7, timestamp 10:45:00Z), directly contradicting the claim that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order. In other cases, such as C001 (lines 1-2), C002 (lines 3 and 5), C004 (lines 8-9), and C005 (line 11), Validate_Payment does follow Receive_Order, but the presence of this single counterexample in C003 violates the "always" condition for the entire log.
