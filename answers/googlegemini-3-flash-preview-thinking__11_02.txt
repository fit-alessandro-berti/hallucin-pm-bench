**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** April 2025  
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Bottlenecks

Analysis of Q1 performance data identifies three critical activities requiring immediate intervention:

1.  **Request_Documents:** This is the primary system bottleneck. It exhibits an extreme **150-minute average wait time** and a **22% rework rate**, causing a significant throughput drop from 270 to 190 cases/day.  
    *   **Action:** Implement an automated "smart checklist" for customers to ensure document completeness upon first submission, targeting a reduction in rework.

2.  **Review_Documents:** This activity records the highest **SLA breach rate (12.4%)** and high processing variability (**9m StDev**), indicating inconsistent execution despite a 25-minute average processing time.  
    *   **Action:** Standardize the review workflow via decision-support software to minimize variability and stabilize processing times within SLA limits.

3.  **Initial_Assessment:** This stage shows the third-highest **SLA breach rate (3.2%)** and an **18-minute wait time**, signaling a capacity mismatch at the start of the chain.  
    *   **Action:** Reallocate staffing resources from the high-throughput/low-wait *Register_Claim* stage to *Initial_Assessment* to clear the early-stage queue.

Addressing these specific inefficiencies will significantly improve total cycle time and customer experience.
