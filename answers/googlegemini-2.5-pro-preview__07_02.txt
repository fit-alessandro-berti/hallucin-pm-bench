Here is a summary of all changes between BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2 of Acme Bank’s *Loan_Process*, grouped under the specified headings:

• **Added tasks**
    *   `Task_VerifyIdentity` (name: "Verify Identity")
    *   `Task_RequestDocs` (name: "Request Additional Documents")
    *   `Task_FinalReject` (name: "Final Reject")

• **Removed tasks**

• **Gateway-type changes**
    *   The gateway `Gateway_Decision` changed from an `exclusiveGateway` in BPMN_v1 to an `inclusiveGateway` in BPMN_v2. (The name change for this gateway from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check" is a cosmetic renaming and is ignored as per instructions.)
