Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2 violated:** `Expedite_Flag` occurs (#4), so `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` is at #8, but `Risk_Assessment` is at #9 (after shipping).

2. **Rule 3 violated:** After `Goods_Received` (#6), `Three_way_match` must be completed **within the next two activities** (distance ≤ 2). The next two activities are #7 `Move_to_Quality` and #8 `Ship_Goods`, but `Three_way_match` occurs at #10, which is too late.
