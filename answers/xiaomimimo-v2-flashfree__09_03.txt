I cannot compute the requested metrics.

The provided event-log stub contains no data. While the column names are present, all rows containing the actual `case_id`, `activity`, `start_time`, and `complete_time` values required to calculate cycle times have been redacted. Without these specific timestamps for the "Approve Invoice" activity, it is impossible to derive the average duration, standard deviation, or confidence interval.
