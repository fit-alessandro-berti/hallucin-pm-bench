Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Key under-performers

- **Request_Documents**: Bottleneck with the longest queue (150 min wait) and a sharp throughput drop (270→190/day). A 22% rework rate drives repeat work and 5.5% SLA breaches. **Action:** Standardize and clarify document requests, coupled with a pre-submission checklist, to cut rework; adjust staffing to shrink the 150-minute queue.

- **Review_Documents**: Slow and variable (25 min avg processing, stdev 9), adding a 30-minute wait; 5.3% rework and the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%). **Action:** Implement a standardized review checklist and calibration sessions to reduce variability and rework, and re-balance workload to bring breaches down.

- **Initial_Assessment**: Among remaining steps, it shows elevated wait (18 min) and processing time (12 min) with 3.2% SLA breaches and 1.8% rework. **Action:** Increase assessor capacity or triage simpler claims to reduce the queue, and tighten assessment criteria to lower rework and SLA breaches.
