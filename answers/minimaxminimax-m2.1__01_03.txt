# Acme Bank Small-Business Loan Process Analysis

## a) Decision Points Summary

**Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3)**
- Risk assessment outputs a rating of Low, Medium, or High based on the three color-coded scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow).

**Conditional Branch (Step 4)**
- If the Tri-Color-Risk-Check yields Low or Medium risk **AND** the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, the process skips Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise, it proceeds to Step 5.

**TriVote Decision Gate (Step 6)**
- The application requires votes from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer; any two affirmative votes constitute approval and advance the process to Step 7.
