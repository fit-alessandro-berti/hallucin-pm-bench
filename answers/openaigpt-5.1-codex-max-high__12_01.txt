No. In case 1001, `Update_Inventory` happens before `Authorize_Refund`, so `Authorize_Refund` is not immediately before it. In case 1003, `Update_Inventory` again precedes `Authorize_Refund` (with `Quality_Check` in between). Case 1002 has no `Update_Inventory` at all. The claimed ordering never occurs in these cases.
