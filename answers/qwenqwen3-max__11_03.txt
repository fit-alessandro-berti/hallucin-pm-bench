Subject: Top 3 Process Bottlenecks Requiring Immediate Action  

Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment exhibit the largest combined SLA breaches and waiting times. Risk Review exceeds its 300s SLA by 300s (600s total), Legal Approval by 300s (900s total), and Credit Assessment by 60s (300s total). All three show waiting times constituting most of their throughput: 480s, 600s, and 200s respectively.  

• Reallocate underutilized staff from Customer Acceptance or Fund Disbursement to reduce Risk Review queue backlog.  
• Implement parallel legal-review workflows to cut Legal Approval’s 600s wait time.  
• Automate data-pull steps in Credit Assessment to target its 200s wait time, bringing total time under 240s SLA.
