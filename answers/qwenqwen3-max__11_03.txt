Subject: Urgent Process Bottlenecks Requiring Intervention  

Analysis of throughput and SLA performance reveals three critical bottlenecks: Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds (900s actual) with 600s waiting time; Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds (600s actual) with 480s waiting time; Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds (300s actual) with 200s waiting time. These activities exhibit both the largest SLA breaches and the highest waiting times relative to targets.  

- Redeploy staffing or automate document routing in Legal Approval to reduce the 600-second waiting time, which constitutes two-thirds of total cycle time.  
- Streamline Risk Review by aligning input readiness from upstream steps to address the 480-second wait, which accounts for 80% of its cycle time.  
- Introduce parallel processing or decision rules in Credit Assessment to cut the 200-second waiting time, currently two-thirds of its duration.
