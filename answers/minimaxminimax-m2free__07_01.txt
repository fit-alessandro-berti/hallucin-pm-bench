I need to compare these two BPMN XML snippets carefully and identify only the factual differences. Let me analyze each section:

From v1 to v2:
- New task "check_vip" is added
- The gateway gw_valid changes from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway
- New task "generate_qr" is added
- Some sequenceFlow IDs and connections change due to these additions

Let me be very systematic:

Added tasks:
- check_vip (new task between receive_request and validate_warranty)
- generate_qr (new task between approve_return and end)

Removed tasks:
- None (all tasks from v1 are still in v2)

Gateway type changes:
- gw_valid changes from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway

I need to be careful about sequenceFlows but the user specifically asked for only task and gateway changes, not sequence flow changes.

### Added tasks  
• check_vip  
• generate_qr  

### Removed tasks  
• (none)  

### Gateway type changes  
• gw_valid (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway)
