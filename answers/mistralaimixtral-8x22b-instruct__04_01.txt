**Non-compliant**

Justification:
1. **Rule 1**: The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, requiring two approvals (Procurement Officer and CFO) before `Issue_PO`. This is satisfied (events 2 and 3 occur before event 5).
2. **Rule 2**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event 4), making `Quality_Check` optional (not present, which is acceptable) and requiring `Risk_Assessment` before the first `Ship_Goods`. However, `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` (event 8), violating this rule.
3. **Rule 3**: After `Goods_Received` (event 6), `Three_way_match` (event 10) occurs within the next two activities (events 7 and 8), satisfying the distance ≤ 2 requirement.
4. **Rule 4**: No activity by `Intern` (event 7) directly follows an activity by `CFO` (event 3), so this rule is satisfied.
5. **Rule 5**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event 11), satisfying this rule.

The primary violation is **Rule 2** due to the incorrect ordering of `Risk_Assessment` and `Ship_Goods`.
