To enforce the 48-hour SLA without new tasks, attach a **Non-Interrupting Boundary Timer Event** (ID: `Timer_SLA_Breach`) to `Task_Receive` (ID: `Task_Receive`).

Set its timer definition attribute to `PT48H` (48 hours). Create a new sequence flow from `Timer_SLA_Breach` to a **Message End Event** (ID: `End_Escalate`) named "SLA Breached - Auto-Escalate". This design signals escalation if `Task_Triage` is not reached within 48 hours of claim submission (timer starts when `Task_Receive` activates), allowing the main process flow to continue unaffected.
