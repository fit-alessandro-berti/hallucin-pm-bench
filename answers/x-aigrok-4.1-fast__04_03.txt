**No**

- **Rule 1 violated**: QE and RA do not occur in that order (QE before RA); RA occurs after NA.
- **Rule 3 violated**: NA occurs before RA is complete.
- **Rule 2 (for High severity)**: VP is after both QE and RA, so satisfied if prior rules held, but irrelevant due to violations.
- **Rule 4**: CC is after NA (and VP), so satisfied if prior rules held, but irrelevant due to violations.
