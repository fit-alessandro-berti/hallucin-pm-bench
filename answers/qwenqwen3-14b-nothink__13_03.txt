1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because this snippet only includes a small portion of the full month-long log. It shows only three cases, and only one of them includes a "Manual Fraud Check." This limited sample may not represent the overall process, as the true frequency could be higher or lower depending on the full dataset. Additionally, the inclusion of different activities (e.g., "Fraud Check (Automatic)") may obscure patterns or suggest a lower prevalence of manual checks than actually exists.
