The justification is insufficient to confirm the fact. There is data for cases 1001, 1002, and 1003, but no information about whether "Authorize_Refund" occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" in any of them. The log does not show the sequence required to prove the claim, so the fact cannot be determined as accurate based solely on this fragment.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
No conclusive evidence is provided in the event-log fragment to determine whether "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case.

However, since the instruction asks for a short justification, I will provide one:

Because the log lacks the necessary sequence data for any of the cases, the fact cannot be confirmed as accurate.
