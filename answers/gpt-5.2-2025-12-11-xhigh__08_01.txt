Yes.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking is:

**⟨T1, T2, T5, T3⟩** (so **T5 fires before T3**).

Markings:

- **M0:** p0=1  
  fire **T1** → **M1:** p1=1, p2=1
- fire **T2** → **M2:** p3=1, p2=1 (and **p4=0** since T3 hasn’t fired)
- In **M2**, **T5 is enabled** because it needs **p3=1** and its inhibitor arc requires **p4=0**.  
  fire **T5** → **M3:** p6=1, p2=1
- Now **T3** can still fire afterward (from p2).

So it is reachable to fire **T5** while **T3 has not yet occurred**, by taking the p1-branch first and using that p4 is still empty.
