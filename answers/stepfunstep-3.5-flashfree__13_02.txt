3. Manual_Fraud_Check appears only once across 48 events and in one of 12 cases. Generalizing from this low-support activity risks treating it as typical, distorting performance metrics (e.g., cycle times) due to its outlier nature. Predictive models may overfit or incorrectly weight this rare event, reducing accuracy on the broader process where it is absent. Such overestimation can lead to misguided decisions about process redesign or resource allocation.
