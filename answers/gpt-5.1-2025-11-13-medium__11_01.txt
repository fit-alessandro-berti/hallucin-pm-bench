Subject: Longest waiting-time bottlenecks in claims process  

Analysis of last 12 months identifies three worst-performing activities by waiting-time:

#1 Request_Documents – average 36.5h; 95th percentile 120.0h. Action: Introduce automated, multi-channel reminders and escalation for cases pending >24h; targeting the 95th-percentile tail should cut average waits by at least 20%.

#2 Send_Closure_Letter – average 12.2h; 95th percentile 44.0h. Action: Trigger letter generation immediately upon case closure via workflow automation instead of batch handling, with alerts if not sent within 4h.

#3 Assess_Liability – average 7.8h; 95th percentile 16.4h. Action: Implement a “next-in-queue within 8h” rule, with real-time dashboard and manager reallocation of work for items breaching this threshold; designed to reduce waiting-time by ≥20%.
