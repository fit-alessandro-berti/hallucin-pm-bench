Attach an **interrupting Timer Boundary Event** to `Task_RequestDocs`. Configure the timer expression to trigger if elapsed time since `Start_Claim` exceeds 48 hours. Upon timeout, redirect the flow from the event directly to `Task_Triage`. This forces the claim to reach the triage milestone within the SLA window, bypassing prolonged document requests. This effectively auto-escalates the process state without adding new tasks. The modification utilizes allowed event elements to enforce the time constraint on the critical path before `Task_Triage`.
