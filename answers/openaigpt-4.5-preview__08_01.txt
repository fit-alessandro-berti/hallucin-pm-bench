### Step-by-step Analysis:

**Step 1 (Initial Marking)**:  
Initially, the Petri net has one token at place `p0`, and all other places are empty:
```
Marking M0: p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
```

**Step 2 (First Firing)**:  
Initially, **only transition T1** is enabled since it requires tokens from `p0` only. No other transitions initially have the required tokens.
- M0 [T1⟩ M1  
After firing T1:
```
Marking M1: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
```

**Step 3 (Transitions Available after T1)**:
- `T2` can fire (requires p1)
- `T3` can fire (requires p2)
- `T5` cannot fire yet because it requires a token in `p3` (currently empty) and inhibitor arc from `p4` (clearly satisfied now, since p4=0), but the token in `p3` is still missing.

**Step 4 (Can we fire T5 before T3?)**:  
Transition T5 has an inhibitor arc from place `p4`. It is enabled only if:
- Place `p3` **does contain** a token.
- Place `p4` **does not contain** any token.
  
Currently (in Marking M1), `p3` is empty, so T5 is certainly **not enabled yet**. We must place a token into `p3` first.

**Step 5 (Creating Enablement for T5)**:  
We fire T2 (using token from `p1`) to produce a token in place `p3`:
- M1 [T2⟩ M2  
```
Marking M2: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
```

**Now at marking M2:**  
- `T5` requires token in `p3` (SATISFIED), and no token in `p4` (SATISFIED).
- At M2, `T5` is fully **enabled**:
  - All normal conditions fulfilled: p3(1)
  - Inhibitor condition also satisfied: p4 = 0.

At this marking (`p2=1`, `p3=1`, `p4=0`), transition T3 is still possible (enabled), but we are NOT forced to fire T3 at this instant.

**Crucially**, **we can fire** T5 **now**, **before ever firing T3**:
- M2 [T5⟩ M3  
```
Marking M3: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1)
```

Thus, we have successfully reached a marking in which T5 has indeed fired **before T3**.

## Concrete Firing Sequence:

| Step | Transition fired | Resulting marking                      |
|------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 0    | (initial marking)| p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0) |
| 1    | T1               | p1(1), p2(1)                           |
| 2    | T2               | p3(1), p2(1)                           |
| 3    | T5               | p6(1), p2(1)                           |

In this sequence (`T1 → T2 → T5`), transition T5 fires without ever firing transition T3.

## Final Answer:  
**Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire **before transition T3**.

**Concrete Example Sequence:** `T1 → T2 → T5`

**Brief Justification:**  
After firing `T1` and `T2`, we have tokens in `p3` and `p2` but no token in `p4`. This scenario enables the inhibitor transition `T5`. At this point, T3 has never been fired yet (since `p2` still contains its original token from `T1`). Therefore, **T5 can indeed fire before T3**.
