1. The activity "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" occurs **1** time in the excerpt.

2.  a) Percentage of all events including "Manual\_Fraud\_Check": (1 / 48) * 100 = **2.08%**
    b) Percentage of all unique cases including "Manual\_Fraud\_Check": (1 / 12) * 100 = **8.33%**

3.  The activity is present in only one case out of twelve. Generalizing from this limited data could lead to misleading conclusions. For example, creating a predictive model to identify cases needing manual checks based on only this data could result in poor predictions, because the observed characteristics may not be representative of the broader population of claims. A low-support activity in a small slice of the log shouldn't be treated as a widespread pattern.
