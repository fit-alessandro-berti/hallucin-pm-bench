**MEMORANDUM**  
**TO:** COO, Orion Credit  
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**SUBJECT:** Critical Process Bottlenecks and Remedial Actions  

Our analysis identifies three critical activities underperforming against SLA targets with excessive waiting times.  

**Risk Review** exhibits the most severe SLA breach, with an average throughput of 600 seconds against a 300-second target, exceeding it by 300 seconds (100%). Waiting time constitutes 80% of total throughput. **Credit Assessment** follows, with throughput at 300 seconds versus a 240-second SLA, exceeding by 60 seconds (25%). Waiting time here is 200 seconds. **Legal Approval** has a throughput of 900 seconds against a 600-second SLA, exceeding by 300 seconds (50%), with waiting time accounting for 600 seconds.  

To address these inefficiencies:  
- **Risk Review:** Implement parallel processing for cases to reduce the 480-second average waiting time.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Reallocate resources to decrease the 200-second waiting time, which drives the SLA overage.  
- **Legal Approval:** Introduce a pre-validation checklist to cut the 600-second waiting time, aligning throughput with the SLA.
