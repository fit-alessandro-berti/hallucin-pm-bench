Alright — let’s go step-by-step.

## **Q1 — How many distinct cases are present?**  
We see the attribute `case="..."` in each line. Let’s extract them:

- C001  
- C002  
- C003  

That’s **3** distinct cases.

✅ **Answer:** **3**

---

## **Q2 — Sequence of activities for case "C002"**

Look only at lines having `case="C002"`, keeping chronological order from timestamps:

- **Line 2** → `Receive_Order` — 2025-03-01T09:15:10  
- **Line 5** → `Check_Stock` — 2025-03-01T09:22:55  
- **Line 8** → `Arrange_Delivery` — 2025-03-01T10:15:20  
- **Line 10** → `Ship_Order` — 2025-03-01T10:25:40  

So:

✅ **Answer:** **Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

---

## **Q3 — Distinct activities that immediately precede “Ship_Order”**

We want *across all cases*, the event that occurred just before each `Ship_Order` in the same case:

### Case C001:
- Sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
- Preceding `Ship_Order`: **Check_Stock**

### Case C002:
- Sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
- Preceding `Ship_Order`: **Arrange_Delivery**

### Case C003:
- Sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
- Preceding `Ship_Order`: **Check_Stock**

List distinct preceding activities: **{Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock}**  

Alphabetically sorted:

1. Arrange_Delivery  
2. Check_Stock  

---

**Final Answers:**  

1. **3**  
2. **Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**  
3.  
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```

Do you also want me to produce this as a **visual process graph** from the given 10 events? That could make the flow even clearer.
