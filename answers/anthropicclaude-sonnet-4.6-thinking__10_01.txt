## Rationale notes

- **KYC Review** — the CO holds sole R/A; the AM is **Consulted** as the document submission owner.  
- **Order Vetting** — the AM is R/A for data-completeness checks; the CO is **Consulted** to confirm any compliance flags raised in the prior step.  
- **Payment Clearance** — the FC is R/A for initiating settlement; all other roles are **Informed** once funds are cleared.  
- **Record Update** — IT holds R/A; the FC is **Consulted** to confirm settlement data before the CRM is refreshed.
