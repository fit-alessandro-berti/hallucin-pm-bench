1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ This snippet includes only **3 cases (1001–1003)** and spans roughly **09:02–10:45 UTC on 2025-03-01**, so the observed frequency (1 occurrence) may not reflect the full month’s distribution. Additionally, even within this small sample the same type of step is logged with different labels (e.g., **“Automatic Fraud Check”** vs **“Fraud Check (Automatic)”**). If manual fraud checks are also logged under multiple names, counting only the exact string **“Manual Fraud Check”** could undercount in the full log (or be confused with nearby manual steps like **“Manual Review”**).
