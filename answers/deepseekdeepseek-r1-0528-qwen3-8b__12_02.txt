No

The fact is not accurate because, in case C003, there is a `Validate_Payment` event (line 6) that is not preceded by a `Receive_Order` within the same case. The `Receive_Order` for C003 appears later at line 7. Similarly, in case C005, a `Validate_Payment` (line 11) occurs without a preceding `Receive_Order` in the same case, as verified by the fragment. Therefore, `Validate_Payment` does not always follow `Receive_Order`.
