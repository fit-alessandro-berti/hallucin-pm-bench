1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in the excerpt.

2️⃣ This snippet contains only **3 cases (1001–1003)** and a small number of events, so it may not be representative of the full month. With such a limited sample, the observed frequency of **“Manual Fraud Check”** (1 occurrence) could differ substantially from the month-long distribution. Also, the excerpt shows **inconsistent activity naming for fraud checks** (e.g., **“Automatic Fraud Check”** vs **“Fraud Check (Automatic)”**), which suggests that counting only one exact label could miss other relevant events if the full log contains additional naming variants.
