Insert a timed intermediate catch event after *Task_Check* named "Check Deadline" with a 48-hour duration. Connect it to *GW_Docs* via a new sequence flow (id="f3a") that triggers if the timer fires. Modify the existing flow *f3* (from *Task_Check* to *GW_Docs*) to only activate if no time has elapsed. If the timer fires, route directly to a new escalation path: *f3a* â†’ *Task_Triage* (bypassing any missing docs check). This ensures all claims reach *Task_Triage* within 48 hours, fulfilling the SLA without adding tasks.
