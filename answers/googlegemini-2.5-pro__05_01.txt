To meet the 48-hour SLA, the process must not wait indefinitely for missing documents.

The best improvement is to attach an **interrupting Timer Boundary Event** to the `Task_RequestDocs` task.

Set this timer for a 48-hour duration (e.g., `PT48H`). If the timer fires before documents are received, it will interrupt `Task_RequestDocs`. The sequence flow from this new timer event must then connect directly to `Task_Triage`, reusing the logic of flow `f6`.

This change ensures that claims are automatically escalated to triage if documents are not supplied within the SLA window, preventing the process from getting stuck and guaranteeing compliance without adding any new tasks.
