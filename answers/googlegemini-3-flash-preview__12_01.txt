No. The statement is **inaccurate** based on the provided event-log fragment.

**Justification:**
In all cases where both activities appear, the sequence is the opposite of the claim, or the activities do not appear together at all:

*   **Case 1001:** "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55, which is **before** "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02).
*   **Case 1003:** "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, while "Authorize_Refund" occurs later at 10:22:18.
*   **Case 1002:** "Update_Inventory" does not occur in this case, making the "always occurs" claim impossible to verify for this instance.

In no instance in the data does "Authorize_Refund" occur before "Update_Inventory."
