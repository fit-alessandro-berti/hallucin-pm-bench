Subject: Q1‑2025 Claims Handling Performance Hotspots

The three worst-performing activities are:

1) **Request_Documents** – Throughput drops to 190/day, and cases wait an average 150 minutes before a 5‑minute task. Rework is 22.0%, driving queues and 5.5% SLA breaches. *Action:* Redesign intake to capture document requirements upfront and add staff during peak hours to cut waiting; set a first‑time‑right target to reduce rework.

2) **Review_Documents** – Long processing (25 minutes) with high variability (stdev 9), coupled with 30‑minute queues, yields the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and 5.3% rework. *Action:* Standardize review checklists and implement triage by complexity to reduce processing time variability; supplement capacity until breach rate falls below target.

3) **Initial_Assessment** – Although throughput is 270/day, cases queue 18 minutes and take 12 minutes to complete, leading to 3.2% SLA breaches and 1.8% rework. *Action:* Introduce clearer assessment guidelines and quick decision aids to shorten processing time and rework; consider reallocating experienced staff to this step to trim queues.
