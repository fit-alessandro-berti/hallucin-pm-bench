Looking at the event log fragment, I'll analyze the cases and activities chronologically.

**Answers:**

• **3 distinct cases**: C123, C456, and C789

• **For case C456, "Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order"**
  - Timeline for C456: Create_Order (09:10) → Validate_Order (09:20) → Pack_Items (09:35) → Ship_Order (09:40)

• **"Cancel_Order" appears exactly once** in the entire fragment
  - Activity frequencies: Create_Order (3), Validate_Order (2), Pack_Items (2), Ship_Order (2), Cancel_Order (1)
