 1. To compute the average cycle time (in hours) of activity "Approve Invoice", we first need the complete_time - start_time values for each row where the activity is "Approve Invoice". However, these values are redacted in the event log. Without these values, it's impossible to calculate the average cycle time.

2. Since we cannot calculate the average cycle time, we also cannot compute the standard deviation or a 95 % confidence interval from the given information.

3. The reason we cannot compute any metric is because the essential data needed to perform the calculations (complete_time - start_time values) is redacted in the event log. Without this data, we cannot proceed with the analysis.
