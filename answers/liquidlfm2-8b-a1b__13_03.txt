1. The activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs exactly **once** in the excerpt.  

2. An analyst reviewing only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because the full month-long log likely contains many more applications processed through manual review, but this short excerpt shows only one such event. With no context on process volume or timing, the analyst cannot infer that manual checks are rare, potentially underestimating their true prevalence and the analyst’s likelihood of encountering them in broader operations.
