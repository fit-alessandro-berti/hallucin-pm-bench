1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1 time** in this fragment.

2. There are a total of 18 logged events in the fragment. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” makes up \( \frac{1}{18} \approx 5.56\% \) of all logged events (rounded to two decimal places).

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate might be unreliable are:
   - **Limited data scope**: The dataset contains events from only four cases over a single day. This limited scope might not be representative of typical operations, especially any variability in activities over different times or other external factors.
   - **Lack of context**: Without understanding the criteria or thresholds for triggering a “Manual_Fraud_Check”, it's unclear whether this activity occurs due to specific conditions or randomly. The low sample quantity does not offer a reliable basis to infer the frequency or determine patterns accurately.
