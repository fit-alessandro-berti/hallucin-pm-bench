1. **No**

2. **Justification:**

The statement claims that **“Validate_Payment” always occurs immediately after “Receive_Order,” with no other activities in between.**  
Let’s check each CaseID in the log:

---

- **C001**
  - Receive_Order → 09:12
  - Validate_Payment → 09:15  
  *(Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order. No activities in between—this case matches)*

---

- **C002**
  - Receive_Order → 09:30
  - Pack_Items → 09:50
  - Validate_Payment → 10:05  
  *(“Pack_Items” occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment.” The fact is violated.)*

---

- **C003**
  - Receive_Order → 09:40
  - Validate_Payment → 09:44  
  *(Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order. No activities in between—this case matches)*

---

- **C004**
  - Receive_Order → 10:05
  - Check_Fraud → 10:07
  - Validate_Payment → 10:20  
  *(“Check_Fraud” occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment.” The fact is violated.)*

---

**Summary:**  
- For **C002** and **C004**, there is an activity (“Pack_Items” and “Check_Fraud,” respectively) occurring between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment.”
- Therefore, the statement is **not always true**.

---

**Relevant CaseIDs and sequences contradicting the fact:**
- **C002:** `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`
- **C004:** `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment`

---

**Conclusion:**  
The fact is **not accurate** with respect to the event-log excerpt.
