As a senior process-mining analyst, I will answer your questions based solely on the provided XES log excerpt.

**1. How many times does the activity “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” occur in the excerpt?**

The activity "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" occurs **1** time (in case C05).

**2. What percentage of**
**a) all *events* and**
**b) all *unique cases* (12 in total) include that activity? Round to two decimals.**

*   **Total Number of Events:** 48
*   **Number of Events with "Manual\_Fraud\_Check":** 1
*   **Number of Unique Cases:** 12
*   **Number of Cases with "Manual\_Fraud\_Check":** 1 (Case C05)

a) Percentage of all **events**:
$$\frac{1}{48} \times 100 \approx 2.0833\%$$
Rounded to two decimals: **2.08%**

b) Percentage of all **unique cases**:
$$\frac{1}{12} \times 100 \approx 8.3333\%$$
Rounded to two decimals: **8.33%**

**3. In ≤100 words, explain why such a low-support activity can mislead performance or predictive analyses if we generalise from this slice.**

A low-support activity like "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" (occurring only once out of 12 cases) represents an **outlier or an exception**. Generalizing from this single instance can severely mislead analysis. A predictive model might incorrectly associate the 'Manual\_Fraud\_Check' activity with a dominant outcome (like 'Approve\_Payout' in this log) or drastically skew average processing times, as this single event's duration will heavily influence the mean calculation for any path it belongs to. It suggests a path variant that is not representative of the overall process behavior.
