1. The average cycle time of the activity "Approve Invoice" cannot be computed from the supplied log because all timestamp values (including start_time and complete_time for each event) have been redacted, leaving no data to calculate durations.

2. The standard deviation and 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity duration also cannot be computed due to the absence of actual timestamp or duration data in Artefact A. While Artefact B provides a historical average (7.8 days) for the interval from *Approve Invoice* to *Pay Invoice*, this is not equivalent to the cycle time of "Approve Invoice" itself, nor does it include variance information required for standard deviation or confidence intervals.

3. Precise reason: The event log contains no usable timestamp values—every row's temporal data has been redacted—so individual activity durations (such as "Approve Invoice") are unavailable for computation of mean, standard deviation, or confidence intervals based solely on the provided artefacts. No statistical inference can be made without observed data points from the log in question.
