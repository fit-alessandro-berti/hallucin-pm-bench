Based on the provided log data, we can identify the activities "Review Contract" and "Negotiate Terms" across the cases.

For "Review Contract":
- Case C-001: drafter_3  
- Case C-002: drafter_1  
- Case C-003: drafter_4  

For "Negotiate Terms":
- Case C-002: drafter_3  
- Case C-004: legal_2  

Now, let's analyze the timestamps (partial values are shown due to format):  
- Case C-001: date = 2023-06-01 to 0.8h  
- Case C-002: date = 2023-06-01 to 7.2h  
- Case C-003: date = 2023-06-01 to 1.1h  
- Case C-004: date = 2023-06-01 to 0.0h per record only.

Assuming reasonable estimation between the given durations and normalizing to equivalent time periods:

From C-001, C-002, and C-003, the average duration falls around **1–2 hours**.  
Combining this with the historical benchmark of **7.2 h for "Negotiate Terms"**, which is slightly complex, we currently cannot confidently estimate "Review Contract".

Considering available data, we **cannot derive** the exact average cycle time for "Review Contract" with full support. 

**Conclusion:** The requested value cannot be derived from the provided information.
