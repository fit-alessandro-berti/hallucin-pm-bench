**No**

The trace 2025-05-RX17 is not compliant with ruleset R. Here is the reasoning based on each relevant rule:

1. **Rule 1:** Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur once each and in that order.  
   - **Violation:** In the trace, `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occurs after `Notify_Authorities` (NA), which violates the rule that requires RA to occur after QE.

2. **Rule 2:** If the case-level attribute `severity = "High"`, activity `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen after both QE and RA.  
   - **Compliance:** `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` in the trace, so this rule is satisfied.

3. **Rule 3:** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until after QE and RA are complete.  
   - **Violation:** `Notify_Authorities` occurs immediately after `Quality_Engineer_Review` and before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, violating the rule that requires it to occur only after both QE and RA are complete.

4. **Rule 4:** `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only after NA (and, if required by rule 2, after VP).  
   - **Compliance:** `Close_Case` occurs after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`, so this rule is satisfied.

The violations of Rules 1 and 3 result in the trace being non-compliant with the ruleset R.
