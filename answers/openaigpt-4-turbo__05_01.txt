To ensure every claim reaches "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage) within 48 hours, introduce an intermediate timer event after the start event ("Start_Claim") that triggers if 48 hours pass without reaching the "Triage Claim" task. Connect this timer event via a new sequence flow to "Task_Triage", ensuring automatic escalation. Modify the existing sequence flow from "Start_Claim" to "Task_Receive" (f1) to include a condition that only follows this path if 48 hours have not elapsed, ensuring that claims are either processed normally or escalated based on the SLA time constraint.

Example update to the BPMN XML elements for clarity:
1. Add `<bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent id="Timer_Escalation" name="48 Hour Timer">` followed by `<bpmn:timerEventDefinition/>` and `</bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent>`
2. Connect this event with `<bpmn:sequenceFlow sourceRef="Timer_Escalation" targetRef="Task_Triage"/>` ensuring direct escalation.
