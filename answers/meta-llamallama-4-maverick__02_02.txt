To answer the given questions, we will analyze the provided XES event log fragment.

### Q1: Number of Distinct Cases

To find the number of distinct cases, we need to identify unique case identifiers from the given log.

1. Case identifiers are given in the "case" attribute of each event.
2. From the log:
   - Line 1: C001
   - Line 2: C002
   - Line 3: C001
   - Line 4: C003
   - Line 5: C002
   - Line 6: C003
   - Line 7: C001
   - Line 8: C002
   - Line 9: C003
   - Line 10: C002

The distinct cases are C001, C002, and C003.

**Answer to Q1:** There are 3 distinct cases.

### Q2: Sequence of Activities for Case "C002"

To find the sequence of activities for case "C002", we will identify all events related to "C002" and order them by their timestamp.

1. Events for C002:
   - Line 2: Receive_Order at 2025-03-01T09:15:10
   - Line 5: Check_Stock at 2025-03-01T09:22:55
   - Line 8: Arrange_Delivery at 2025-03-01T10:15:20
   - Line 10: Ship_Order at 2025-03-01T10:25:40

2. Ordered sequence:
   - Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

**Answer to Q2:** The sequence of activities for "C002" is Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order.

### Q3: Distinct Activities that Immediately Precede "Ship_Order"

To identify the activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order", we will examine the events for each case and determine the activity that comes right before "Ship_Order".

1. For C001:
   - Sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order (from lines 1, 3, and 7)
   - Activity before Ship_Order: Check_Stock

2. For C002:
   - Sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order (from lines 2, 5, 8, and 10)
   - Activity before Ship_Order: Arrange_Delivery

3. For C003:
   - Sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order (from lines 4, 6, and 9)
   - Activity before Ship_Order: Check_Stock

The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are Check_Stock and Arrange_Delivery.

**Answer to Q3 (in alphabetical order):**
1. Arrange_Delivery
2. Check_Stock
