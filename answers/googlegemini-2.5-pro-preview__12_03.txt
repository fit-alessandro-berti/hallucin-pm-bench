1. **No**

2. **Justification:**
The FACT is not accurate.
*   In **CaseID C002**, the activity "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T09:30:00) is immediately followed by "Pack_Items" (2025-01-03T09:50:00), not "Validate_Payment". "Validate_Payment" occurs later in this case (2025-01-03T10:05:00).
*   In **CaseID C004**, the activity "Receive_Order" (2025-01-03T10:05:00) is immediately followed by "Check_Fraud" (2025-01-03T10:07:00), not "Validate_Payment". "Validate_Payment" occurs after "Check_Fraud" in this case (2025-01-03T10:20:00).

These cases demonstrate that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order."
