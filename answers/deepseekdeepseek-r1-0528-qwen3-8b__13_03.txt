1️⃣ Based on the provided event-log excerpt, the exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **once** (associated with CaseID 1002, Timestamp 2025-03-01T07:13Z).

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because this snippet is extremely limited, featuring only three distinct case IDs (1001, 1002, 1003) with partial logs that include duplicates (e.g., multiple entries for CaseID 1001). The small sample size could suggest manual fraud checks are common (if these cases with manual processes are overrepresented) or rare (if these cases aren't typical). Additionally, the presence of multiple automatic fraud checks (three occurrences) might lead to overestimating the frequency of all fraud checks, thereby misjudging the rarity of manual ones in a full month-long log where unlogged cases could alter the prevalence dramatically.
