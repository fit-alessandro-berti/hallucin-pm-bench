It is not possible to compute the average cycle time of the activity “Approve Invoice” from the information provided. The event-log stub only includes the column headers, with all rows and timestamp values redacted. Since cycle time calculations require actual start_time and complete_time values for the specific activity instances, and this data is unavailable, the required metrics (average, standard deviation, and confidence interval) cannot be derived.
