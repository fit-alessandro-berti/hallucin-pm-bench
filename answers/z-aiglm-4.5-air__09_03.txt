I cannot compute the average cycle time for "Approve Invoice" because the event-log stub contains no data rowsâ€”only the header is provided. Without actual timestamp values (start_time and complete_time) for the activity, no numerical metrics can be calculated. The absence of data makes it impossible to derive cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence intervals.
