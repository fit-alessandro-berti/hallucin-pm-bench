Here they are, ranked by severity:

1.  **Request_Documents:** Waiting averages **36.5 hours**, with the 95th percentile at a staggering 120.0 hours.  
    *   **Action:** Automate the initial document request to trigger immediately after a claim passes screening.

2.  **Send_Closure_Letter:** Waiting averages **12.2 hours** (95p: 44.0h).  
    *   **Action:** Automate letter dispatch to occur instantly upon claim approval or rejection.

3.  **Assess_Liability:** Waiting averages **7.8 hours** (95p: 16.4h).
