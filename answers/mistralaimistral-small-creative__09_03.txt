Given the artefacts provided, **none of the requested metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for "Approve Invoice") can be computed exactly**. Here’s why:

The event log stub (Artefact A) contains only column headers with no actual data—no timestamps, case IDs, or activity durations are visible. Without the raw timestamps for "Approve Invoice" events (specifically `start_time` and `complete_time` for each occurrence of this activity), it is impossible to calculate cycle times, their variability, or confidence intervals. The corporate SLA catalogue (Artefact B) provides historical averages but does not include the underlying data needed for statistical analysis. Since the log is fully redacted, no approximations or derivations are possible.
