1. **No.**

2. The claim is false because there are cases where other activities occur between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, or where **Validate_Payment** does not follow **Receive_Order** at all:

- **Case C001**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  Here Validate_Payment *does* directly follow Receive_Order (this case supports the statement).

- **Case C002**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  Here **Pack_Items** occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, so Validate_Payment does **not** occur immediately after Receive_Order.

- **Case C003**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order`  
  Here Validate_Payment directly follows Receive_Order (supports the statement).

- **Case C004**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  Here **Check_Fraud** occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, so Validate_Payment does **not** occur immediately after Receive_Order.

Since C002 and C004 contradict the claim, the statement is **not** accurate for the event-log excerpt.
