Add one interrupting timer boundary event to “Task_RequestDocs” (id=Task_RequestDocs). Configure it with a 48-hour timeDuration (e.g., “PT48H”) starting from the claim’s submission (id=Start_Claim). If this timer triggers before “Task_RequestDocs” completes, the boundary event interrupts that task and follows a new sequence flow directly to “Task_Triage” (id=Task_Triage). This ensures that, even if missing documents are not received in time, the claim still enters triage within 48 hours, meeting the SLA.
