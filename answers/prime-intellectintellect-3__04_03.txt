**Answer: No**

### Justification:
The trace violates **Rule 3** of the recall-handling ruleset. Below is a step-by-step reference to each rule:

- **Rule 1**: Satisfied.  
  Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occur exactly once, and in the required order (QE before RA). In the trace, QE is the third event, and RA is the fifth event.

- **Rule 2**: Satisfied.  
  Since the case severity is "High", `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must occur after both QE and RA. In the trace, VP is the sixth event, which is after QE (third event) and RA (fifth event).

- **Rule 3**: Violated.  
  `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until after both QE and RA are complete. In the trace, NA is the fourth event, but RA (the fifth event) has not yet occurred at that point. Therefore, NA happens before RA is complete, violating the rule.

- **Rule 4**: Satisfied.  
  `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after `Notify_Authorities` (NA) and, due to the high severity, after `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP). In the trace, CC is the seventh event, after NA (fourth event) and VP (sixth event).

The trace is non-compliant primarily due to the violation of Rule 3, as NA prematurely occurs before RA is complete.
