**No**. The trace 2025-05-RX17 is not compliant with ruleset R for the following reasons:

1. **Rule 1 Violation**: The trace does not include `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) after `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE). Rule 1 mandates that both `QE` and `RA` must occur **once each and in that order**. The trace lacks RA, thus violating this requirement.

2. **Rule 2 Violation**: Although the case severity is "High", the trace does not include `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) after both `QE` and `RA`. Rule 2 specifies that for high severity cases, `VP_Safety_Approval` must happen **after both QE and RA**. The absence of VP in the trace violates this rule.

3. **Rule 3 Compliance**: The trace correctly places `Notify_Authorities` (NA) after `QE` and `RA`, satisfying Rule 3 which requires `NA` to occur **only after** both `QE` and `RA` are complete.

4. **Rule 4 Compliance**: The trace includes `Close_Case` (CC) after `NA`, which is compliant with Rule 4. Rule 4 states that `CC` may occur **only after** `NA` (and, if required by rule 2, after `VP`). Since `VP` is not required in this case, the trace complies with this rule.

In summary, the absence of `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` and `VP_Safety_Approval` in the correct order violates Rules 1 and 2, making the trace non-compliant.
