1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” appears exactly 1 time in the fragment.  
2. There are 18 events in total, so 1/18 × 100 = 5.56%.  
3. Case A1002 contains “Manual_Fraud_Check.”  
4. Two sampling‐related reasons why a monthly estimate based solely on this fragment is unreliable:  
   a. Very limited time window and sample size – the fragment covers just one day (18 events), so estimates will have high variance and may not reflect typical daily or monthly activity.  
   b. Selection/temporal bias – the data are from a single date and a small subset of cases; they may not be representative of normal operations over an entire month (e.g., seasonality, peak periods, or anomaly days are not captured).
