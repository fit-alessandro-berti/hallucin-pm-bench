**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**  
1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: Determines whether the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B are within 2 points (proceed) or require escalation to the Harmonisation Committee.  
2. **Amount Threshold Decision**: Routes applications for amounts ≥ €15,000 to the Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA), while auto-approving those below €15,000.  
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: The board votes to approve or reject applications meeting or exceeding the €15,000 threshold after prior steps clear.
