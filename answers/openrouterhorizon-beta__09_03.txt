I cannot compute the requested metrics because the event log contains no actual rows or timestamps—only the column headers are provided and all values are redacted. To calculate the average cycle time of “Approve Invoice,” its standard deviation, and a 95% confidence interval, I would need at least the start_time and complete_time (or lifecycle transitions) for each “Approve Invoice” event in the log. Without any event instances or timestamps, there is no data to aggregate or analyze, so the metrics cannot be derived.
