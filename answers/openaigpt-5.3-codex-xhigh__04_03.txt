**No.**

- **Rule 1 (QE then RA once each):** **Satisfied** — `Quality_Engineer_Review` appears once, `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` appears once, and QE is before RA.  
- **Rule 2 (High severity requires VP after QE+RA):** **Satisfied** — severity is High, and `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3 (NA only after QE+RA):** **Violated** — `Notify_Authorities` occurs **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.  
- **Rule 4 (CC only after NA and, if required, VP):** **Satisfied** — `Close_Case` occurs after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.

Because **Rule 3 is violated**, the trace is **not compliant**.
