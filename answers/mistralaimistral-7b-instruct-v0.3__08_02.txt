 **Question 1.** No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking of PN-8. This is because the enabling condition for T5 requires both tokens in places P2 and P5, while the enabling condition for T3 only requires a token in place P2. Since the firing of T3 removes the token from P2, T5 cannot fire before T3.

**Question 2 (bonus).** If we assume a firing sequence, let's consider the minimal one that demonstrates the possibility: [T1, T2, T7, T5, T3]. However, as explained in the answer to Question 1, this sequence is not possible due to the firing conditions of T5 and T3. Therefore, no such sequence exists in PN-8.
