I need to determine the average cycle time for the "Review Contract" activity, but I notice the log only shows activity and resource without durations or timestamps. The header mentions that timestamps and elapsed-time fields are redacted, which means I can't calculate actual durations. 

I'm wondering if I can still estimate average durations using the historical benchmark provided for FY-2023. However, those averages are from a different customer segment, so they might not be applicable here.

The question asks for the average cycle time of the "Review Contract" activity, but I notice there's no benchmark provided for it in the FY-2023 data. The historical benchmark only includes durations for "Receive Renewal Request," "Negotiate Terms," and "Legal Sign-off." Since I lack actual durations in the log and there's no benchmark for this specific activity, it seems I cannot derive this value directly from the data provided.

I need to respond that the requested average cycle time for the "Review Contract" activity cannot be derived because I lack the necessary data, including redacted elapsed times and any relevant benchmarks. This issue wasn't mentioned in the header, but I should clarify this limitation in my response.

Regarding the "calculation" part of the question, since I can’t calculate it, I’ll just say that it's not possible. I'll keep my answer concise as instructed.

The request is for the average cycle time of the "Review Contract" activity across all cases in the log. However, I can't compute this because the timestamps and elapsed times are redacted. Only counts are possible, but the user is asking for a specific average. 

I can identify three occurrences of the "Review Contract" activity in the cases, but without any durations, I cannot calculate a meaningful average. So, I’ll state that the requested value cannot be derived from the available data.

The user might want to see a formula, but without durations, I can't compute the average. I need to mention that I observed three cases of the "Review Contract" activity, but since there are no timestamps or elapsed times, I cannot derive the average. 

I will keep the response simple and directly state that "cannot be derived." The benchmark is from a different segment and doesn't apply, especially since it doesn't include "Review Contract." My final answer will just note that the information is not available.

Cannot be derived.

Reason: The log data provided does not include timestamps or elapsed time for the “Review Contract” activity, nor is there a benchmark for it. I can observe three “Review Contract” occurrences (cases C‑001, C‑002, C‑003), but without any duration information, the average cycle time cannot be computed.
