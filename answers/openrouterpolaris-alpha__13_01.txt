4. Two sampling-related reasons the estimate is unreliable:
- The fragment is extremely small (only 18 events / 4 cases), so any rate computed from it is highly sensitive to random variation and not statistically stable.
- The fragment covers only a very narrow time window (all events on a single day) and may not be representative of typical activity patterns over an entire month (e.g., different days, weeks, seasons, or volumes).
