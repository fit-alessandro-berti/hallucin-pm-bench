The log you provided contains only the activity names, case IDs and the resources that performed each activity. All timestamp and elapsed‑time fields have been redacted, so the actual duration of each “Review Contract” event is not available.

Because we lack the start‑ and end‑times (or elapsed‑time values) for the “Review Contract” activity, the average cycle time **cannot be derived** from the data shown.

*If the timestamps (or elapsed times) were present, the average cycle time would be computed as the sum of the durations of all “Review Contract” occurrences divided by the number of such occurrences (there are four instances of “Review Contract” in the provided log).*
