Let's analyze the Petri net step by step to determine whether **T5** can fire before **T3** in any reachable marking.

---

### **Key Observations:**
1. **T5's Inputs:** `pd` and `pe` must both be marked for **T5** to fire.
   - `pd` is produced by **T2b** (directly) or **T3** (via `pc`).
   - `pe` is produced by **T4** (from `pb`).

2. **T3's Input:** `pc` must be marked for **T3** to fire.
   - `pc` is produced by **T2** (from `pa`).

3. **Initial Marking:** Only `p0` is marked (`p0 = 1`), so the only initially enabled transition is **T1**.

### **Can T5 Fire Before T3?**
For **T5** to fire before **T3**, the following must hold:
- **T5** must be enabled (i.e., `pd` and `pe` are marked) **before** `pc` is marked (since **T3** requires `pc`).
- However, `pd` is either:
  - Produced directly by **T2b** (from `pa`), or
  - Produced by **T3** (from `pc`).

**Critical Insight:**
- If **T5** fires before **T3**, then `pd` must come from **T2b** (not **T3**), because **T3** hasn't fired yet.
- But **T2b** and **T2** both consume `pa` (they are in conflict). If **T2b** fires (producing `pd`), then **T2** cannot fire (since `pa` is consumed), and thus `pc` is never produced. This means **T3** cannot fire at all, which contradicts the requirement that **T5** fires *before* **T3**.

**Formal Explanation:**
- For **T5** to fire before **T3**, `pd` must be marked before `pc` is marked.
- The only way to mark `pd` before `pc` is by firing **T2b** (since **T3** hasn't fired yet).
- But firing **T2b** consumes `pa`, preventing **T2** from firing, which means `pc` is never marked. Thus, **T3** cannot fire at all.
- This is a **deadlock**: **T5** cannot fire (since `pe` is not marked yet), and **T3** cannot fire (since `pc` is not marked).

**Conclusion:** It is **impossible** for **T5** to fire before **T3** in any reachable marking.

### **Formal Proof (by Contradiction):**
Assume there exists a firing sequence where **T5** fires before **T3**. Then:
1. **T5** fires, meaning `pd` and `pe` are marked.
   - `pd` must come from **T2b** (since **T3** hasn't fired yet).
   - `pe` must come from **T4** (which requires `pb`).
2. For **T2b** to fire, `pa` must be marked (from **T1**).
   - Firing **T2b** consumes `pa`, so **T2** cannot fire (since `pa` is now empty).
   - Thus, `pc` is never marked, and **T3** cannot fire.
3. This contradicts the assumption that **T3** fires after **T5**.

Therefore, no such firing sequence exists.

---

### **Short Answer:**
**No**, it is impossible for **T5** to fire before **T3** in any reachable marking. The reason is that marking `pd` (required for **T5**) via **T2b** consumes `pa`, preventing **T2** from firing and thus leaving `pc` unmarked (so **T3** cannot fire). This creates a deadlock where neither **T5** nor **T3** can fire.
