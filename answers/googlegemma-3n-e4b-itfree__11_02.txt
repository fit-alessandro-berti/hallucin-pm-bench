**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** COO, Acme Insurance
**FROM:** [Your Name], Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review

This memo summarizes key performance insights from the Q1-2025 Claims Handling process dashboard.  Three activities warrant immediate attention based on performance metrics.

**Request Documents** exhibits the lowest throughput (190 cases/day) and highest rework rate (22.0%). The substantial wait time (150 mins) likely contributes to the rework, suggesting potential document retrieval bottlenecks. **Recommendation:** Investigate document source efficiency and explore options for automated document retrieval tools.

**Review Documents** demonstrates significant variability in processing time (stdev_processing_time_min = 9 mins), leading to high average processing time (25 mins). This variability likely reflects inconsistencies in document complexity and reviewer experience. **Recommendation:** Implement standardized review guidelines and potentially provide additional training to reviewers to reduce consistency gaps.

**Initial Assessment** has a high average wait time (18 mins) and a notably high SLA breach rate (3.2%). The higher-than-average variability in processing time (stdev_processing_time_min = 4 mins) may contribute to SLA breaches. **Recommendation:** Analyze reasons for long wait times.  Identify and address root causes to shorten Initial Assessment processing.
