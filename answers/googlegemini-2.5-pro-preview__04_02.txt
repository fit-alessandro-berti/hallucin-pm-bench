R1: Compliant. Amount > â‚¬10k; Manager_Approval (03-03) correctly followed by Finance_Approval (03-04).
R2: Violated. Expedited. Ship_Goods (03-05) occurred before its R5-required new Manager_Approval (03-07), not *after* it.
R3: Violated. Pay_Invoice (03-06) occurred before Receive_Goods (03-07), violating the sequence.
R4: Not Applicable. PO not marked hazardous, so safety inspection rule does not apply.
R5: Violated. Change_Request (03-04) after approvals; Ship_Goods (03-05), a further step, occurred before new Manager_Approval (03-07).
R6: Compliant. The case correctly terminates with Archive_Record (event 10).

Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT
