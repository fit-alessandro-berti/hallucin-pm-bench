**No.**

**Justification:**  
The event log contains multiple instances where “Validate_Payment” does **not** occur immediately after “Receive_Order”:

- **CaseID C002**: After “Receive_Order”, the next activity is “Pack_Items” at 09:50:00. “Validate_Payment” occurs later at 10:05:00, meaning another activity (“Pack_Items”) intervenes.
- **CaseID C004**: After “Receive_Order”, the next activity is “Check_Fraud” at 10:07:00, followed by “Validate_Payment” at 10:20:00. Thus, “Validate_Payment” is not immediate—“Check_Fraud” occurs in between.

These sequences contradict the claim that “Validate_Payment” **always** follows “Receive_Order” immediately.
