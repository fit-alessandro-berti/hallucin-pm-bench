Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2**: The presence of `Expedite_Flag` (event 4) requires that `Risk_Assessment` occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. However, in the trace `Ship_Goods` appears at event 8 while `Risk_Assessment` appears later at event 9, violating the required sequence.

2. **Rule 3**: After `Goods_Received` (event 6), the activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). `Three_way_match` occurs at event 10, with three intervening activities (events 7, 8, and 9) separating it from `Goods_Received`, which exceeds the allowed distance.
