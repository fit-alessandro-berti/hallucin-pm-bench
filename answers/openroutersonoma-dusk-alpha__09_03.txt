The provided event log stub contains only column headers and explicitly states that every row and every timestamp value has been removed for privacy reasons, leaving no actual data available for computation. Without any complete_time or start_time values associated with the "Approve Invoice" activity across cases, it is impossible to calculate cycle times (which require differences between timestamps), and thus the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval cannot be computed exactly. This limitation stems directly from the redacted nature of the artefact, with no supplementary data in the SLA catalogue or elsewhere to enable derivation of these metrics.
