- Very small, non-representative sample size (only 18 events and 4 cases from a single short time window), leading to high variance and potential selection bias.
- Temporal coverage bias: the fragment spans only part of one day; manual checks may vary by time of day/day of week/season, so extrapolating to a month is unreliable.
