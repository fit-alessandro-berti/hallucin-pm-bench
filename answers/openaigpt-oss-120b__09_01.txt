The log excerpt only lists the sequence of activities (case ID, activity name, and resource). The timestamps and elapsed‑time fields that would be needed to calculate how long each “Review Contract” step took are redacted, so the duration of that activity cannot be determined from the data provided.

**Therefore, the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the given log.**
