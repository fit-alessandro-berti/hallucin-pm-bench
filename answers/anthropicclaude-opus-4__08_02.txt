**Question 1:** Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Question 2:** One minimal firing sequence is: **T1, T2, T7, T4, T5**

**Explanation:** After T1 fires, tokens are placed in both P1 and P2. Following the path T2â†’T7, we can move the token from P1 through P3 to P4. Then T4 moves this token to P5. At this point, P2 still contains its token (from T1) and P5 has a token, satisfying T5's preconditions. Thus T5 can fire, consuming both tokens and producing one in P6. Throughout this sequence, T3 never fires - it remains enabled but unfired. This demonstrates that T5 can indeed fire before T3 in a valid execution of the Petri net.
