2️⃣ This snippet covers only 3 cases from early March 1st, with "Manual Fraud Check" appearing once (in Case 1002). Activity naming inconsistencies (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check" for Case 1001 vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)" for Case 1003) suggest potential variations for manual checks elsewhere. Without the full log, an analyst might underestimate frequency if this non-representative sample lacks broader patterns or additional cases. (72 words)
