**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** COO, Orion Credit  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Subject:** Worst-Performing Activities in Loan Application Process  

Analysis of provided process data identifies the three worst-performing activities based jointly on Target_SLA breaches (Avg_Throughput_Time exceeding Target_SLA) and high Avg_Waiting_Time: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.  

Legal Approval exceeds its 600s Target_SLA by 300s (900s throughput), with 600s waiting time across 465 cases.  
Risk Review exceeds its 300s Target_SLA by 300s (600s throughput), with 480s waiting time across 480 cases.  
Credit Assessment exceeds its 240s Target_SLA by 60s (300s throughput), with 200s waiting time across 1175 cases.  

**Recommendations:**  
- **Legal Approval:** Allocate additional reviewers to address 600s waiting time for 465 cases.  
- **Risk Review:** Prioritize staffing for 480 cases with 480s waiting time exceeding 300s Target_SLA.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Add assessors to reduce 200s waiting time across 1175 cases.
