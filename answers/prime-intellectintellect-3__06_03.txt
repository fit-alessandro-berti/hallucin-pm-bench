Based solely on Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment, the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently (i.e., tasks on different branches of the **same** parallel construct) are:

1. **Set 1** (from Parallel Split #1):  
   - `Quality_Check`  
   - `Update_Inventory`  

2. **Set 2** (from Parallel Split #2):  
   - `Generate_Replenishment_Report`  
   - `Notify_Procurement`  

These sets correspond to the two parallel splits in the process, listed in the order they appear.
