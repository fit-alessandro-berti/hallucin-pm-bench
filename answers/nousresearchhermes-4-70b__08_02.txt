**Question 1:** Yes, transition T5 can fire before T3.  

**Question 2:** One minimal firing sequence is T1 → T2 → T7 → T5. Here's why it works:  

1. **T1** fires (P0 → P1, P2).  
2. **T2** fires (P1 → P3).  
3. **T7** fires (P3 → P4).  
4. **T5** now fires (P2 and P4 are present), consuming both and producing P6.  

This sequence requires T3 to fire afterward, but T5 fires first.
