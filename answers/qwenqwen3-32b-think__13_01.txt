1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in the fragment.  
2. This represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1/18 * 100 = 5.555...).  
3. The case identifier containing “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.  
4. Two sampling-related reasons for unreliable estimation:  
   - The fragment covers only **one day** of data, which may not reflect typical monthly patterns (e.g., seasonal or temporal variations).  
   - The sample size is **small (4 cases)**, making it statistically insufficient to generalize monthly frequency. Rare events like “Manual_Fraud_Check” might be underrepresented or overrepresented in such a limited sample.
