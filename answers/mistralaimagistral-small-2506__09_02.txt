The average cycle time for the **“Dual Authorization”** activity cannot be determined with the provided information.

**Reason:** The event log header indicates that timestamps were not released in the sanitised data, and the frequency table only reports occurrences of start and complete transitions without recording their actual durations or timestamps. Without temporal data, cycle time cannot be calculated.

*(Note: If timestamps were available, you could compute the time delta between each "start" and "complete" event for the activity, then average them. Here, both are absent.)*
