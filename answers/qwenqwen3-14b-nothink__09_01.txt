1) The **average cycle time** of the activity **“Review Contract”** across all cases in the log **cannot be derived** from the provided data.

2) **Explanation**: The cycle time for an activity is typically calculated as the time elapsed between the start and end of that activity. However, the provided event log only includes the activity names, case IDs, and resources, but **does not include timestamps or elapsed times**. Without this information, it is not possible to determine the duration or average cycle time of the "Review Contract" activity.
