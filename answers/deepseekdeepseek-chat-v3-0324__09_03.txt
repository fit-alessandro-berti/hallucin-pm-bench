1. **Average cycle time of "Approve Invoice":** Cannot be computed.  
2. **Standard deviation and 95% confidence interval:** Cannot be computed.  

**Reason:** The event-log stub (Artefact A) contains no actual dataâ€”all rows and timestamps are redacted. Without the concrete `start_time` and `complete_time` values for the "Approve Invoice" activity, it is impossible to calculate cycle times or any derived statistics. Artefact B provides aggregate KPIs but no raw event-log data required for the computation.  

*(No assumptions or extrapolations are made due to lack of data.)*
