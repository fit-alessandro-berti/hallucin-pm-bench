2️⃣ This snippet covers only 3 cases (1001–1003) on 2025-03-01 (early hours), representing a tiny fraction of a month-long log (15 events total). With just 1 “Manual Fraud Check” in case 1002 amid 2 automatic variants, an analyst might overestimate (33% of cases) or underestimate commonality due to small sample size, non-random early-day selection, and incomplete traces (e.g., no archive for 1002). Frequency estimate has high variance. (78 words)
