Based on the specific process description for Acme Bank’s small-business loans, here are the requested summaries:

### **a) Decision Points (Gates & Branches)**

1.  **Risk/Amount Threshold (Step 4):** The process skips manual underwriting if the risk rating from the Tri-Color-Risk-Check is either Low or Medium AND the requested loan amount does not exceed €250,000.
2.  **The “TriVote” Decision Gate (Step 6):** For a loan to advance, it must receive a "Pass" via approvals from at least two out of the three required stakeholders (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer).
