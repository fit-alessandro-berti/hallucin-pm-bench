### Decision Points

Based on the defined Contoso Airlines flight-refund process, there are three specific points where the process flow is determined by a condition or approval status:

1.  **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**
    *   **Logic:** The triage agent checks the claim against the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.
    *   **Outcome:** Determines if the claim proceeds to the Finance Controller.
2.  **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**
    *   **Logic:** The finance controller signs off using the *EligibilityChecklist*.
    *   **Outcome:** Payment processing may begin only after this step has **succeeded**.
3.  **High-value branch**
    *   **Logic:** Checks if the refund amount is **greater than €1 000**.
    *   **Outcome:** If true, the case proceeds to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (which must include the *AuditTrail*). If false, this step is bypassed.
