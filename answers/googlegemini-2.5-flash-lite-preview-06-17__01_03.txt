Here's a breakdown of Acme Bank's SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process:

**a) Decision Points Summary:**

*   **Tri-Color-Risk-Check:** The loan is assigned a risk rating of Low, Medium, or High based on the inputs from the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow Scorecards.
*   **Conditional Branch (Step 4):** If the risk rating is Low or Medium AND the requested amount is €250,000 or less, then the Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5) is skipped.
*   **Decision-Gate “TriVote”:** The loan passes if at least two out of the three required approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) give their approval.
