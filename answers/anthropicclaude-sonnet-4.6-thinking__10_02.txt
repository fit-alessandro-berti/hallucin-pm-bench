## Notes & Decision Rules

- **Task 2 — Sanctions List Screening:** The Transaction Analyst executes the screening; the Regulatory Liaison is Accountable because sanctions compliance is a regulatory obligation that falls within their remit.
- **Task 3 — KYC Review:** The Transaction Analyst is Consulted (supplies transaction data and logs needed for the review); the Regulatory Liaison solely drives and owns this activity.
- **Task 4 — High-Risk Transaction Approval:** This gate is the Regulatory Liaison's exclusive authority. The Transaction Analyst is Informed so they know whether to proceed to Task 5.
- **Task 5 — Payment Release:** IT Support is Consulted to confirm system readiness before the Transaction Analyst authorises release.
- **Tasks 6 & 7:** IT Support owns both SWIFT transmission and archiving end-to-end; the Regulatory Liaison is Informed at closure per regulatory record-keeping requirements.
