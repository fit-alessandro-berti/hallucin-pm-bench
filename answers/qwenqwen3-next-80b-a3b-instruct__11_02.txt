**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance**

The three worst-performing activities are: **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.

1. **Request_Documents** (avg_wait_time: 150 min, rework_rate: 22.0%, SLA breach: 5.5%) – Extreme queueing and high rework suggest poor customer guidance or unclear document requirements.  
   → *Action:* Implement a dynamic, interactive checklist sent at claim registration to reduce missing/mismatched submissions.

2. **Review_Documents** (avg_processing_time: 25 min, stdev: 9 min, SLA breach: 12.4%) – High variability and SLA breaches indicate inconsistent reviewer competence or unclear standards.  
   → *Action:* Introduce mandatory calibration sessions and a standardized scoring rubric for document reviewers, tracked via audit samples.

3. **Initial_Assessment** (avg_wait_time: 18 min, SLA breach: 3.2%, rework: 1.8%) – While throughput is acceptable, prolonged queueing and notable SLA breaches point to resource bottlenecks or triage delays.  
   → *Action:* Redeploy 2 FTEs from lower-volume activities (e.g., Notify_Customer) to reduce wait times, with weekly tracking of wait time reduction targets.

No other activities show comparable convergence of high wait, rework, or SLA breach. Prioritize these three to reduce overall cycle time and customer frustration.
