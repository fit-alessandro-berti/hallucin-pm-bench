1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs exactly **1 time** in this fragment.
2. There are 18 total logged events, so “Manual_Fraud_Check” represents **5.56%** of all logged events.
3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.
4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:
   - **Temporal bias**: The data covers only a single day (2025-05-01), and fraud patterns may vary over different days or months.
   - **Sample size**: Only 1 instance of “Manual_Fraud_Check” is observed in a small dataset (18 events), making the estimate highly sensitive to random variation.
