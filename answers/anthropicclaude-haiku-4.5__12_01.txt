**The fact is INACCURATE.**

**Justification:**

The claim states that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case. However, the data shows the opposite pattern:

- **Case 1001**: Update_Inventory (08:25:55) occurs *before* Authorize_Refund (08:30:02)
- **Case 1002**: Update_Inventory does not appear at all; Authorize_Refund is followed directly by Refund_Issued
- **Case 1003**: Update_Inventory (10:08:07) occurs *before* Authorize_Refund (10:22:18)

In both cases where both activities are present (1001 and 1003), the sequence is reversed from the claim. Additionally, Case 1002 demonstrates that Authorize_Refund does not always have Update_Inventory immediately after it.
