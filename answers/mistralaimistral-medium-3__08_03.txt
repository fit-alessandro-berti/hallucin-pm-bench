Let's analyze the Petri net to determine whether transition **T5** can fire before **T3** in any reachable marking.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Marking**: Only `p0` has a token (1).
2. **Firing T1**: The first transition that can fire is `T1`, which consumes the token from `p0` and produces tokens in `pa` and `pb`.
   - Marking after `T1`: `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`.
3. **Firing T2b (shortcut)**: From `pa`, we can fire `T2b` (input: `pa`, output: `pd`), which skips `pc` and directly produces a token in `pd`.
   - Marking after `T2b`: `pd = 1`, `pb = 1` (since `pa` is consumed).
4. **Firing T4**: From `pb`, we can fire `T4` (input: `pb`, output: `pe`), producing a token in `pe`.
   - Marking after `T4`: `pd = 1`, `pe = 1`.
5. **Firing T5**: Now, both `pd` and `pe` have tokens, so `T5` can fire (input: `pd`, `pe`; output: `pf`).
   - Marking after `T5`: `pf = 1`.

In this sequence, `T3` never fires because we took the shortcut (`T2b`) and never produced a token in `pc`. Thus, `T5` fires before `T3` is even enabled.

### Shortest Firing Sequence:
The shortest sequence where `T5` fires before `T3` is:
**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

### Formal Explanation of Why This Is Possible:
- `T3` requires a token in `pc`, which is only produced by `T2` (not `T2b`).
- By choosing `T2b` (the shortcut), we avoid producing a token in `pc`, so `T3` is never enabled.
- Meanwhile, `T5` can fire as soon as both `pd` and `pe` have tokens, which can happen before `T3` is enabled (or even possible).

Thus, the answer is **yes**, and the shortest firing sequence is `T1, T2b, T4, T5`.
