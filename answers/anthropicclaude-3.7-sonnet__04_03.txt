# Compliance Decision: No

This trace is not compliant with ruleset R. Here's my analysis of each rule:

## Rule 1: ✓ Satisfied
- `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) both occur exactly once each
- They appear in the correct order (QE before RA)

## Rule 2: ✓ Satisfied
- Case has severity = "High"
- `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA

## Rule 3: ❌ Violated
- `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs after QE but **before** RA is complete
- Rule 3 requires NA to happen only after **both** QE and RA are complete

## Rule 4: ✓ Satisfied
- `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after NA and after VP (which was required by Rule 2)

The trace violates Rule 3 because the notification to authorities happened prematurely, before the Regulatory Affairs review was completed.
