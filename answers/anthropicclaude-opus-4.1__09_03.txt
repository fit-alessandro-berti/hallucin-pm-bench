Based on the provided artifacts, I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity.

**Reason why computation is impossible:**

The event log stub (Artifact A) contains only the header row with column names but no actual data rows - all records have been explicitly redacted for privacy reasons. Without access to the actual event log data containing the start_time and complete_time values for cases where the "Approve Invoice" activity occurs, it is mathematically impossible to calculate any time-based metrics. The cycle time of an activity requires the difference between its complete_time and start_time for each instance, and these temporal values are not present in the redacted log. While Artifact B provides a historical average time between "Approve Invoice" and "Pay Invoice" activities (7.8 days), this represents the waiting time between two different activities rather than the cycle time of "Approve Invoice" itself, which would be the duration from when that single activity starts until it completes.
