**Answer to Question 1:** No, transition **T5** cannot fire before **T3** in any reachable marking.

**Explanation (Question 2):**
For **T5** to fire, both **P2** and **P5** must be marked. However, **P5** is only reachable via **T4**, which requires **P4** to be marked. **P4** is produced by either **T3** (from **P2**) or **T7** (from **P3**, which depends on **T2** from **P1**). Since **T1** splits the initial token into **P1** and **P2**, **T3** must fire to produce **P4** before **T5** can synchronize **P2** and **P5**. Thus, **T3** is a prerequisite for **T5**.

**Minimal sequence example (if T5 could fire first):** Not possible, as explained.
