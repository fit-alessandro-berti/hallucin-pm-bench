Here are the key decision points in Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track process:

**Decision Points:**
1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)**
   - Must verify both ID card AND mobile phone
   - No credit checks performed

2. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**
   - If scores differ by ≤ 2 points → proceed
   - If scores differ by > 2 points → Harmonisation Committee

3. **Amount Threshold Decision**
   - < €15 000 → automatic approval
   - ≥ €15 000 → requires Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)

**Required Documents:**
1. Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
2. Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
3. Latest Income Statement (pay-stub or tax slip)
4. Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
5. Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
6. Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)

Note: This is the non-standard variant from May 2025 that specifically excludes credit bureau checks and requires two independent underwriters instead of one.
