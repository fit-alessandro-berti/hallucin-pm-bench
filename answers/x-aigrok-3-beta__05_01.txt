To ensure claims reach “Triage Claim” (Task_Triage) within 48 hours as per the SLA, I suggest adding a timer boundary event to the “Check Completeness” task (Task_Check). Set the timer to trigger after 24 hours, connecting it via a new sequence flow to “Triage Claim” (Task_Triage), bypassing the “Docs complete?” gateway (GW_Docs) and “Request Missing Docs” (Task_RequestDocs). This ensures that even if documentation is incomplete, the claim moves to triage within the SLA, allowing escalation if needed. This uses existing elements and adheres to the constraint of not adding new tasks.
