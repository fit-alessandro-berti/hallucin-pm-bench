**No**

The statement “Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order” does **not** hold for all cases in the excerpt.

| CaseID | Activity sequence (chronological) | Is Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order? |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| C001 | Receive_Order → Validate_Payment | **Yes** – no activity in between. |
| C002 | Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment | **No** – Pack_Items intervenes. |
| C003 | Receive_Order → Validate_Payment | **Yes** – no activity in between. |
| C004 | Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment | **No** – Check_Fraud intervenes. |

Because in **C002** and **C004** the activity **Validate_Payment** is preceded by another activity (Pack_Items or Check_Fraud), the FACT is **incorrect** for those cases. Thus, the overall claim that the activity always follows immediately after B is invalid.
