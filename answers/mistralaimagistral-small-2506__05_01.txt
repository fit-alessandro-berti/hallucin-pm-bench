**Improvement:** Add a boundary timer event to "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage) with a 48-hour delay. If the activity is not started within 48 hours, trigger an escalation path using a conditional flow (e.g., to an "Escalate Claim" end event or another handler). This ensures the SLA is met without new tasks by leveraging BPMN events and existing flows. Modify the taskâ€™s attributes to include this timer constraint.

*Key points:* No new tasks added; uses boundary event + existing gateways/path. (Reference: Task_Triage, Event_Transformation for timer).
