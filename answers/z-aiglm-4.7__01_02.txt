**Decision Points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**

1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate**
    *   Compares the risk scores (0–9) assigned by the **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**.
    *   **If** scores differ by ≤ 2 points: Proceed to the next step.
    *   **Else**: Escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision before proceeding.

2.  **Amount Threshold Decision**
    *   Evaluates the loan amount requested.
    *   **If** amount < €15 000: The system auto-approves.
    *   **If** amount ≥ €15 000: Proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.

3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**
    *   The board votes to either *approve* or *reject* the application (only occurs if amount ≥ €15 000).
