1) 1 time
2) 5.56%
3) A1002
4) Two sampling-related reasons the monthly frequency estimate is unreliable:
- Very small sample size (18 total events, with only 1 Manual_Fraud_Check) leads to high sampling variance and an unstable extrapolation to monthly frequency.
- The fragment covers a single day/time window and may not be representative of typical monthly patterns (not random/time-rounded sampling), so seasonal or daily/weekly variation is not captured.
