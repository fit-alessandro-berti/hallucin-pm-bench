1) The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” appears **once** in the excerpt.

2) This snippet covers only three cases on 2025‑03‑01 (14 events total), so it is a tiny, time-limited sample of a month-long log. Manual fraud checks occur in only one of those cases (1002), but other days and cases are absent. Activity naming also varies (“Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), so similar steps may be logged under different labels. With such sparse, early-day data and possible label variation, an analyst could under- or overestimate how often manual fraud checks occur across the full month.
