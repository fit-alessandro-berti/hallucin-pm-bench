### Answer  
**No**  

### Justification  
The FACT claims that "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between." However, the event log contains **counterexamples** where other activities intervene between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":  

1. **CaseID C002**:  
   - Sequence:  
     `Receive_Order` (2025-01-03T09:30:00) → **`Pack_Items`** (2025-01-03T09:50:00) → `Validate_Payment` (2025-01-03T10:05:00)  
   - **Violation**: `Pack_Items` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, breaking the "immediately after" requirement.  

2. **CaseID C004**:  
   - Sequence:  
     `Receive_Order` (2025-01-03T10:05:00) → **`Check_Fraud`** (2025-01-03T10:07:00) → `Validate_Payment` (2025-01-03T10:20:00)  
   - **Violation**: `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, breaking the "immediately after" requirement.  

While CaseID C001 and C003 *do* follow the claimed sequence (e.g., C001: `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` with no intermediate activity), the FACT uses the word **"always"**. The presence of **even one counterexample invalidates the claim**. Here, **two counterexamples (C002 and C004)** definitively prove the FACT is inaccurate.  

**Conclusion**: The log evidence contradicts the FACT. Validate_Payment does *not* always occur immediately after Receive_Order.
