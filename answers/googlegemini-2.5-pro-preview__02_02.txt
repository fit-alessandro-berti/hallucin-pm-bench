Okay, let's break down this XES event log fragment.

**Q1 How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**
Looking at the `case` attribute:
*   C001
*   C002
*   C001 (duplicate)
*   C003
*   C002 (duplicate)
*   C003 (duplicate)
*   C001 (duplicate)
*   C002 (duplicate)
*   C003 (duplicate)
*   C002 (duplicate)

The distinct cases are C001, C002, and C003.
**Answer: 3**

**Q2 For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**
Events for case "C002":
1.  Line 2: `concept:name="Receive_Order" time:timestamp="2025-03-01T09:15:10"`
2.  Line 5: `concept:name="Check_Stock" time:timestamp="2025-03-01T09:22:55"`
3.  Line 8: `concept:name="Arrange_Delivery" time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:15:20"`
4.  Line 10: `concept:name="Ship_Order" time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:25:40"`

**Answer: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

**Q3 Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**
Let's find instances of "Ship_Order" and the event immediately before it within the same case:

*   **Case C001:**
    *   Event "Ship_Order": Line 7, `time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:05:10"`
    *   Previous event for C001: Line 3, `concept:name="Check_Stock"`, `time:timestamp="2025-03-01T09:20:05"`
    *   Preceding activity: Check_Stock

*   **Case C003:**
    *   Event "Ship_Order": Line 9, `time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:20:30"`
    *   Previous event for C003: Line 6, `concept:name="Check_Stock"`, `time:timestamp="2025-03-01T09:25:05"`
    *   Preceding activity: Check_Stock

*   **Case C002:**
    *   Event "Ship_Order": Line 10, `time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:25:40"`
    *   Previous event for C002: Line 8, `concept:name="Arrange_Delivery"`, `time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:15:20"`
    *   Preceding activity: Arrange_Delivery

Distinct preceding activities are "Check_Stock" and "Arrange_Delivery".
Alphabetically ordered:
**Answer:**
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
