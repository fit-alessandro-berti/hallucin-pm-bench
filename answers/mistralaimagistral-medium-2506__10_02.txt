Here’s the RACI table adherence to the mandated vocabulary, structured in Markdown:

```markdown
| Task                                           | Responsible       | Accountable       | Consulted       | Informed        |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|

| Archive case file                              | IT Support         | IT Support         | Regulatory Liaison | -           |
```
### Notes:
- Replaced *payment clerk* → **Transaction Analyst**.
- Replaced *compliance officer* → **Regulatory Liaison**.
- Replaced *customer due diligence/CDD* → **KYC Review**.
- Assumed "IT Support" remains as-is (since it wasn’t part of the enforced vocabulary).
- Accountable roles are typically the final authority (e.g., Regulatory Liaison for approvals, IT Support for technical steps).

Structure follows standard RACI conventions, with roles/titles strictly aligned to the mandate.
