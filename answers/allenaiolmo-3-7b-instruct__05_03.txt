Add a `bpmn:timerServiceTask` element wrapping the `Activity_CreateAccount` task with a `bpmn:timeConstraint` attribute set to "48h" to enforce the 48-hour SLA after the "Verify Identity" gateway.

Justification: Wrapping the account creation in a timer service task with a 48-hour time constraint ensures the process meets the SLA without adding new user tasks or parallel flows.
