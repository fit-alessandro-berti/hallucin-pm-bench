MEMORANDUM

Risk Review, Legal Approval and Credit Assessment breach SLA and exhibit the highest waiting times in the process. Together they handle over 2,100 cases (480, 465, and 1,175) and are the main bottleneck. Combined, they exceed the SLA by 660 s (300 s + 300 s + 60 s), extending overall cycle time; these delays increase overall processing time and risk missing client SLAs.

Risk Review: average throughput 600 s vs target 300 s → 300 s over SLA; waiting 480 s. Legal Approval: 900 s vs 600 s → 300 s over SLA; waiting 600 s. Credit Assessment: 300 s vs 240 s → 60 s over SLA; waiting 200 s.

Recommendations
- Add a second risk‑review officer to halve the 480 s waiting, pulling total time under the 300 s SLA.  
- Use pre‑approved legal templates and an extra paralegal to cut the 600 s waiting by ~30 %, meeting the 600 s SLA.  
- Automate credit‑score decisions for low‑risk cases, targeting a 30 % reduction in the 200 s waiting and eliminating the 60 s SLA overrun.
