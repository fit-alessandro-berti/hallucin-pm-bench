Subject: Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time

Analysis of the process-performance snapshot (last 12 months) reveals the top 3 worst-performing activities by waiting time. The ranking is as follows:

1. **Request_Documents**: Average waiting time = 36.5 hours, 95th-percentile waiting time = 120.0 hours. Recommended action: Implement an automated document request system with pre-populated claimant information to reduce waiting time by ≥ 20%.
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Average waiting time = 12.2 hours, 95th-percentile waiting time = 44.0 hours. Recommended action: Streamline the letter generation process by creating standardized templates to cut waiting time by ≥ 20%.
3. **Assess_Liability**: Average waiting time = 7.8 hours, 95th-percentile waiting time = 16.4 hours. Recommended action: Introduce a task management system to prioritize liability assessments and allocate resources more efficiently, reducing waiting time by ≥ 20%.

Implementing these actions will significantly reduce waiting times and improve overall process efficiency.
