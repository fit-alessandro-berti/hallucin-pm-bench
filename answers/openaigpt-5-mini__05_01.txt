Add an intermediate catching timer event on sequence flow f2 (between Task_Receive and Task_Check) with timeDuration="PT48H" (Timer_48h). When the timer fires it should route directly to Task_Triage (replace/branch f2 into Timer_48h â†’ Task_Triage). This guarantees any claim not progressed to Triage within 48 hours of Start_Claim is auto-escalated to Task_Triage without adding new tasks.
