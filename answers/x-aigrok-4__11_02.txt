### Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Insights

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Subject:** Key Underperformers in Claims Handling and Recommended Actions  

Based on the Q1-2025 dashboard, the three worst-performing activities are Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment. These exhibit the highest wait times, rework rates, processing times, variability, and SLA breaches, contributing to throughput drops.

- **Request_Documents** underperforms due to excessive average wait time (150 minutes) and high rework rate (22%), leading to reduced throughput (190 cases/day) and SLA breaches (5.5%). Action: Implement automated reminders for document submission to cut wait time by targeting the 22% rework cases.

- **Review_Documents** underperforms with high average processing time (25 minutes), variability (9 minutes stdev), rework (5.3%), and SLA breaches (12.4%), further lowering throughput (185 cases/day). Action: Introduce AI-assisted review tools to reduce processing time and variability, aiming for a 20% drop in SLA breaches.

- **Initial_Assessment** underperforms from elevated wait time (18 minutes), processing time (12 minutes), and SLA breaches (3.2%) relative to upstream activities. Action: Reallocate staff to peak hours to lower wait time, informed by the 4-minute stdev in processing.

These actions prioritize data hotspots for efficiency gains.
