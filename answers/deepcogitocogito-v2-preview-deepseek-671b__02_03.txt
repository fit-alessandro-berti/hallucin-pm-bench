Okay, let's tackle each question one by one based on the provided event log.

### Question 1: How many distinct cases are present?

I need to go through all the `<event>` tags and list the values of the `case` attribute.

From the log:

1. `case="C456"`
2. `case="C123"`
3. `case="C789"`
4. `case="C456"`
5. `case="C123"`
6. `case="C123"`
7. `case="C456"`
8. `case="C789"`
9. `case="C456"`
10. `case="C123"`

Now, I'll extract the unique case IDs:

- C456 (appears in lines 1, 4, 7, 9)
- C123 (lines 2, 5, 6, 10)
- C789 (lines 3, 8)

That's three unique cases: C123, C456, C789.

### Question 2: For case “C456”, which activity immediately precedes “Ship_Order”?

First, I'll filter all events for case C456 and note their activities and timestamps.

From the log, the events for C456 are:

- `name="Validate_Order" timestamp="2025-05-10T09:20:00+02:00"` (1st line)
- `name="Ship_Order" timestamp="2025-05-10T09:40:00+02:00"` (4th line)
- `name="Pack_Items" timestamp="2025-05-10T09:35:00+02:00"` (7th line)
- `name="Create_Order" timestamp="2025-05-10T09:10:00+02:00"` (9th line)

I notice that there are four events for C456, but let me list them in chronological order based on their timestamps:

1. `Create_Order` at 09:10:00
2. `Validate_Order` at 09:20:00
3. `Pack_Items` at 09:35:00
4. `Ship_Order` at 09:40:00

The question asks which activity immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case C456. From the ordered list, "Pack_Items" comes right before "Ship_Order."

### Question 3: Which activity appears exactly once in the entire fragment?

I'll list all the activities in the entire log and count their occurrences.

From each line (I'll list them in order for clarity but note they might have different cases):

1. `Validate_Order` (C456)
2. `Pack_Items` (C123)
3. `Cancel_Order` (C789)
4. `Ship_Order` (C456)
5. `Ship_Order` (C123)
6. `Create_Order` (C123)
7. `Pack_Items` (C456)
8. `Create_Order` (C789)
9. `Create_Order` (C456)
10. `Validate_Order` (C123)

Now, I'll count the occurrences of each activity:

- `Validate_Order`: Lines 1 and 10 → 2 times
- `Pack_Items`: Lines 2 and 7 → 2 times
- `Cancel_Order`: Line 3 → 1 time
- `Ship_Order`: Lines 4 and 5 → 2 times
- `Create_Order`: Lines 6, 8, 9 → 3 times

From the counts, "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once.
- **Question 1**: 3 distinct cases (C123, C456, C789)  
- **Question 2**: "Pack_Items"  
- **Question 3**: "Cancel_Order"
