Add a boundary timer event with duration PT48H attached to Task_Receive (id="Task_Receive"). Configure it to fire at 48 hours from task initiation. Connect this timer's sequence flow to a new end event (e.g., "End_Escalation"). This ensures claims exceeding the SLA automatically escalate upon timer expiration, leveraging submission-triggered timing without new tasks. Though Task_Receive is brief, the timer starts at process initiation (per flow), monitoring the critical path to Triage. (78 words)
