**Summary:** Introduce a parallel path from Start_Claim with a 48-hour timer leading directly to Task_Triage. This ensures the process abides by the SLA by bypassing the document request step if necessary. The only additions are a parallel gateway and a timer event.

```
Add a parallel gateway after `Start_Claim`. One path follows the original flow to `Task_Receive`, and another goes to a 48-hour timer intermediate event leading directly to `Task_Triage`. This ensures the SLA is met without adding new tasks.
