**Justification:** Attaching an interrupting 48-hour boundary timer (`cancelActivity="true"`) to `Activity_CreateAccount` enforces the SLA deadline by automatically cancelling the stalled service call and routing control to the already-existing — but previously unreachable — `Activity_AMReview`, which already flows onward to `Activity_ActivateAccount`, closing the loop without introducing any new activities.
