Based on Q1‑2025 data, the three worst‑performing activities are:

1. **Request_Documents** – Throughput 190 cases/day (lowest), wait 150 min (longest), rework 22 % (highest).  
   *Action*: Deploy a self‑service document portal with real‑time validation; target <30 min wait and <5 % rework by end‑Q2.

2. **Review_Documents** – Processing 25 min (highest), σ 9 min (highest variability), SLA breach 12.4 % (highest).  
   *Action*: Introduce a standardized review checklist and refresher training; aim for <15 min processing and <3 % SLA breach by mid‑Q2.

3. **Initial_Assessment** – Wait 18 min (third‑highest), SLA breach 3.2 % (third‑highest), rework 1.8 % (moderate).  
   *Action*: Add one temporary FTE and prioritize by claim complexity; target <10 min wait and <1 % SLA breach by Q2.

These actions address the most critical bottlenecks identified in the metrics.
