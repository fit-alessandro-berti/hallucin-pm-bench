The requested metrics cannot be computed from the provided artefacts. The event-log stub contains no actual data rows (all timestamps and case IDs are redacted), leaving no basis to calculate cycle times, standard deviations, or confidence intervals. The SLA catalogue excerpt provides historical averages for the "Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice" interval (7.8 days) but does not include cycle-time data for the "Approve Invoice" activity itself. Without access to the raw event-log data (specifically, start and complete timestamps for "Approve Invoice" instances), no statistical analysis is possible.
