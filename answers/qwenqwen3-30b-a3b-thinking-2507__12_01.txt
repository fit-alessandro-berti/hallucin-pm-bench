The fact is **inaccurate**.  

**Justification**:  
In **Case 1001**, "Update_Inventory" occurs at `2025-03-01 08:25:55` and "Authorize_Refund" occurs at `2025-03-01 08:30:02` â€” meaning "Update_Inventory" happens *before* "Authorize_Refund", contradicting the claim that "Authorize_Refund" **always** occurs *immediately before* "Update_Inventory".  

No other case supports the claim, and **Case 1001 alone disproves it**.
