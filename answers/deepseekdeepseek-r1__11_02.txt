**Memo to COO: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance**  

**1. Worst-Performing Activities**  
- **Request_Documents**: Extreme queueing (150min avg wait) and high rework (22%), causing throughput to drop 29% from prior steps.  
- **Review_Documents**: Long, variable processing (25±9min) drives 12.4% SLA breaches (highest).  
- **Initial_Assessment**: 18min avg wait (3rd highest) and 3.2% SLA breaches suggest capacity strain.  

**2. Root Causes**  
- **Request_Documents**: Rework-driven backlog (22% repeat rate) clogs the queue.  
- **Review_Documents**: Unpredictable processing (high stdev) and rework (5.3%) delay outcomes.  
- **Initial_Assessment**: Inadequate resourcing relative to inflow (270 vs. Register_Claim’s 280/day).  

**3. Recommendations**  
- **Request_Documents**: Implement mandatory document checklists at prior steps to reduce rework.  
- **Review_Documents**: Standardize decision criteria/templates to cut variability.  
- **Initial_Assessment**: Reallocate staff to align with Register_Claim’s throughput, reducing wait times.
