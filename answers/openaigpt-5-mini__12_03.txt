No.

Justification (based on the log):

- Counterexamples:
  - C002: Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05) — Validate_Payment is not immediately after Receive_Order.
  - C004: Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20) — Check_Fraud intervenes.

- For completeness, cases where Validate_Payment does occur immediately after Receive_Order:
  - C001: Receive_Order (09:12) → Validate_Payment (09:15)
  - C003: Receive_Order (09:40) → Validate_Payment (09:44)

Because C002 and C004 show other activities between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, the FACT is incorrect.
