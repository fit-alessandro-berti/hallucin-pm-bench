The fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment.

In Case 1001, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55, and "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 08:30:02, indicating that "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Update_Inventory".

In Case 1003, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, and "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 10:22:18, also indicating that "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Update_Inventory".

Furthermore, in Case 1002, "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 10:18:40, and "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all in this case.

Therefore, based on the event-log fragment, there are cases where "Authorize_Refund" does not occur immediately before "Update_Inventory", but rather after, and cases where "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all. 

Relevant case IDs: 1001, 1002, 1003.
