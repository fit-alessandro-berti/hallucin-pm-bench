Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before **T3**. A shortest firing sequence achieving this is:

**T1 → T4 → T2b → T5**

### Step-by-step validation:
1. **Initial marking**: $ p_0 = 1 $, all others $ = 0 $.  
2. **T1 fires**:  
   - Input: $ p_0 $ (1 token) → consumed.  
   - Output: $ pa = 1 $, $ pb = 1 $.  
   - *Current marking*: $ pa=1, pb=1 $, all others $ 0 $.  
3. **T4 fires**:  
   - Input: $ pb $ (1 token) → consumed.  
   - Output: $ pe = 1 $.  
   - *Current marking*: $ pa=1, pe=1 $, all others $ 0 $.  
4. **T2b fires**:  
   - Input: $ pa $ (1 token) → consumed.  
   - Output: $ pd = 1 $.  
   - *Current marking*: $ pd=1, pe=1 $, all others $ 0 $.  
5. **T5 fires**:  
   - Inputs: $ pd=1 $ and $ pe=1 $ → satisfied.  
   - Output: $ pf = 1 $.  

At this point, **T5 fires before T3** (since $ T3 $ has never fired in this sequence). The sequence contains **4 transitions**, which is the minimal length required to accumulate tokens in both $ pd $ and $ pe $ for $ T5 $’s input conditions.

### Why this works:
- $ T5 $ requires tokens in both $ pd $ and $ pe $.  
- $ pe $ is exclusively produced by $ T4 $ (from $ pb $).  
- $ pd $ can be produced directly by $ T2b $ (from $ pa $), *without requiring $ pc $* (which would necessitate $ T2 $ and $ T3 $).  
- Using $ T2b $ instead of $ T2 \rightarrow T3 $ avoids the dependency on $ T3 $, enabling $ T5 $ to fire earlier.  

This sequence is valid and minimal, as no shorter path exists (at least 4 transitions are needed to activate all required places for $ T5 $).

**Answer:** Yes, with shortest firing sequence: **T1, T4, T2b, T5**.
