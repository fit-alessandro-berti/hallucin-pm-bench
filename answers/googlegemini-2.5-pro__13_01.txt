Based on the 18 log lines provided:

1.  The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs exactly **1** time.
2.  This represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1 event / 18 total events).
3.  The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.
4.  Two sampling-related reasons why this estimate is unreliable are:
    *   **Insufficient Sample Size:** The fragment contains only 4 cases and 18 total events. This sample is too small to provide a statistically meaningful estimate of the true frequency across a full month's worth of data.
    *   **Unrepresentative Time Period:** The data covers only a 5-hour window on a single day (May 1st, 2025). The frequency of fraud checks could vary significantly by time of day, day of the week, or seasonality, none of which can be captured by this brief snapshot.
