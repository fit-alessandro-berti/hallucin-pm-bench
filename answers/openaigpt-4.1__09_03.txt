It is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" from the information given.

Reason: The event-log stub only provides the column headers and not the actual data rows or timestamp values. Without concrete start and complete times for each instance of "Approve Invoice," there is no basis to calculate the duration, variability, or any statistical interval for this activity. Thus, none of the requested metrics can be determined.
