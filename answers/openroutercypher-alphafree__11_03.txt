Subject: Process Efficiency Analysis & Recommendations

Analysis of our loan origination process has identified three critical areas requiring immediate attention:

-   Risk Review exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (50% overage)
-   Legal Approval exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (50% overage)
-   Credit Assessment exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds (25% overage)

All three activities also show high waiting metrics:
-   Risk Review: 480 seconds
-   Legal Approval: 600 seconds
-   Credit Assessment 200 seconds

Recommendations for optimization:
· Risk Review: Implement parallel processing for initial risk checks to reduce sequential dependencies.
· Legal Approval: Establish a pre-screening triage to route more routine offers through expedited channels.
· Credit Assessment: Introduce automated credit scoring algorithms to minimize decision-maker bottlenecks.

This data-driven approach should yield immediate SLA improvements and waiting-time reductions across the pipeline. Addressing these key points will enhance operational efficiency.
