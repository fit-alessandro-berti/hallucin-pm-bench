### Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

The process includes the following key decision points, where progression depends on specific conditions:

- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: If the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤ 2 points, continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC). Otherwise, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision, then continue.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: If the requested amount < €15 000, the system auto-approves. If the requested amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: The board votes to approve or reject the application.
