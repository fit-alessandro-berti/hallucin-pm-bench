No, the fact is not accurate.

In Case 1001: “Update_Inventory” occurs at 08:25:55, and “Authorize_Refund” occurs at 08:30:02 — so “Authorize_Refund” comes *after* “Update_Inventory”, not before.

In Case 1002: “Authorize_Refund” occurs immediately before “Refund_Issued”, but “Update_Inventory” does not occur at all — so the claimed sequence does not apply.

In Case 1003: “Update_Inventory” occurs at 10:08:07, and “Authorize_Refund” occurs at 10:22:18 — again, “Authorize_Refund” comes *after* “Update_Inventory”.

Therefore, “Authorize_Refund” never occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory” in any case; in fact, it consistently occurs after it (when both are present). The fact is false.
