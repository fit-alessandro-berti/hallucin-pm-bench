Add a **non-interrupting boundary timer event** on `Task_Receive` (ID: `Timer_48h`) set to **48 hours**. Connect it via a new sequence flow to `Task_Triage` (ID: `f10`). This ensures claims auto-escalate by skipping completeness checks if the 48-hour SLA is at risk, while preserving all existing activities. The timer won’t disrupt in-progress claims but guarantees timely triage.
