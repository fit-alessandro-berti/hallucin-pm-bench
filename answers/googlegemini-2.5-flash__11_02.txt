3.  **Initial_Assessment**: As an early high-volume stage, its underperformance impacts downstream. It exhibits a high average wait time (18 min), significant processing time (12 min), and a 3.2% SLA breach rate.
    *   **Action:** Streamline assessment workflows and improve initial intake templates to reduce processing time and enhance clarity for next steps.
