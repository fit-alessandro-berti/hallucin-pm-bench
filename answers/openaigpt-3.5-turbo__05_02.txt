    <bpmn:serviceTask id="Task_GrantAccess"   name="Grant System Access"    camunda:dueDate="P2D" camunda:type="external"/>
```

Rationale: Adjusting the due date for the "Grant System Access" task to be completed within 2 days instead of 1 day to align with the overall process timeline and improve SLA compliance.
