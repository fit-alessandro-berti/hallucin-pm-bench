### Decision Points

Based on the Contoso Airlines process description, there are two primary decision gates that determine the flow of the refund claim:

1.  **Pre-Approval Success**
    *   **Location:** Between **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** and **Process_Refund_Payment**.
    *   **Condition:** The **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** activity must succeed. This relies on the prior validation performed by the **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** against the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.
    *   **Outcome:** Payment processing cannot begin until this sign-off is confirmed.

2.  **High-Value Threshold**
    *   **Location:** The **High-value branch** (Step 4).
    *   **Condition:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1,000**?
    *   **Outcome:**
        *   **Yes:** The case must proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (including the *AuditTrail*) before payment.
        *   **No:** The case bypasses the audit review and proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment** after pre-approval.

*(Note: The legacy activity “CustomerService_Agent_Decide” is not part of this process.)*
