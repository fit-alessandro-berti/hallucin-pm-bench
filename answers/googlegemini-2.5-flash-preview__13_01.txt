Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided log fragment:

1.  Exactly how many times does the activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occur in this fragment?
    1

2.  What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)
    5.56% (1 out of 18)

3.  List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.
    A1002

4.  A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.
    This fragment only covers a single day, so it does not account for daily, weekly, or monthly variations in activity frequency.
    The sample size is very small (1 occurrence of the activity in 18 events), which makes any extrapolation to a larger period highly unreliable due to potential randomness and lack of representativeness of the full population of events.
