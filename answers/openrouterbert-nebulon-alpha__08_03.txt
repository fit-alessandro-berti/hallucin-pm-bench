Let's analyze the Petri net to determine if T5 can fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

### Key Observations:
1. **T5's Inputs**: T5 requires tokens in both `pd` and `pe` to fire.
2. **T3's Role**: T3 moves a token from `pc` to `pd`, enabling `pd` for T5.
3. **Dependencies**:
   - `pd` can be populated in two ways:
     - Via T3 (from `pc`, which comes from T2).
     - Via T2b (a shortcut from `pa`, bypassing `pc`).
   - `pe` is populated by T4 (from `pb`), which is independent of `pc`/`pd`.

### Critical Path Analysis:
For T5 to fire before T3, `pd` must be populated **without** T3 firing. This can only happen if `pd` is populated via T2b (the shortcut). Here's how:

1. **T1 fires**: Moves the token from `p0` to `pa` and `pb` (parallel split).
   - Marking: `pa=1, pb=1` (others 0).
2. **T2b fires**: Moves the token from `pa` to `pd` (shortcut).
   - Marking: `pb=1, pd=1` (others 0).
3. **T4 fires**: Moves the token from `pb` to `pe`.
   - Marking: `pd=1, pe=1` (others 0).
4. **T5 fires**: Consumes tokens from `pd` and `pe` to produce `pf`.
   - T5 has fired **before T3** (since T3 never fired in this sequence).

### Shortest Firing Sequence:
The sequence `T1 → T2b → T4 → T5` achieves this. Here, T5 fires before T3 because `pd` is populated via T2b (not T3).

### Why This Works:
- T2b bypasses `pc` entirely, so T3 is not required to populate `pd`.
- T4 populates `pe` independently, so T5 can fire as soon as both `pd` and `pe` are marked.

### Conclusion:
**Yes**, T5 can fire before T3. The shortest firing sequence is:
`T1, T2b, T4, T5`.
