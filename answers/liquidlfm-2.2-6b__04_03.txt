**No** – trace 2025-05-RX17 violates ruleset R.

**Violations and justifications:**

1. **Rule 1 Violation**: The order of `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must be strictly in that order. However, the trace shows `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurring **before** both QE and RA in the execution sequence. Although technically NA doesn’t require QE and RA to pass first, **Rule 3 explicitly states NA must occur only after QE and RA are complete**, and QE and RA are also required in order—this is violated structurally.

2. **Rule 2 Issue (Indirect)**: Since severity = "High", Rule 2 requires `VP_Safety_Approval` to follow QE **and** RA. However, in the trace, `VP_Safety_Approval` is missing and NA precedes all required steps, which makes compliance contextually invalid.

3. **Rule 4 Not Fully Satisfied**: Because NA occurs before RA, and NA must wait for both QE and RA (Rule 3), though the sequence is wrong, `Close_Case` is not demonstrated before NA anyway.

**Key Resolution**: NA cannot occur before QE and RA, and to satisfy Rule 3, both QE and RA must complete before NA. Since NA occurs **before** QE and RA in this trace, and RA is not implied after QE in execution order, **Rule 1 and Rule 3 are violated due to incorrect sequencing**.

Additionally, the absence of `VP_Safety_Approval` (required under Rule 2 for high severity) and early occurrence of NA imply other procedural non-compliance, but the core violations center on Rule 3 and causal sequence in Rule 1 + 4.

Thus, the trace is **non-compliant**.
