No. 

Justification:
• Rule 1 is satisfied because both Quality_Engineer_Review (QE) and Regulatory_Affairs_Review (RA) occur once each, with QE occurring before RA.  
• Rule 2 is satisfied since for a "High" severity case, VP_Safety_Approval (VP) occurs after both QE and RA.  
• Rule 3 is violated because Notify_Authorities (NA) occurs immediately after QE, before RA is complete.  
• Rule 4 is satisfied as Close_Case (CC) occurs after NA (and after VP, as needed).
