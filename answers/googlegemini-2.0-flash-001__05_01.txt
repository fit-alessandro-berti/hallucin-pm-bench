To meet the SLA, add a timer to "Task_Check". After the incoming flow "f2", introduce an intermediate timer event that triggers if 48 hours elapse. This ensures that the claim progresses to triage within the required timeframe or auto-escalates if delayed.

Specifically: insert a timer boundary event on "Task_Check". Connect a new sequence flow from the timer event to "Task_Triage", bypassing the normal flow. This flow represents the "escalation" path if the claim is stuck in completeness checks. This change ensures that all claims reach the "Triage Claim" stage within 48 hours.
