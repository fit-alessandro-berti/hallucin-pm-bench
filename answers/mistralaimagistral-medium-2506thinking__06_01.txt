Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

These are all the task pairs in Process B that are described as running in parallel according to the given process flowchart and instructions.

Thus, the complete list in the required format and order is:

```

Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
```

```markdown
The process analysis identified two pairs of tasks that can run in parallel in Process B.
After ensuring that the tasks within each pair and the pairs themselves are listed alphabetically, the final answer is:
