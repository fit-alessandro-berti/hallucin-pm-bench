### Decision Points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate (Step 5):** A decision is made based on the two independent risk scores.
    *   If the scores from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B** differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues.
    *   If the scores differ by more, the application is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision.

2.  **Amount Threshold Decision (Step 7):** A decision is made based on the loan amount requested.
    *   If the amount is **< €15,000**, the system **auto-approves** the loan.
    *   If the amount is **≥ €15,000**, the application must proceed to the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval**.

3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (Step 8):** For loans of €15,000 or more, the **Micro-loan Board** must vote to either *approve* or *reject* the application.
