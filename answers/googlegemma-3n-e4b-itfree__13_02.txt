1.  The activity “**Manual_Fraud_Check**” occurs **1** time in the excerpt.

2.  a) The activity “**Manual_Fraud_Check**” occurs in **8.33%** of all events. (1 event / 12 events * 100%)

    b) The activity “**Manual_Fraud_Check**” occurs in **8.33%** of all unique cases. (1 case / 12 cases * 100%)

3.  A low-support activity like "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" can mislead analyses because its infrequent occurrence might not reflect typical claim processing. If we generalize from this slice, assuming this is a common step could skew performance or predictive models. The model might overemphasize "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" as a key factor, even though it's only used rarely, leading to inaccurate conclusions and potentially suboptimal business decisions.
