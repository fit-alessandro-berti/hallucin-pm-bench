To determine whether transition T5 can fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking of the given Petri net, we need to analyze the conditions under which each transition can fire and the sequence of firings that lead to these conditions.

### Analysis of Transitions

1. **Transition T1**: Enabled if `p0` has a token. Fires to produce a token in `p1` and `p2`.
2. **Transition T2**: Enabled if `p1` has a token. Fires to produce a token in `p3`.
3. **Transition T3**: Enabled if `p2` has a token. Fires to produce a token in `p4`.
4. **Transition T4**: Enabled if both `p3` and `p4` have tokens. Fires to produce a token in `p5`.
5. **Transition T5**: Enabled if `p3` has a token and `p4` has zero tokens. Fires to produce a token in `p6`.

### Initial Marking
- `p0(1) p1(0) p2(0) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)`

### Firing Sequence Analysis

1. **Firing T1**: `p0(1) -> p1(1) p2(1)`
   - Marking: `p0(0) p1(1) p2(1) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)`

2. **Firing T2**: `p1(1) -> p3(1)`
   - Marking: `p0(0) p1(0) p2(1) p3(1) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)`

3. **Firing T5**: `p3(1) â€“|p4(0) -> p6(1)`
   - Marking: `p0(0) p1(0) p2(1) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(1)`

### Justification

From the initial marking, the only way to enable T5 is to have a token in `p3` and zero tokens in `p4`. This can only happen if T2 fires before T3. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 because T5 requires `p3` to have a token, which can only happen after T2 fires, and T2 requires `p1` to have a token, which can only happen after T1 fires. Since T3 requires `p2` to have a token, which also comes from T1, T3 must fire after T1 but before T5 can be enabled.

### Conclusion

It is **not possible** for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking of this net. The firing sequence shows that T2 must fire before T5, and T2 can only fire after T1, which also enables T3. Therefore, T3 must fire before T5.
