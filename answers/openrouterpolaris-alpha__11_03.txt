Subject: Priority SLA and Waiting-Time Risks in Application Flow

Our performance data highlights three critical activities where SLA breaches combine with elevated waiting times, posing the greatest risk to customer experience and throughput.

First, Legal Approval averages 900s against a 600s SLA, exceeding target by 300s, with 600s of waiting time across 465 cases. Second, Risk Review averages 600s versus a 300s SLA, exceeding by 300s, and incurring 480s of waiting time across 480 cases. Third, Credit Assessment averages 300s versus a 240s SLA, exceeding by 60s, with 200s of waiting time across 1175 cases, making it a high-impact bottleneck given its volume.

Recommended actions:
• Legal Approval: Reallocate capacity to Legal Approval until average time is reduced by at least 300s.  
• Risk Review: Prioritize Risk Review cases with longest waiting time to compress the 480s waiting component.  
• Credit Assessment: Streamline handoff into Credit Assessment to cut its 200s waiting time and recover the 60s SLA gap.
