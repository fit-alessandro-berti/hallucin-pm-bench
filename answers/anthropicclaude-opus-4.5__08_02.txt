## Analysis

**Question 1: Yes**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Question 2: Minimal firing sequence:** `T1, T2, T7, T4, T5`

**Explanation:**

Starting from M0 = {P0}:
1. **T1** fires: consumes P0, produces {P1, P2}
2. **T2** fires: consumes P1, produces P3 → marking {P2, P3}
3. **T7** fires: consumes P3, produces P4 → marking {P2, P4}
4. **T4** fires: consumes P4, produces P5 → marking {P2, P5}
5. **T5** fires: consumes {P2, P5}, produces P6 → marking {P6}

T5 requires {P2, P5}. The path T1→T2→T7→T4 produces P5 while P2 (from T1) remains unconsumed. T3 (which also consumes P2) never fires in this sequence. Thus T5 fires without T3 ever firing.
