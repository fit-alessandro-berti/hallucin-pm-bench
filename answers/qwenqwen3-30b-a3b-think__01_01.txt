### Decision Points in Contoso’s Process:  
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision**: Determine if the passenger is eligible for a refund based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.  
   - **Condition**: Eligibility criteria (e.g., flight details, weather-related disruptions).  

2. **High-value branch**  
   - **Decision**: Check if the refund amount exceeds **€1,000**.  
   - **Condition**: Refund amount > €1,000 → triggers **Senior_Auditor_Review**.
