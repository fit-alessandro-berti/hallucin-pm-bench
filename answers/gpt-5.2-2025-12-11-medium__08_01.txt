Yes.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking \(M_0\) is:
\[
T1 \;\; T2 \;\; T5 \;\; (\text{and only later } T3 \text{ if desired})
\]

Marking evolution:

- \(M_0:\; p0=1\) (others 0).  
  \(T1\) is enabled.

- Fire \(T1\):  
  \(M_1:\; p1=1,\; p2=1\) (others 0).

- Fire \(T2\) (consumes \(p1\), produces \(p3\)):  
  \(M_2:\; p3=1,\; p2=1,\; p4=0\) (others 0).

- At \(M_2\), \(T5\) is enabled because:
  - it has a normal input from \(p3\) and \(p3=1\), and
  - it has an inhibitor arc from \(p4\) and \(p4=0\) (since \(T3\) has not fired yet, \(p4\) is still empty).

- Fire \(T5\):  
  \(M_3:\; p6=1,\; p2=1\) (others 0).

Thus \(T5\) has fired before \(T3\) in this reachable execution.
