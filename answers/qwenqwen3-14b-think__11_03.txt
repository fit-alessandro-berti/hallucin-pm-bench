**Executive Memo**  
To: COO  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Subject: Process Performance Review  

The three worst-performing activities, based on SLA breaches and high waiting times, are:  
1. **Risk Review**: Exceeds SLA by **300s** (600s vs. 300s target) and has the highest waiting time (**480s**).  
2. **Legal Approval**: Exceeds SLA by **300s** (900s vs. 600s target) and has the longest waiting time (**600s**).  
3. **Credit Assessment**: Exceeds SLA by **60s** (300s vs. 240s target) with a waiting time of **200s**.  

**Recommendations**:  
- **Risk Review**: Implement process automation to reduce manual steps, targeting a 20% reduction in throughput time.  
- **Legal Approval**: Introduce a prioritization framework for high-impact cases to reduce waiting time by 15%.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Allocate additional staff during peak hours to address bottlenecks and reduce waiting time by 10%.  

Immediate action is required to align these activities with SLA targets and improve overall efficiency.
