Below are the decision points in Contoso Airlines’ refund process, with the condition tested at each point, the possible outcomes, and the documents required to make that decision.

1) Triage eligibility decision (during Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility)
- Condition: Is the claim eligible for refund?
- Required documents: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport
- Outcomes: If eligible → proceed to Finance_Controller_PreApprove. If not eligible → case is not advanced (refund denied).

2) Finance pre-approval decision (during Finance_Controller_PreApprove)
- Condition: Does the finance controller pre-approve the claim?
- Required documents: EligibilityChecklist (and the RefundRequestForm as source of claim details)
- Outcomes: If pre-approved → continue to next steps (subject to high-value branch). If not pre-approved → refund is not authorized.

3) High-value threshold decision (high-value branch)
- Condition: Is the refund amount greater than €1 000?
- Required documents: RefundRequestForm (amount)
- Outcomes: If > €1 000 → case proceeds to Senior_Auditor_Review (AuditTrail must be included). If ≤ €1 000 → no senior-audit step required.

4) Senior auditor decision (during Senior_Auditor_Review) — applies only for high-value claims
- Condition: Does the senior auditor complete/approve the review?
- Required documents: AuditTrail (must be included); the EligibilityChecklist/RefundRequestForm will be used as supporting material
- Outcomes: If completed/approved → allows Process_Refund_Payment (subject to BankTransferAuthorization). If not → refund is not authorized.

5) Payment gating decision (before Process_Refund_Payment executes)
- Condition: Are all required approvals completed and is the signed BankTransferAuthorization present so payment can be executed?
- Required documents: BankTransferAuthorization, evidence of Finance_Controller_PreApprove (EligibilityChecklist); for high-value claims also evidence of completed Senior_Auditor_Review (AuditTrail)
- Outcomes: If approvals and BankTransferAuthorization are present → Process_Refund_Payment may proceed. If not → payment cannot be executed.
