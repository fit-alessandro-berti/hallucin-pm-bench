**a) Decision Points in Acme’s Small-Business Loan-Approval Process**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome**: Determines the risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) based on the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which then influences whether a Manual-Underwriting-Review is required.  
2. **Conditional Skip of Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 4)**: If the risk rating is Low or Medium **and** the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, the application skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5).  
3. **TriVote Decision Gate (Step 6)**: Requires approvals from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer, with the rule that at least **any two out of the three** approvals are sufficient for the application to proceed.
