### Answers:

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
   - **1 time.**

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
   - Total number of events = 18.  
   - Frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check" = 1.  
   - Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 = **5.56%.**

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  
   - **A1002.**

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   - **Reason 1:** The fragment represents only one day’s worth of data, and the frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check" may vary significantly over time or under different conditions.  
   - **Reason 2:** The sample size is very small (only one occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check") and may not be representative of the true long-term frequency.
