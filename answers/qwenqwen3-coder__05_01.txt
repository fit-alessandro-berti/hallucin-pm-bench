Add an **Intermediate Timer Catch Event** (e.g., `Timer_Escalate`) with a 48-hour delay after `Task_Receive` (between `f2` and `Task_Check`). If the claim hasnâ€™t reached `Task_Triage` within 48 hours, this timer triggers an escalation path leading directly to `Task_Triage`, bypassing further checks. The normal flow from `Task_Check` to `Task_Triage` remains, but now if delays occur, the timer ensures the SLA is respected by forcing the claim into triage automatically. This maintains existing task integrity while enforcing timely processing. Reference: insert `Timer_Escalate` after `Task_Receive`.
