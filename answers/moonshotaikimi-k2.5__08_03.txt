 **Yes.**  
Transition **T5** can fire before **T3** because the token in **pd** can be produced directly by the “shortcut” transition **T2b** (pa → pd) instead of via the longer path **T2** → **T3** (pa → pc → pd).

A shortest firing sequence that enables **T5** without ever firing **T3** is:

1. **T1** (p0 → pa, pb)  
   Marking: pa=1, pb=1  
2. **T2b** (pa → pd)  
   Marking: pd=1, pb=1  
3. **T4** (pb → pe)  
   Marking: pd=1, pe=1  
4. **T5** (pd + pe → pf)  

Thus the ordered list is: **T1, T2b, T4, T5** (or equivalently **T1, T4, T2b, T5**). No shorter sequence can place tokens in both **pd** and **pe** because at least four transition firings are required: one to create the initial split (T1), two to convert the separate branches into the two tokens needed by T5 (T2b for pd and T4 for pe), and finally T5 itself.
