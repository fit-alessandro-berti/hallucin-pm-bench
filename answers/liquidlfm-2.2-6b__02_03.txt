- 4 distinct cases (C456, C123, C789)  
- For case **C456**, **Create_Order** (at 09:00:00) immediately precedes **Ship_Order** (at 09:40:00)  
- **Pack_Items** (initially by C789 at 09:30:00) and **Create_Order** (by both C123 and C456, but unique instances are only one completion by C123 at 09:00:00 among multiple-related signs) — but actually the **only activity unique to one flag** is not single instance, so correction: **only one instance of an activity** is **Create_Order** by C123 at 09:00, which is unique in this fragment if counted by event rows, but if considering distinct time points: **Pack_Items**, **Create_Order** (occurs by C123 and C456), **Ship_Order** appears twice — so **no activity appears exactly once** among event lines, but if counting distinct instances by occurrence (not unique time), then:  
  - **Pack_Items** appears 3 times, **Create_Order** appears 3 times, **Ship_Order** appears 3 times, **Validate_Order** appears once, and **Cancel_Order** appears once.  
  - Therefore, the correct single-activity that appears exactly once **by occurrence** is not possible; instead, there’s a misinterpretation. Rechecking:  
    The line list shows multiple C456/Pack_Items occurrences, but **only one timepoint entry per (case, concept)** is not guaranteed here; however, each event is listed separately. Since **Create_Order** is associated with three events, but counts as one activity, if "appears exactly once" means **only one distinct event line showing that activity**, then no single activity appears only once — but this contradicts the fragment. Closest is **Validate_Order** and **Cancel_Order** each appearing once as a concept and case. But the fragment shows **Validate_Order** at 09:05 and canceled later — but yes, **Cancel_Order** at 09:45 is the only occurrence of “Cancel_Order”.  
- So final answers clarified:

- 4 distinct cases  
- For C456, **Create_Order** (09:00:00) precedes Ship_Order (09:40:00)  
- **Cancel_Order** (C456 case, 09:45:00) appears exactly once in the fragment
