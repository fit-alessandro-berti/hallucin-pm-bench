### Changes Summary

**• Added tasks**  
- "Verify Identity" (id: `Task_VerifyIdentity`) inserted after start event.  
- "Request Additional Documents" (id: `Task_RequestDocs`) added as a new gateway outcome path.  
- "Final Reject" (id: `Task_FinalReject`) added as a replacement for the removed rejection task.  

**• Removed tasks**  
- "Reject Loan" (id: `Task_RejectLoan`) deleted entirely.  

**• Gateway-type changes**  
- Gateway type changed from **Exclusive Gateway** (`exclusiveGateway`) in v1 to **Inclusive Gateway** (`inclusiveGateway`) in v2 (id: `Gateway_Decision`).  
- Outcome paths expanded from "yes/no" (v1) to three named flows: *eligible*, *missing docs*, and *ineligible* (v2), enabling parallelizable paths.

### Key Notes
- **Ignored**: Renaming "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan" (cosmetic).  
- **Structural**: New sequential task ("Verify Identity") and two parallel post-gateway tasks ("Request Additional Documents", "Final Reject") fundamentally alter the process logic.  
- **Gateway Impact**: Inclusive gateway allows multiple concurrent outcomes (e.g., "missing docs" + "eligible"), unlike the XOR behavior of v1.
