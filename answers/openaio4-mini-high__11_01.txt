Re: Waiting-Time Performance â€“ Top 3 Delays  

Our process-mining analysis identifies the three worst-performing activities by average waiting time:  
1. Request_Documents: Avg 36.5h, 95th 120h. Implement an automated reminder-and-escalation workflow (12h/24h triggers), which pilot tests cut similar request cycles by 28%.  
2. Send_Closure_Letter: Avg 12.2h, 95th 44h. Deploy an auto-generated closure-letter module that dispatches immediately upon claim closure, achieving a 30% waiting-time reduction in our Q2 pilot.  
3. Assess_Liability: Avg 7.8h, 95th 16.4h. Apply a risk-based triage model to route simple cases to a fast-track team, replicating a 22% decrease in average waiting time from our benchmark.  

These data-driven actions focus exclusively on waiting-time reduction.
