No, the fact is not accurate.

Justification:
- Case 1001: Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued (Update_Inventory occurs before Authorize_Refund)
- Case 1002: Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued (Update_Inventory does not occur at all)
- Case 1003: Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund (Authorize_Refund occurs after Update_Inventory)

In all three cases where Authorize_Refund appears, it is never immediately followed by Update_Inventory. In fact, in the two cases where both activities exist (1001 and 1003), Update_Inventory always precedes Authorize_Refund, which directly contradicts the claim.
