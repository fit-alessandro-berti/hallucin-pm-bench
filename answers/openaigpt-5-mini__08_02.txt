Q1: Yes.

Q2: Minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Explanation (≤120 words): T1 AND-splits into P1 and P2. Fire T2 then T7 then T4 to produce P5 via the P1→P3→P4→P5 path without touching P2. Since P2 remains from T1, T5 can now synchronise on {P2,P5} and fire before T3 (which would consume P2).
