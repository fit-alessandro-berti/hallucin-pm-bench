The three worst-performing activities—based on SLA breaches and high waiting times—are Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment. Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds (600 avg. throughput time), with 480 seconds of waiting time. Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds (900 avg. throughput time), with 600 seconds of waiting time. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds (300 avg. throughput time), with 200 seconds of waiting time. These inefficiencies significantly delay the end-to-end process.  

- **Risk Review**: Implement a real-time alert system for cases exceeding 200 seconds in waiting time to trigger escalation and reduce bottleneck impact.  
- **Legal Approval**: Introduce a dedicated legal review team for high-priority cases to reduce average throughput time and meet SLA.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Integrate automated validation tools for 30% of low-risk applications to reduce reliance on manual review and lower wait times.
