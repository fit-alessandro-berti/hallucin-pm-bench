**Answer: No**

**Justification:**
1. **Rule 1 (QE and RA order):** Violated. `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), which is correct, but `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs between them, violating the requirement that both QE and RA must complete before any other actions (except those allowed by other rules).
2. **Rule 2 (VP for High severity):** Satisfied. `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA.
3. **Rule 3 (NA after QE and RA):** Violated. NA occurs after QE but before RA, which is not allowed.
4. **Rule 4 (CC after NA and VP):** Satisfied. `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after NA and VP.

The trace fails due to violations of Rules 1 and 3.
