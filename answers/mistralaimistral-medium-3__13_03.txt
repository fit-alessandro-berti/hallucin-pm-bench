1️⃣ The exact activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because:
- The snippet is a tiny fraction of March 2025 data, lacking statistical significance.
- Activity labels vary (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), which could split similar activities in the full log.
- The excerpt may overrepresent certain paths (e.g., CaseID 1001 has no manual checks, while 1002 does).
- Without context on total cases or process variants, the analyst cannot infer true prevalence from this sample.
