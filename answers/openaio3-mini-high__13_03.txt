1️⃣ The exact string “Manual Fraud Check” appears exactly once in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst examining only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks in the full month-long log because this small sample may not represent all process variants. The excerpt covers only a few cases and a limited timeframe. Other cases in the complete log might follow different paths, include additional manual checks, or use alternative naming for similar activities. Thus, the limited view provided could either understate or overstate how common manual fraud checks are in the broader dataset.
