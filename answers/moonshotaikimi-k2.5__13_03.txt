2️⃣ The snippet contains only three cases spanning ~1.5 hours on a single day—an extremely small, potentially non-representative sample of a month-long log. With just one occurrence observed, the analyst cannot determine if manual checks are rare exceptions or frequent events. Additionally, the log shows naming inconsistencies (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), suggesting "Manual Fraud Check" might have variants or aliases in the full dataset that are invisible here. The snippet may also lack seasonal patterns, bulk processing periods, or specific fraud campaigns that would affect manual check frequency across March 2025.
