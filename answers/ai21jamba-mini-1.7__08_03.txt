Yes, it is **possible** for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in some reachable marking.

### Explanation and Shortest Firing Sequence

The Petri-net analyst can confirm this as follows:

1. **Initial Marking**:
	- p0 = 1, all other places = 0.
2. Place p0 has sufficient tokens for transition T1. After firing T1:Marking: pa = 1, pb = 1, other places = 0.
3. At this marking, transitions T2a and T2b are enabled due to the split structure. Additionally, transition T4 is enabled due to the presence of a token in pb.
4. Let’s consider firing both T2a (normal path) and T4:Marking after T2a: pc = 1, pd = 1, other places = 0.Marking after T4: pe = 1, other places = 0.
5. Transition T3 is now enabled due to the presence of a token in pc. Firing T3 produces:Marking after T3: pc = 0, pd = 1, other places = 0.
6. Transition T5 can be enabled if there are tokens in pe and pd. Since T4 ensures pe has a token and firing T3 with pc = 1 (possible from an earlier shortcut T2b which skips pc) redirects flow into pd, these conditions can be met.

Thus, one **shortest firing sequence** to make T5 precede T3 is:**T1 → T4 → T2b → T3 → T5** (or variations that achieve the same ordering).

### Formal Explanation of Possibility

- The net allows **nondeterministic choice** between T2a and T2b after T1.
- Transition T3 depends on pc being marked, which can occur either directly via T2a or indirectly via T2b's shortcut path.
- Transition T4 enables pe, and T3 (if taken early, skipping pc) ensures pd is marked, meeting T5's input requirements.

Hence, the **ordering T5 before T3** is possible due to the net's structure and firing choices.
