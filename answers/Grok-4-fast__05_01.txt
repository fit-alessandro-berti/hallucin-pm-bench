To enforce the 48-hour SLA for reaching Task_Triage, introduce a parallel gateway after Start_Claim. Retarget sequence flow f1 to this gateway, with one outgoing flow to Task_Receive and a new outgoing flow to an intermediate timer event set to PT48H duration. Connect the timer event to a new end event named "Auto-Escalated". This parallel branch monitors total time from submission; if expired without progressing, the process ends in escalated state while allowing normal completion if faster.
