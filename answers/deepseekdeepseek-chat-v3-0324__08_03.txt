Let's analyze the net step by step to determine if T5 can fire before T3.

Initial marking: [p0=1, others=0]

1. Only T1 is enabled initially. Firing T1 produces tokens in pa and pb:
   [pa=1, pb=1]

Now possible transitions:
- T2 (consumes pa, produces pc)
- T2b (consumes pa, produces pd)
- T4 (consumes pb, produces pe)

For T5 to fire before T3, we need to reach a marking where both pd and pe have tokens (inputs to T5) without pc having a token (which would require T3 to have fired).

Possible paths:
a) Fire T2 first (normal path):
   - T2: consumes pa, produces pc → [pb=1, pc=1]
   - Then only T4 is enabled: consumes pb, produces pe → [pc=1, pe=1]
   Now we need pd for T5, which would require T3 to fire first (consuming pc), so T5 cannot fire before T3 in this path.

b) Fire T2b first (shortcut path):
   - T2b: consumes pa, produces pd → [pb=1, pd=1]
   - Now T4 is enabled: consumes pb, produces pe → [pd=1, pe=1]
   Now T5 is enabled (inputs pd and pe) and T3 is not enabled (requires pc which is empty).

Thus, the shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3 is:
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5

This sequence reaches a marking where T5 can fire without T3 having fired.

Answer: Yes, it is possible. One shortest firing sequence is:
T1, T2b, T4, T5
