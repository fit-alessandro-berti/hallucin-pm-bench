**Decision points in the Contoso Airlines refund workflow**

| # | Decision point (as named in the process) | What is decided | Relevant documents used to make the decision |
|---|------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** | Whether the claim is eligible for a refund (checked against the flight manifest and weather conditions). | • FlightManifest  <br>• WeatherReport |
| 2 | **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** | Whether to sign‑off on the eligibility checklist, i.e., to pre‑approve the refund. | • EligibilityChecklist (produced after step 1) |
| 3 | **High‑value threshold (refund > €1 000)** | Whether the claim must go to the senior‑auditor branch (the “high‑value” path). | (No separate document – the decision is a simple numeric test on the refund amount.) |
| 4 | **Senior_Auditor_Review** (only for high‑value claims) | Whether to approve the high‑value refund, producing an audit trail. | • AuditTrail (generated by the senior auditor) |

*No other explicit decision points exist in the defined process.* The final steps (Process_Refund_Payment, Issue_Confirmation_Letter) are purely execution activities that depend on the approvals having been obtained.

2. **FlightManifest** – used by the triage agent to verify the flight details.  
3. **WeatherReport** – used by the triage agent to confirm that the flight was affected by adverse weather.  
4. **EligibilityChecklist** – completed by the triage agent and signed by the finance controller to record pre‑approval.
