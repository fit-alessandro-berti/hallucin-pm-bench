1️⃣ The activity **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **once** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002).  

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate its frequency because this snippet only includes 3 cases. If the full log has many more cases where "Manual Fraud Check" is absent or labeled differently (e.g., "Manual Review"), the snippet’s limited scope could lead to an inaccurate perception of rarity or commonality. Additionally, the snippet may omit cases where manual checks occur but are not explicitly labeled, or it might not represent the full temporal distribution of activities in the month.
