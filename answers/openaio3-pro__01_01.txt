Decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process

1. Eligibility validation  
   • Who decides: Triage_Agent  
   • Question: “Is the claim eligible according to flight data and weather conditions?”  
   • Possible outcomes: Eligible → continue; Not eligible → stop / reject.  
   • Documents consulted:  
     – RefundRequestForm (input from customer)  
     – FlightManifest  
     – WeatherReport  

2. Finance pre-approval  
   • Who decides: Finance_Controller  
   • Question: “Does the claim satisfy the EligibilityChecklist?”  
   • Possible outcomes: Pre-approved → continue; Not approved → stop / reject.  
   • Documents consulted:  
     – EligibilityChecklist (completed and signed)  

3. High-value branching (> €1 000)  
   • Who/what decides: System rule based on refund amount recorded in the claim.  
   • Question: “Is the refund amount greater than €1 000?”  
   • Possible outcomes:  
     – Yes → route case to Senior_Auditor_Review.  
     – No  → skip auditor review and move directly to Process_Refund_Payment.

   • Documents consulted:  
     – AuditTrail  

5. Payment readiness check (implicit gate before Process_Refund_Payment)  
   • Who/what decides: Finance team or automated control.  
   • Question: “Have all required approvals been completed and is a signed BankTransferAuthorization present?”
