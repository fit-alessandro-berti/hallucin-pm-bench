Okay, operating strictly on the Acme Bank Micro-loan Fast-Track (May 2025) knowledgebase.

**Decision Points:**

1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate:** After Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B assign their scores, a decision is made based on whether their scores differ by 2 points or less.
2.  **Amount Threshold Decision:** Based on the loan amount requested, a decision is made whether further approval from the Micro-loan Board is required.

**Required Documents:**

*   Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
*   Proof of Address (â‰¤ 3 months old)
*   Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
*   Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
*   *Note: The Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet is generated by the Underwriters, not necessarily submitted upfront, but it exists at Step 4. It might be considered implicit in the decision process.*
*   Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)
*   *Note: The system prompts for Proof of Address and Latest Income Statement during the RMA step.*
