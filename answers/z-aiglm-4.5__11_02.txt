**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance: Critical Bottlenecks & Actions  

The three worst-performing activities are:  

1. **Request_Documents:**  
   *Why:* Severe bottleneck with extreme wait time (150 mins), highest rework rate (22.0%), and elevated SLA breaches (5.5%). Low throughput (190/day) exacerbates delays.  
   *Action:* Automate document requests to reduce manual handling errors causing rework and expedite initiation.  

2. **Review_Documents:**  
   *Why:* Highest SLA breaches (12.4%) and rework (5.3%), driven by high processing variability (stdev 9 mins) and slow handling (avg 25 mins).  
   *Action:* Standardize review guidelines and implement targeted training to reduce inconsistency and processing time.  

3. **Initial_Assessment:**  
   *Why:* Significant wait time (18 mins) and SLA breaches (3.2%), indicating congestion early in the process despite moderate throughput (270/day).  
   *Action:* Allocate temporary additional assessors during peak periods to clear queue backlogs.  

These actions directly address the primary data-driven inefficiencies causing delays and quality failures.
