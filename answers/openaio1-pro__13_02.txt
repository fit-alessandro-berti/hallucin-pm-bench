1) It appears exactly once.  

2a) Out of 48 total events, that is (1 ÷ 48) × 100 = 2.08%.  
2b) Out of 12 unique cases, it is present in just 1, i.e. (1 ÷ 12) × 100 = 8.33%.  

3) Because “Manual_Fraud_Check” appears in only one of the 12 cases, it represents a very small fraction of the events. Overemphasizing or ignoring this rare activity can produce incorrect performance estimates and predictions—e.g., inflated mean waiting times or misleading fraud‐check patterns. A minimal number of occurrences also undermines the reliability of average durations or transition probabilities. Consequently, building or validating predictive models from such sparse data risks distorting the overall process picture.
