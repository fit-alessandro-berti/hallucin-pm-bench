1) The requested value cannot be derived.

2) The provided event log does not include timestamps or elapsed-time fields for the activities, so the duration of the "Review Contract" activity (or any other activity) cannot be calculated. Only the sequence of activities and the resources involved are visible in the log. To determine the average cycle time, we would need the actual timestamps or durations for each occurrence of the activity.
