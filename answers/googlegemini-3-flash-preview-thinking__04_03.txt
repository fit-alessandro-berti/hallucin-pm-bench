**No**

**Justification:**
*   **Rule 1 (Satisfied):** `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurred before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA).
*   **Rule 2 (Satisfied):** Since severity is "High," `VP_Safety_Approval` occurred after both QE and RA.
*   **Rule 3 (Violated):** `Notify_Authorities` occurred after QE but **before** RA. The rule states it must not occur until *after* both QE and RA are complete.
*   **Rule 4 (Satisfied):** `Close_Case` occurred after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
