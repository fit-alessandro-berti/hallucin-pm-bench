**Memo**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process‑Performance Analyst  
**Date:** Q1‑2025 Performance Review  

The three activities with the most severe performance gaps are:

1. **Request_Documents** – avg_wait_time_min of 150 (the highest in the process) and a rework_rate_pct of 22.0 % (five‑times the next highest). The long queue and frequent repeat requests indicate a bottleneck in document collection.  
   → **Action:** Deploy a mandatory, templated request checklist with automated validation to cut rework to <5 % and reduce average wait to ≤30 min.

2. **Review_Documents** – avg_processing_time_min 25, stdev 9 (the greatest variability), and sla_breach_pct 12.4 % (the highest). The combination of long, unpredictable work and high defect rate points to inconsistent review criteria.  
   → **Action:** Introduce a standardized review template and decision‑tree tool, targeting a 40 % reduction in processing time (≈15 min) and a drop in SLA breaches to <5 %.

3. **Initial_Assessment** – wait 18 min, processing 12 min, rework 1.8 % and sla_breach_pct 3.2 %. Although not extreme in a single metric, the cumulative effect creates a moderate drag on throughput.  
   → **Action:** Integrate real‑time data from Register_Claim to auto‑populate assessment fields, aiming to cut wait to <10 min and rework to <0.5 %.

Implementing these data‑driven changes will improve flow, lower rework, and reduce SLA breaches across the Claims Handling process.
