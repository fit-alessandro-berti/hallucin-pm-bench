The user asks about a Petri net PN-8. The initial marking M0 = { P0 } (i.e., one token in P0).

Places: P0 (1), P1 (0), P2 (0), P3 (0), P4 (0), P5 (0), P6 (0). So initially, only P0 has a token.

Transitions: T1: {P0} → {P1, P2} // AND-split, meaning it consumes one token from P0 and produces one token in P1 and one token in P2. So T1 needs one token in P0. After firing, P0 becomes empty, P1 becomes 1, P2 becomes 1.

T2: {P1} → {P3}
T7: {P3} → {P4}
T3: {P2} → {P4}
T4: {P4} → {P5}
T5: {P2, P5} → {P6} // synchronising join: consumes one token from P2 and one token from P5, produces one token in P6.

We need to answer two questions:

**Question 1:** In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3?

**Question 2 (bonus):** If yes, give minimal firing sequence; if no, explain why no such sequence exists. Limit ≤ 120 words.

First, we need to understand the dependencies.

The Petri net is a typical AND-split AND-join.

- T1 is an AND-split: from P0 to P1 and P2. So after T1 fires, we have tokens in P1 and P2.

- T2 consumes from P1, produces P3.

- T7 consumes from P3, produces P4.

- T3 consumes from P2, produces P4.

- T4 consumes from P4, produces P5.

- T5 requires one token in P2 and one token in P5, produces P6.

Goal: Determine if T5 can fire before T3. That is, can we find a reachable marking where we have at least one token in P2 and one token in P5, and we can fire T5 before we fire T3 (i.e., before we fire T3 to get P4, etc.)

But note that T3 requires a token in P2. So if we have not fired T3, we must have a token in P2. Similarly, T5 requires a token in P2 and a token in P5. So we need both P2 and P5 to have tokens before T5 can fire.

Thus, after T1, we have P2 token(s). So we can use the P2 token.

Now, can we get a P5 token before firing T3? Let's explore.

After T1, we have P1 and P2 tokens.

We could fire T2: T2 requires P1, consumes it, produces P3. So after T2, we have P3.

Then T7: can fire if we have P3. So we can fire T7: P3 → P4. So after T2 and T7, we have P4.

Now we have P4, we can fire T4: P4 → P5. So after T2, T7, T4, we have P5. So after T1, we could have fired T2, T7, T4 to get P5. But we haven't fired T3. And we have P2 token(s) still. So at that point, we have P2 and P5. Then T5 can fire. So yes, T5 can fire before T3.

But we need to check if there is any cyclic behavior that prevents it. Let's examine the net more thoroughly.

The structure: T1 is before T2, T7, T3. T2 and T3 produce P3 and P4 respectively, but both go to P4 after T7 and P4 after T3? Actually T2 goes to P3, which then must go to P4 via T7. T3 goes directly to P4. So both T2 and T3 produce P4 eventually. But they are in parallel. The tokens are not exclusive; they can co-exist.

Thus, the net is not a choice; it's an AND-split. So after T1, we have both P1 and P2 tokens. Then we can choose to fire either T2 or T3 (or both) in any order, as long as we have the required tokens.

We can fire T2 first: T2 requires P1, which is present. So we can fire T2 → P3. Then we can fire T7 → P4. Then we can fire T4 → P5. Now we have P2 (still) and P5. So T5 can fire. So the answer to Q1 is yes.

But is there any scenario where we cannot get P5 before firing T3? That depends on the possible firing sequences. Since we can choose to fire T2 first, we can.

Thus Q1: yes.

Now Q2 (bonus): we need a minimal firing sequence (ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it.

We need to find a minimal sequence that leads to a state where P2 and P5 tokens exist, and T5 can fire before T3 is fired.

What is the minimal? It likely means the shortest firing sequence that yields that state.

We need to find a firing sequence where T5 fires before T3.

One minimal sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Let's simulate:

Initial: M0 = {P0}. Token count: P0=1, others 0.

1. Fire T1: consumes P0, adds P1 and P2. So now: P0=0, P1=1, P2=1. (Others 0)

2. Fire T2: requires P1. It consumes it, adds P3. So now: P0=0, P1=0, P2=1, P3=1.

3. Fire T7: requires P3. Consumes it, adds P4. So now: P0=0, P1=0, P2=1, P3=0, P4=1.

4. Fire T4: requires P4. Consumes it, adds P5. So now: P0=0, P1=0, P2=1, P3=0, P4=0, P5=1.

Now, at this state, we have P2=1 and P5=1. So T5 can fire. Is T3 fired? No, we haven't fired T3 yet. So T5 is before T3. This sequence has length 5 transitions.

Is there any shorter sequence? Let's check.

Could we fire T1, T2, T4, T5? Let's try:

1. T1: P0→P1,P2.

2. T2: P1→P3.

3. Then fire T4: need P4. But we only have P3. So we need T7 to convert P3 to P4. So T4 after T7 is needed.

Thus, to get P5, we must go through P3, T7, P4, T4.

Thus the sequence T1, T2, T7, T4 is necessary to get P5. So minimal length to get both P2 and P5 is at least 4 transitions: T1 (creates P2), T2 (creates P3), T7 (creates P4), T4 (creates P5). That's 4 steps. So the sequence above is minimal.

Alternatively, could we fire T3 after T1 before T5? T3 only consumes P2 and produces P4. Then we could fire T4 to get P5. But that would be after T5. So not relevant.

Thus minimal sequence: [T1, T2, T7, T4]. Actually we need to fire T5 after that, so the sequence is [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5].

But the question: "give one minimal firing sequence (as an ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it". Since the demonstration is that T5 can fire before T3, we can use any sequence where T5 fires before any T3. So minimal sequence is [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]. That's length 5.

But is there a shorter sequence? Let's see if we could skip T2 and T7, and just fire T3 to get P4, then T4 to get P5. But we need to get P2 token. After firing T1, we have P2. So we could fire T3: P2→P4. Then fire T4: P4→P5. So sequence: T1, T3, T4, T5. Let's simulate:

1. T1: P0→P1,P2. (P1=1, P2=1)
2. T3: P2→P4. (P2=0, P4=1)
3. T4: P4→P5. (P4=0, P5=1)
Now we have P2? No, it's gone. So T5 cannot fire because it requires P2. So T5 can't be fired before T3 in that sequence.

Alternatively, we could fire T1, T3, T7, T4, T5. That's longer.

So the shortest sequence where T5 fires before T3 is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. That's length 5.

But could we fire T5 after T1 but before T3? The key is that we need both P2 and P5. We have P2 after T1. To get P5, we need either T2→T7→T4 (which we have), or T3→T4 (which we don't, because we need P4). We could also fire T7 after T2 and T1. So T7 is needed.

Thus minimal sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Alternatively, we could do T1, T2, T4, T5? No, T4 requires P4.

Thus answer.

But we must ensure minimal: is there any sequence of 4 transitions that leads to P2=1 and P5=1 before T3? Let's check.

We need to get P5 without using T3. So to get P5, we need P4, which can be produced by T7 (consuming P3) or T3 (consuming P2). But to get P3, we need T2. So we need T2 to produce P3. So we need T2. So the minimal path to get P5 is: T1, T2, T7, T4. That's 4 transitions. At that point, we have P2=1, P5=1. So T5 can fire. So the sequence of 4 transitions: T1, T2, T7, T4. But note that after these 4, T5 hasn't fired yet. So the sequence that demonstrates T5 before T3 is actually T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. So we need to include T5 in the sequence. So minimal length to demonstrate the ability to fire T5 before T3 is 5. There is no way to fire T5 with only 4 transitions because T5 requires both P2 and P5, and we need at least T1 to create P2, and then something to create P5; we need T2 (to get P3), T7 (to get P4), T4 (to get P5). So that's 4 transitions for T2, T7, T4, plus T1 (makes P2). So T1, T2, T7, T4, T5 is 5.

But maybe there is a different path: after T1, we have P2 and P1. Could we fire T3 first? That would get P4, then we could fire T4 to get P5. But then we have P2 consumed, so no P2 left. So T5 can't fire after T3. So we need to fire T3 later. So we must not fire T3 before T5.

Thus minimal sequence is indeed T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

But note that the question is "In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3?" The answer is yes. Then the bonus: "If your answer is yes, give one minimal firing sequence (as an ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it". So they want a sequence where T5 fires before T3.

Thus the minimal such sequence is [T1, T2, T7, T4] (where T5 hasn't fired yet). Wait, no: the sequence must include T5. The question asks for a sequence that demonstrates it. So we need to show that T5 can fire before T3. So we need a state where T5 can fire and T3 hasn't been fired. So we need to include the firing of T5 after the earlier steps. The minimal sequence is: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

But we need to ensure that we haven't fired T3 yet. Indeed, we haven't. So that's a valid demonstration.

Alternatively, is there a sequence of 5 transitions where T5 fires before T3? That includes T1. So the sequence is exactly that.

But maybe the question wants the minimal firing sequence that leads to the state where T5 can fire before T3 (i.e., the minimal sequence to get both P2 and P5). The sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4] is minimal for the intermediate state, but doesn't include T5. The question: "give one minimal firing sequence (as an ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it". The phrase "minimal firing sequence" could refer to the minimal sequence that includes T5 before T3. So it's ambiguous. But we can interpret as the minimal sequence that leads to a state where T5 can fire before T3. In that case, we need to include the firing of T5. So the minimal sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

But maybe they want the minimal sequence of transitions that can be on the order of T5 before T3, meaning T5 fires before any T3, but we can have T1, T2, T7, T4, and then we can fire T5. So the minimal number of transitions before the first T5 is 4 (T1, T2, T7, T4). But the question says "give one minimal firing sequence (as an ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it". It might be just a sequence that shows T5 can fire before T3, not necessarily that the sequence is exactly the minimal number of transitions before T5. It could be the minimal sequence that includes T5 before T3, which is 5 steps.

We can also consider alternative sequences: T1, T3, T4, T5. But that fails to fire T5 before T3 because T3 is before T5. So not valid.

Another alternative: T1, T2, T7, T3, T4, T5. But T3 is after T5? Actually T3 is after T7, but before T4? We could fire T5 after T3? Let's see: after T1, we have P1 and P2. Fire T7 to get P4, then fire T5? No, T5 requires P5, not available. So need T4. So T5 is after T4. So T3 cannot be before T4 if we want P5.

Thus the only way to fire T5 before T3 is to fire T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Thus answer.

Now check if there is any other scenario where T5 could fire before T3 with a different path. For example, after T1, could we fire T3 to get P4, then fire T4 to get P5, then fire T5? But that would be after T3. So no.

Thus answer is yes, minimal sequence is [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5].

But maybe the question wants the minimal firing sequence to get the condition for T5 to fire before T3, which is the minimal number of transitions to have both P2 and P5. That is T1, T2, T7, T4 (4 transitions). But they ask for a sequence that demonstrates it. So we need to include the firing of T5. So the sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Given the limit of 120 words, we can be concise.

Thus answer:

Yes. After T1 we have P2 and P1. Firing T2, T7 and T4 yields a P5 token while P2 remains. Firing T5 then is possible. A minimal sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5 (5 steps). No shorter sequence can achieve T5 before T3, because T5 needs a P5 token which requires at least T2, T7, T4 to be fired, and T1 to create P2.

Thus answer.

Now let's double-check the net model to ensure no hidden dependencies or constraints.

The net: P0 → T1 → P1, P2.

P1 → T2 → P3.

P3 → T7 → P4.

P2 → T3 → P4.

P4 → T4 → P5.

P2, P5 → T5 → P6.

Check the initial marking: M0 = {P0}. So we can fire T1. This yields P1 and P2.

Now, the net is safe? No, but safe doesn't matter. It's not bounded.

Now, can T5 fire before T3? Yes, as described.

Now, is there any scenario where T5 could fire before T3 but T3 hasn't fired at all? Yes.

Now, the question: "In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3?" The answer is yes. So Q1 is yes.

Now, Q2: Provide a minimal firing sequence.

Thus answer: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Now, we need to check if there's any alternative minimal sequence that is shorter? Could we skip T2? To get P5, we need P4. P4 can be obtained via T3 or T7. If we use T3, we need P2. So we need T1 (creates P2). Then we need to fire T3 (creates P4), then T4 (creates P5). That's T1, T3, T4, T5. But that uses T3, which is before T5. But we want to fire T5 before T3. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, we could fire T1, then T2, but instead of T7, could we fire T3? No, because we need P4 for T4. So we need T7 to get P4.

Alternatively, we could fire T1, then T2, then T3? But to fire T3 we need P2 (still present). That would produce P4, then T4 to produce P5. But then T3 is before T5, violating the condition that T5 fires before T3.

Thus minimal sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Alternatively, could we fire T1, then T2, then T7, then T5? No, because T5 needs P5, which we don't have. So need T4.

Thus answer is correct.

Now let's consider the possibility that the question might be interpreted differently: "In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3?" This could be interpreted as: Is there any reachable marking where T5 can fire and T3 cannot fire (i.e., T3 cannot fire because it lacks a token)? In other words, can T5 fire in a marking where T3 is dead? But that's not the usual interpretation. Usually, "fire before" means in the sequence, not in a state.

Thus the answer is yes.

Now, we need to write the answer concisely, within 120 words.

Thus:

**Answer:**

Yes. After firing T1, we have tokens in P1 and P2. Firing T2 consumes P1 → P3, then T7 consumes P3 → P4, and finally T4 consumes P4 → P5. At this point we have a token in P2 and one in P5, so T5 can fire before T3 ever fires. A minimal demonstration sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5 (5 steps). No shorter sequence can achieve T5 before T3, because T5 requires a P5 token which needs at least T2, T7 and T4, and a P2 token which only appears after the initial T1.

Thus answer. That is within 120 words.

Now, check the format: The user wants plain text. I will answer in a single block.

I need to ensure I use the correct transition names: T1, T2, T7, T3, T4, T5 in the sequence.

Thus final answer:

Yes. After firing T1, we have tokens in P1 and P2. Firing T2, then T7, then T4 yields a P5 token while P2 remains, so T5 can fire before T3. A minimal firing sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5 (5 steps).

Yes. After firing T1, the net has a token in P2 and still retains P0 (which later disappears). Firing T2 produces P3, T7 converts P3 to P4, and T4 creates P5. At this point P2 and P5 both hold tokens, so T5 can fire before T3 ever fires. A minimal demonstration is the sequence **T1, T2, T7, T4, T5** (5 steps). No shorter sequence can achieve T5 before T3, because T5 requires a P5 token (obtained via T2, T7, T4 and P2) and a P2 token (created by the initial T1).
