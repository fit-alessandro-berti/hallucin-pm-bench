## Answer

**The requested value cannot be derived from the data provided.**

### Explanation

1. **Timestamps and elapsed-time fields have been redacted** from the event log. Without any duration or timestamp data attached to the "Review Contract" events (or any other events), it is impossible to compute how long that activity took in any individual case — and therefore impossible to compute an average across cases.

2. **The historical benchmark does not help.** It supplies average durations for three other activities (*Receive Renewal Request*, *Negotiate Terms*, *Legal Sign-off*), but:
   - "Review Contract" is **not among them**.
   - Even if it were, the benchmark is explicitly noted as coming from a **different customer segment in FY-2023** and **not drawn from this log**, so it could not be used as a substitute for actual measured values in these cases.

### Bottom line
To answer this question you would need the original, un-redacted timestamp or duration columns for the "Review Contract" activity rows in the log.
