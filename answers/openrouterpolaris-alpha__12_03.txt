1. No.

2. Justification (by CaseID):

- C001: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items  
  - Here, Validate_Payment does occur immediately after Receive_Order.

- C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment  
  - Here, Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, so the statement is violated.

- C003: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order  
  - Here, Validate_Payment does occur immediately after Receive_Order.

- C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items  
  - Here, Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, so the statement is violated.

Since in cases C002 and C004 there is at least one activity between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, the claim that Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order is not accurate.
