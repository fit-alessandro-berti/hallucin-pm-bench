1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1** time in this fragment.

2. There are 18 logged events in total.
   (1 / 18) * 100 = 5.555...
   Rounded to two decimal places, this represents **5.56%** of all logged events.

3. The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:
    *   **Limited Timeframe:** The fragment only covers events from a single day (2025-05-01). This is too short a period to reliably estimate a *monthly* frequency, as the occurrence of manual fraud checks could vary significantly by day of the week, week of the month, or other factors not captured in this single-day sample.
    *   **Small Sample Size:** The fragment contains a very small number of cases (4 cases) and only one instance of "Manual_Fraud_Check". This small sample size makes it prone to wide fluctuations and not representative of actual overall frequency.
