### RACI Matrix for FinCo Order-to-Cash Workflow

The following RACI matrix outlines responsibilities for the process activities. Rows represent the key activities, and columns represent the roles. RACI definitions:
- **R**: Responsible (performs the work)
- **A**: Accountable (ultimately owns the outcome and approves)
- **C**: Consulted (provides input or expertise)
- **I**: Informed (kept updated on progress/outcomes)

| Activity          | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application | R/A                 | I                       | -                  | -               |
| KYC Review        | C                   | R/A                     | -                  | -               |
| Order Vetting     | R/A                 | C                       | -                  | -               |
| Payment Clearance | I                   | -                       | R/A                | -               |
| Record Update     | A                   | -                       | C                  | R               |
| Notify Customer   | R/A                 | -                       | -                  | I               |

**Notes on Assignments**:
- Assignments are derived directly from the process description, mapping legacy steps to approved terminology (e.g., KYC Review for customer verification, Order Vetting for data checks).
- Dashes (-) indicate no involvement.
- In cases of overlap (e.g., AM's dual R/A in initial steps), the role drives the activity while ensuring accountability.
