### 2️⃣ Why Analysts Might Misestimate Manual Fraud Checks From This Snippet 

An analyst viewing only this snippet might overestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because this small sample includes one manual fraud check and two automatic checks: however, it does not illustrate broader patterns. The log excerpt covers only a limited, three-hour window and three cases. Manual checks may be rare or triggered selectively under specific risk thresholds. Without full-month data, seasonal variations, volume trends, and routing rules governing when to use manual versus automatic reviews remain unseen, potentially leading to skewed assumptions about overall manual check prevalence.
