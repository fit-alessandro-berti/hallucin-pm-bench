**Answer:** No  
**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1:** Satisfied. QE and RA occur once each in the correct order (QE â†’ RA).  
- **Rule 2:** Satisfied. VP_Safety_Approval occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3:** Violated. `Notify_Authorities` occurs **before** Regulatory_Affairs_Review is complete.  
- **Rule 4:** Satisfied. Close_Case occurs after both NA and VP.  

The trace fails due to the violation of Rule 3.
