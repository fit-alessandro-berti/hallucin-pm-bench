### Decision Points

*   **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: Evaluates the difference between the risk scores assigned by **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**. If scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues; otherwise, it escalates to the **Harmonisation Committee**.
*   **Amount Threshold Decision**: Evaluates the loan amount. If **amount < €15 000**, the system auto-approves. If **amount ≥ €15 000**, the process proceeds to the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval**.
*   **Final Micro-loan Board Approval**: The **Micro-loan Board** votes to either *approve* or *reject* the application for amounts ≥ €15 000.
