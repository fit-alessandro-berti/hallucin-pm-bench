Non-compliant  

**Justification:**  
1. **Rule 2 violation**: After Expedite_Flag (activity 4), Risk_Assessment (activity 9) **does not occur before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods (activity 8)**, as required.  
2. **Rule 3 violation**: After Goods_Received (activity 6), Three_way_match (activity 10) **takes four activities** (Movement to Quality, Ship_Goods, Risk_Assessment) to complete, exceeding the ≤2 activity limit.  
3. **Rule 4 violation**: Activity Ship_Goods (activity 8) is executed by **Logistics** (role), and it is directly followed by Risk_Assessment (activity 9) executed by Risk_Manager (role). However, the rule specifically prohibits any Intern role following a CFO role. Here, the sequence **Intern (activity 7)** directly follows CFO (activity 3), violating Rule 4.
