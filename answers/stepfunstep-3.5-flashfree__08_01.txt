Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:**  
1. T1 (parallel split)  
2. T2 (p1 → p3)  
3. T5 (p3 –|p4 → p6)

**Justification:**  
After T1 fires, tokens are placed in p1 and p2. Firing T2 consumes the token from p1 and produces a token in p3. At this point, p3 = 1 and p4 = 0 (since T3 has not fired yet). T5 requires p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0 (inhibitor arc from p4), so it is enabled and can fire before T3. This sequence demonstrates T5 firing before T3.
