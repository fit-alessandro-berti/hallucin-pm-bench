Yes, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

To fire **T5**, the net requires one token in **pd** and one token in **pe**. While the "normal" path (T2 $\rightarrow$ T3) requires firing T3 to populate **pd**, the net provides a shortcut via transition **T2b**, which moves a token from **pa** directly to **pd**, bypassing the need for T3.

**Shortest firing sequence:**
1. **T1** (Marks pa, pb)
2. **T2b** (Consumes pa, marks pd)
3. **T4** (Consumes pb, marks pe)
4. **T5** (Consumes pd, pe; marks pf)

(Note: T2b and T4 can be interchanged in the sequence; both result in a length of 4).

**Sequence Analysis:**
*   **Initial:** [p0: 1]
*   **Fire T1:** [pa: 1, pb: 1]
*   **Fire T2b:** [pb: 1, pd: 1] (T3 has not fired)
*   **Fire T4:** [pd: 1, pe: 1] (T3 has not fired)
*   **Fire T5:** [pf: 1] (**T5 has fired while T3 has fired 0 times**)
