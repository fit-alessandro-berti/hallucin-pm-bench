Yes – T5 can fire before T3.

One concrete firing sequence starting from the initial marking M0 is

1. T1 (p0 → p1 + p2)  
   Marking M1 : p1 = 1, p2 = 1, all other places 0

2. T2 (p1 → p3)  
   Marking M2 : p3 = 1, p2 = 1, p4 = 0, all other places 0

3. T5 (p3 –|p4 → p6) (enabled because p3 has a token and p4 is still empty)  
   Marking M3 : p2 = 1, p6 = 1, all other places 0

In this run transition T5 fires before any occurrence of T3.  
Therefore it is indeed possible for T5 to precede T3 in some reachable marking.
