**Justification:**

The FACT is inaccurate because there are specific cases where other activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":

*   **Case C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` $\rightarrow$ `Pack_Items` $\rightarrow$ `Validate_Payment`. The activity "Pack_Items" occurs in between.
*   **Case C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` $\rightarrow$ `Check_Fraud` $\rightarrow$ `Validate_Payment`. The activity "Check_Fraud" occurs in between.
