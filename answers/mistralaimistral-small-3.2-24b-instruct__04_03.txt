**Answer: No**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1 Violation**: The trace has `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) followed by `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), which satisfies the order requirement. However, `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs between QE and RA, violating the requirement that both QE and RA must complete before NA (Rule 3).

2. **Rule 2 Satisfied**: Since severity is "High," `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA, which is correct.

3. **Rule 3 Violation**: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) happens after QE but **before RA**, violating the rule that NA must occur only after both QE and RA are complete.

4. **Rule 4 Satisfied**: `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after NA and VP, which is correct.

The trace fails due to Rule 1 (order of QE and RA) and Rule 3 (NA occurring prematurely).
