Impossible to compute: Artefact A contains only the schema and no event rows, so there are zero observed executions of activity “Approve Invoice” with start_time and complete_time from which to derive per-instance cycle times; therefore the mean (in hours), standard deviation, and a 95% confidence interval are undefined for this dataset. The SLA figure (≈7.8 days from Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice) is a different metric (inter-activity lead time, not activity cycle time) and from a different source period, so it cannot be used as a proxy.
