**Question 1.** 
Yes.

**Question 2 (Bonus).** 
A minimal firing sequence is: **T1, T2, T7, T4, T5**.

**Explanation:**
Firing T1 splits the flow, depositing tokens into both P1 and P2. To fire T5, we need tokens in P2 and P5. Rather than firing T3 (which would consume the required P2 token), we leave the P2 token untouched and advance the P1 token. Firing T2 routes the token to P3, T7 moves it to P4, and T4 advances it to P5. At this point, places P2 and P5 both hold a token, fully enabling the synchronising join T5. T5 successfully fires before T3 is ever executed.
