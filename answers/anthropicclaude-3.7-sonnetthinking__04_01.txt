# Analysis of Trace 24-EXP

**Non-compliant**

1. Rule 2 violation: The trace contains "Expedite_Flag" (event #4), which means "Risk_Assessment" must occur before the first "Ship_Goods". However, "Ship_Goods" (event #8) occurs before "Risk_Assessment" (event #9).

2. Rule 3 violation: After "Goods_Received" (event #6), "Three_way_match" must be completed within the next two activities. The activities following "Goods_Received" are "Move_to_Quality" (event #7) and "Ship_Goods" (event #8). However, "Three_way_match" appears much later as event #10, after "Risk_Assessment" (event #9), which exceeds the allowed distance of 2.

The trace does properly follow Rules 1, 4, and 5, but the violations of Rules 2 and 3 make the overall process non-compliant with rule set P2P-2025.R1.
