Let's analyze the possibility of transition **T5 firing before T3** in the given Petri net.

### Key Observations:
1. **T5's enabling condition**: T5 requires **p3 to have a token** and **p4 to have zero tokens** (due to the inhibitor arc from p4).
2. **T3's role**: T3 produces tokens in **p4**. If T3 has not fired, **p4 must be empty** (since no other transition adds tokens to p4).
3. **T4's role**: T4 consumes tokens from **p3 and p4**, but it cannot fire unless both p3 and p4 have tokens. Thus, T4 does not interfere with T5's enabling condition unless T3 has already fired.

### Firing Sequence Where T5 Fires Before T3:
Here is a concrete sequence where T5 fires before T3:

1. **Initial marking**: p0(1), others(0).
2. Fire **T1**: Consumes p0, produces p1 and p2.
   - Marking: p1(1), p2(1), others(0).
3. Fire **T2**: Consumes p1, produces p3.
   - Marking: p2(1), p3(1), others(0).
   - Now, T5 is enabled because:
     - p3 has a token (required for T5).
     - p4 has zero tokens (inhibitor arc condition satisfied).
4. Fire **T5**: Consumes p3, produces p6.
   - Marking: p2(1), p6(1), others(0).
   - T5 has fired, and T3 has not yet fired.

### Conclusion:
**Yes**, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3. The sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** achieves this, as shown above. In this sequence, T3 never fires, and T5 fires while p4 is empty.
