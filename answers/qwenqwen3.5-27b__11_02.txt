Analysis identifies three critical under-performing activities:

1. **Request_Documents**: The primary bottleneck. It has the highest wait time (150 min) and rework rate (22.0%), causing throughput to drop from 280 to 190 cases/day.
*Action:* Automate document triggers to reduce manual rework.

2. **Review_Documents**: The main SLA driver. It records the highest processing time (25 min), variability (stdev 9 min), and SLA breach rate (12.4%).
*Action:* Implement standardized checklists to reduce processing variance.

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Impacts early flow. It holds the second-highest wait (18 min) and processing time (12 min), with a 3.2% SLA breach rate exceeding upstream peers.
*Action:* Allocate additional capacity during peak intake to clear queues.

Addressing these will stabilize throughput and reduce SLA breaches.
