**Decision Points in Contoso’s Flight-Refund Process**

1.  **Eligibility Validation** – The triage agent decides whether the claim is eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport* (activity: **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**).
2.  **High-Value Threshold Check** – The process evaluates if the refund amount is **greater than €1 000**. If true, the case must be routed to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (activity: **High-value branch**).
