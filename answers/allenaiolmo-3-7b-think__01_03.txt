### Explanation:  
- **Decision Points:**  
  - The first decision occurs during the **Tri-Color-Risk-Check** (step 3), where the risk rating determines whether manual underwriting (step 5) is skipped.  
  - The second decision is the **TriVote gate** (step 6), requiring a majority approval (2/3) from three officers for final approval.  

- **Documents:**  
  - Listed in the order they first appear in the process steps. For example:  
    - The three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) are inputs to step 3 and thus required upfront.  
    - The **ID Matrix Declaration** (step 8) is a new document introduced at that stage, even though the *signed* Offer Sheet 77 (from step 7) is already required. Only the first occurrence of each document is listed.
