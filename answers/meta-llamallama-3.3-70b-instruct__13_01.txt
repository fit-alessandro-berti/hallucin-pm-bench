## Step 1: Determine the number of occurrences of the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check"
The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs only once in the given log fragment, specifically in case A1002 at 2025-05-01T10:50:00.

## Step 2: Calculate the percentage of all logged events that "Manual_Fraud_Check" represents
To find the percentage, divide the number of occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check" by the total number of logged events and then multiply by 100. The total number of logged events is 18. So, (1 / 18) * 100 = 5.56% when rounded to two decimal places.

## Step 3: Identify the case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check"
The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is A1002.

## Step 4: Provide two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable
1. **Insufficient Sample Size**: The fragment only contains 18 log lines, which is a very small sample size to estimate the monthly frequency of an event like "Manual_Fraud_Check". A larger, more representative sample would be needed to make reliable estimates.
2. **Lack of Representative Period**: The log fragment covers a very short period (from 2025-05-01T09:00:00 to 2025-05-01T14:05:00), which is less than a day. This is not representative of a full month, and extrapolating from such a short period could lead to inaccurate estimates due to factors like daily, weekly, or monthly patterns in fraud check occurrences that are not captured in the fragment.

The final answer is: 
1. Exactly how many times does the activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occur in this fragment? 
1
2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.) 
5.56
3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”. 
A1002
4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable. 
1. Insufficient Sample Size 
2. Lack of Representative Period
