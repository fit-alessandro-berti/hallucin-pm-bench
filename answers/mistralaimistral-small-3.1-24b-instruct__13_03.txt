1️⃣  The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs once.

2️⃣  An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because this small log excerpt includes only three cases. Informative conclusions should be based on a larger sample size and more cases, ideally the complete month-long event log. Given a minuscule dataset, the presence of a manual fraud check might give an incorrect impression of its overall prevalence. For an informed estimation, the whole event log needs to be analyzed.
