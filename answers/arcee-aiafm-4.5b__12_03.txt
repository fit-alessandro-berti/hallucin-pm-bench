1. No

2. Justification:
The event-log excerpt shows several instances where "Validate_Payment" occurs after "Receive_Order," but not immediately in every case. Specifically:

- C001: "Receive_Order" at 09:12, "Validate_Payment" at 09:15
- C002: "Receive_Order" at 09:30, "Validate_Payment" at 09:50
- C003: "Receive_Order" at 09:40, "Validate_Payment" at 09:44
- C004: "Receive_Order" at 10:05, "Validate_Payment" at 10:20

In all these cases, there are activities in between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," so the statement that "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after 'Receive_Order,' with no other activities in between" is incorrect.
