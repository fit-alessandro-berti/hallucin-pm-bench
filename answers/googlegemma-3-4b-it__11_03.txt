Subject: Urgent Action Required: Process Performance Analysis – Key Bottlenecks

To: COO, Orion Credit

This memo outlines critical performance issues impacting our application processing times, based on recent data analysis. The “Receive Application” activity exhibits the most significant challenges, with an average throughput time of 45 seconds and an average waiting time of 10 seconds, resulting in a delay exceeding the target SLA of 60 seconds. Similarly, the “Verify Identity” activity averages 120 seconds of throughput time and 80 seconds of waiting time, exceeding the 90-second SLA by 30 seconds. The “Credit Assessment” activity also presents a major concern, consistently taking 300 seconds with an average waiting time of 200 seconds – a breach of the 240-second SLA by 60 seconds. Finally, “Risk Review” demonstrates a substantial performance gap with an average throughput time of 600 seconds and a waiting time of 480 seconds, exceeding the 300-second SLA by 300 seconds. 

To address these issues, I recommend the following:

*   For “Receive Application,” implement a standardized data validation process to reduce the average throughput time to within the target SLA.
*   For “Verify Identity,” streamline the identity verification process by automating a portion of the checks, aiming to reduce the average waiting time.
*   For “Credit Assessment,” explore opportunities for increased staffing or process automation to reduce the average throughput time.

Sincerely,

Orion Credit – Senior Process-Performance Analyst
