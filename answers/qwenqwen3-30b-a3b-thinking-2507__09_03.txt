Cannot compute the average cycle time for activity "Approve Invoice" because Artefact A (the event log) contains only column headers with all timestamps and case data redactedâ€”no actual duration values or numerical data are available for analysis. Artefact B provides the average time *between* "Approve Invoice" and "Pay Invoice" (7.8 days), but this is not the cycle time of the "Approve Invoice" activity (which requires its own start-to-complete duration), and the artefacts lack any data to calculate this metric.
