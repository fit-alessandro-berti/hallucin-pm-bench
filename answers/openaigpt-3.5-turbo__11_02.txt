**Executive Memo**

Dear COO,

After analyzing the Q1-2025 performance dashboard for our Claims Handling process, I have identified the three worst-performing activities:

1. **Request Documents**: This activity has a high average wait time of 150 minutes, leading to delays in processing. To improve this, we should implement an automated system for document retrieval to reduce waiting times.

2. **Review Documents**: With a high processing time of 25 minutes and a sizeable rework rate of 5.3%, the review of documents is a bottleneck. We should invest in training programs to improve the efficiency and accuracy of document reviews.

3. **Initial Assessment**: Despite a decent throughput, the high average wait time of 18 minutes and a SLA breach rate of 3.2% indicate inefficiencies. Conducting a thorough review of the assessment process to streamline it and reduce wait times is recommended.

Recommendations:
- Implement document retrieval automation for **Request Documents**
- Provide training programs to improve efficiency in **Review Documents**
- Review and streamline the **Initial Assessment** process

These actions will help address the weaknesses in these activities and improve overall process performance.

Best regards,
