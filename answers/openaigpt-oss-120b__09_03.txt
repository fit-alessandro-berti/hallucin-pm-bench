I cannot compute the average cycle time of “Approve Invoice”, its standard deviation, or a 95 % confidence interval from the supplied artefacts. The only information about the event log is a header description without any actual rows or timestamp values, which means there are no observed start‑ and completion‑times for the activity. Without concrete observations, none of the required statistical measures can be derived.
