1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1 time** in this fragment.  
2. This single occurrence represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1 out of 18 events).  
3. The case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.  
4. Two reasons why this estimate is unreliable:  
   - **Small Sample Size**: The fragment only includes four distinct cases (A1001, A1002, A1003, A1004). A small number of cases does not adequately represent the broader population, leading to potential over- or underestimation of the true frequency of manual fraud checks.  
   - **Limited Timeframe**: The data is confined to a single day (2025-05-01). Monthly frequency estimation requires data spanning multiple days or weeks to capture variations in workload, seasonal effects, and other temporal factors that could influence the frequency of manual fraud checks.
