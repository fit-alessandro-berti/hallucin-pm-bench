**EXECUTIVE MEMO â€“ Q1 2025 Claims Handling Performance**

**1. Request_Documents**  
- **Issue**: Lowest throughput (190/day), extremely high wait time (150 min), and highest rework rate (22%).  
- **Cause**: Severe bottleneck and inefficiency in document collection.  
- **Action**: Automate document request triggers and implement a customer portal for real-time uploads.

**2. Review_Documents**  
- **Issue**: High processing time (25 min), significant variability (stdev = 9), and elevated SLA breaches (12.4%).  
- **Cause**: Complex, inconsistent review process causing delays.  
- **Action**: Introduce standardized review checklists and AI-assisted document validation tools.

**3. Initial_Assessment**  
- **Issue**: High wait time (18 min), moderate SLA breaches (3.2%), and above-average rework (1.8%).  
- **Cause**: Variability in initial triage contributes to downstream delays.  
- **Action**: Deploy decision trees or rules-based routing to reduce assessment variability.

These actions target root causes and align with performance trends across the process.
