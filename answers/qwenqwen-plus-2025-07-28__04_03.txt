**No**

Justification:

- **Rule 1 (QE then RA, each once)**: **Violated**. While both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occur, they are **out of order**. QE occurs first (correct), but RA occurs *after* `Notify_Authities`, which violates the required sequence (QE â†’ RA).

- **Rule 3 (NA after QE and RA)**: **Violated**. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs *before* `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), but it must occur only after *both* QE and RA are complete. Since RA has not occurred when NA is executed, this rule is violated.

- **Rule 2 (VP after QE and RA if severity = High)**: **Satisfied**. The severity is "High", and `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA, so this rule is fulfilled.

- **Rule 4 (CC after NA and VP if applicable)**: **Satisfied**. `Close_Case` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` and after `VP_Safety_Approval`, as required.

However, due to violations of **Rule 1** and **Rule 3**, the trace is **not compliant**.
