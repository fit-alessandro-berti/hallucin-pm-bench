### Decision Points in Contoso’s Process
The process includes one explicit decision point, which determines the path based on refund amount:

- **High-value branch decision**: After **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**, check if the refund amount is greater than €1 000. If yes, the case proceeds to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (including the *AuditTrail*). If no, the case skips this step and proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.

No other decision points are defined in the process.

### Required Documents
The following documents and artefacts are required across the process:

- *RefundRequestForm* (used in **Customer_Submit_Claim**).
- *FlightManifest* (used in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**).
