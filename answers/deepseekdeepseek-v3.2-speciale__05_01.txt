Introduce a parallel gateway after Start_Claim (id: PG_SLA). One branch continues to Task_Receive (redirect f1). The new branch leads to an intermediate timer catch event (Timer_48h, duration PT48H). After the timer, add an exclusive gateway (GW_Escalation) evaluating a process variable `triageReached`. Modify Task_Triage to output `triageReached=true`. If `triageReached` is false, a message throw event (Escalate) sends an auto‑escalation notification. The branch then ends. This ensures SLA enforcement without additional tasks.
