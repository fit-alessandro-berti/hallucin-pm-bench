The fact is **not accurate**.

* **Case 1001** – the sequence is `... Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund …`. Here **Update_Inventory precedes** Authorize_Refund, not the reverse, and they are not adjacent.
* **Case 1002** – the case contains `Authorize_Refund` but **does not contain** `Update_Inventory` at all, so the “immediately‑before” relationship cannot hold.
* **Case 1003** – the sequence is `... Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund …`. `Authorize_Refund` occurs **after** `Update_Inventory` (and after another activity), again not immediately before it.

Since in none of the three cases does **Authorize_Refund** occur immediately before **Update_Inventory**, the claim is false.
