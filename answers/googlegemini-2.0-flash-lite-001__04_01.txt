Non-compliant

1.  **Rule 1 violation:** The "PO\_Amount" is €12,300, exceeding the threshold. There are two "Approve\_PO" activities, one by "Procurement\_Officer" (line 2) and the next by "CFO" (line 3), *before* "Issue\_PO" (line 5), hence rule 1 is observed.
2.  **Rule 2 violation:** The trace contains "Expedite\_Flag" (line 4). As the rule states "Risk\_Assessment" must proceed the first occurrence of "Ship\_Goods". "Risk\_Assessment" is at line 9, "Ship\_Goods" is at line 8, violating this part of rule 2.
3.  **Rule 3 violation:** The activity "Goods\_Received" (line 6) is followed by "Move\_to\_Quality" (line 7) and subsequently by "Ship\_Goods" (line 8) and later by "Three\_way\_match" (line 10). "Three\_way\_match" is at a distance of 4, violating rule 3 (distance ≤ 2).
4.  **Rule 4 observation:** No CFO to Intern transition is happening in the trace.
5.  **Rule 5 observation:** The last activity is "Archive\_Record" (line 11).
