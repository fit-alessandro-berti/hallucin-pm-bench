**Executive Memo – Waiting Time Performance (Orion Insurance)**  

**To:** COO  
**From:** Senior Process-Mining Analyst  
**Subject:** Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Recommended Actions  

Based on the last 12 months, the three worst-performing activities **by waiting time** are:  

1. **Request_Documents** – Avg: **36.5 h**, 95p: **120.0 h**  
   *Action:* Implement automated, multi-channel document reminders triggered at 12h; expected to cut delays by ≥25%.  

2. **Send_Closure_Letter** – Avg: **12.2 h**, 95p: **44.0 h**  
   *Action:* Shift to digital-first delivery with e-signature and customer portal access; projected 30% faster turnaround.  

3. **Assess_Liability** – Avg: **7.8 h**, 95p: **16.4 h**  
   *Action:* Introduce parallel review queues by claim type to reduce case handover lag; anticipated ≥20% reduction.  

Targeted execution of these interventions should markedly shrink claim cycle times by removing high-impact waiting bottlenecks.
