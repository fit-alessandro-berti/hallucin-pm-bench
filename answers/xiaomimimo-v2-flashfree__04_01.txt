Non-compliant
1. Rule 2: The activity `Risk_Assessment` occurs **after** the first `Ship_Goods` (at index 9 vs 8), whereas the rule requires it to occur **before**.
2. Rule 4: The activity `Move_to_Quality` (Intern) directly follows `Goods_Received` (Warehouse_Clerk). The rule prohibits an activity executed by the role **Intern** from directly following an activity executed by the role **CFO**. However, if the trace is evaluated for strict role adjacency, checking the sequence from the CFO activity (index 3): `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO) is directly followed by `Expedite_Flag` (System). If there are no intermediate activities between CFO and Intern, this rule holds. **Correction**: Re-reading the trace, `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO) is followed by `Expedite_Flag` (System), then `Issue_PO` (System), then `Goods_Received` (Warehouse_Clerk), then `Move_to_Quality` (Intern). Since `System` is between `CFO` and `Intern`, the "directly follow" condition is technically met between CFO and System, and System and Intern. Therefore, Rule 4 is **Compliant**.
   *Correction*: The activity `Move_to_Quality` (Intern) immediately follows `Goods_Received` (Warehouse_Clerk). Rule 4 states: "No activity executed by the role **Intern** may **directly follow** an activity executed by the role **CFO**." The sequence `CFO` -> `System` -> `System` -> `Warehouse_Clerk` -> `Intern` means Intern does not directly follow CFO. Therefore, Rule 4 is **Compliant**.

The definitive violation is **Rule 2**.
