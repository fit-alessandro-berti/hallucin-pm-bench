1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.

2. Total events = 18.  
   Percentage = \( \frac{1}{18} \times 100 \approx 5.56\%\).  
   So it represents **5.56%** of all logged events (rounded to two decimals).

3. The case identifier containing “Manual_Fraud_Check” is: **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons the monthly frequency estimate is unreliable:

   - **Very limited and non-representative time window:** All events are from a single day (2025-05-01) and only between 09:00 and 14:05. This short slice may not reflect how often manual fraud checks occur over different days or weeks in a full month.
   - **Tiny sample size (few cases and events):** The fragment contains only 4 cases and 18 events, with just 1 occurrence of “Manual_Fraud_Check”. Such a small sample gives a highly unstable estimate of the true monthly frequency.
