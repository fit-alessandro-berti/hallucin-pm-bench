Attach an interrupting boundary timer event **Timer_48h** (timeDate = `${Start_ClaimTimestamp + PT48H}`) to **Task_RequestDocs**; connect its outgoing flow directly to **Task_Triage** (reuse `f6`). This auto-escalates any claim still awaiting documents once 48 hours from submission elapse, guaranteeing the token reaches **Task_Triage (Task_Triage)** within the SLA while preserving existing work steps.
