Let's analyze whether transition **T5** can fire before **T3** in any reachable marking of this Petri net.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Marking**: Only `p0` has a token (`p0(1)`), all other places are empty.
2. **T1 (Parallel Split)**: Fires first, moving the token from `p0` to `p1` and `p2` (i.e., `p1(1)` and `p2(1)`).
3. **T2 and T3**: These transitions consume tokens from `p1` and `p2`, respectively, and produce tokens in `p3` and `p4`.
   - `T2`: `p1 → p3`
   - `T3`: `p2 → p4`
4. **T5 (Inhibitor Arc)**: Requires:
   - A token in `p3` (normal arc).
   - **No token in `p4`** (inhibitor arc from `p4`).
5. **T4 (Synchronizing Join)**: Requires tokens in both `p3` and `p4`.

### Can T5 Fire Before T3?
For **T5** to fire before **T3**, the following must hold:
- `p3` must have a token (so `T2` must have fired).
- `p4` must **not** have a token (so `T3` must **not** have fired yet).

#### Firing Sequence Where T5 Fires Before T3:
1. **Initial Marking**: `p0(1)`.
2. Fire **T1**: `p0(1) → p1(1) + p2(1)`.
   - Now: `p1(1)`, `p2(1)`.
3. Fire **T2**: `p1(1) → p3(1)`.
   - Now: `p2(1)`, `p3(1)` (and `p4` is still empty).
4. Fire **T5**: `p3(1)` (and `p4` is empty, satisfying the inhibitor arc).
   - Now: `p2(1)`, `p6(1)` (and `p3` is empty).

This sequence is valid:
- `T5` fires **before** `T3` because `T3` never fires in this sequence.
- The inhibitor arc condition (`p4` empty) is satisfied when `T5` fires.

### Justification:
- After `T1` and `T2`, `p3` has a token and `p4` is empty, enabling `T5`.
- `T3` does not need to fire for `T5` to fire in this case.
- Thus, **yes**, `T5` can fire before `T3`.

### Concrete Firing Sequence:
`T1 → T2 → T5`
(Resulting marking: `p2(1)`, `p6(1)`).
