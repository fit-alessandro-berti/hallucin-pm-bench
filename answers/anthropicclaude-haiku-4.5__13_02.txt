## 3. Risk of Generalisation

Low-support activities like Manual_Fraud_Check can mislead analysis because:

- **Statistical unreliability**: With only 1 occurrence across 12 cases, estimates of Manual_Fraud_Check frequency, duration, or downstream outcomes lack robustness and may not reflect true process patterns.
- **Overfitting**: Predictive models may treat this activity as spurious noise rather than a genuine process variant.
- **Generalisation failure**: Conclusions drawn from this 1 case may not hold in larger datasets, leading to incorrect performance benchmarks or process redesign decisions.

A larger sample is needed to determine if Manual_Fraud_Check represents a legitimate exception-handling path or random variation.
