1️⃣ **1 occurrence** of "Manual Fraud Check" (CaseID 1002, line 10: **Manual Fraud Check,complete,2025-03-01T09:07:13Z**).  

2️⃣ This snippet shows only **3 cases** (1001–1003) and 1 manual fraud check. Analysts might misestimate frequency if these cases are atypical (e.g., higher/lower volume or different fraud-check patterns than the full month). The excerpt excludes **events outside March 1st** (e.g., early/late March) and lacks volume context (e.g., 1 in 3 cases vs. 1 in 1,000 overall). Variations in **activity naming** (e.g., "Fraud Check (Manual)" vs. "Manual Fraud Check") or **timestamp clustering** (e.g., high activity in the snippet’s window vs. sparse full-month coverage) could also skew estimates.
