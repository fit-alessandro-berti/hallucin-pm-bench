1. No  
2. In Case C002, “Pack_Items” occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment” (09:30 → 09:50 → 10:05). In Case C004, “Check_Fraud” occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment” (10:05 → 10:07 → 10:20). Thus, “Validate_Payment” does not always follow “Receive_Order” immediately.
