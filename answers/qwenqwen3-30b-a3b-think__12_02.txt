The fact is incorrect. In line 6, case C003 has "Validate_Payment" (line 6) occurring before "Receive_Order" (line 7). Additionally, case C005 (lines 11-12) has "Validate_Payment" without any preceding "Receive_Order" at all. These instances violate the claim that "Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order."
