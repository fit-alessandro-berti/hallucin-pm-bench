4. Two sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable are:
   a. **Limited Time Span:** The fragment covers only one day. A monthly frequency is based on multiple days, so a single-day sample is insufficient.
   b. **Non-Random Sampling:** The events are listed in chronological order, implying a non-random selection of events. A truly representative sample would require a random selection of events across the entire month.
