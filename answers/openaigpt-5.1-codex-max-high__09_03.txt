I cannot compute the average cycle time in hours for “Approve Invoice”, nor its standard deviation or 95 % confidence interval, because the event log provided contains only column headers without any rows or timestamp values; without start_time/complete_time pairs for “Approve Invoice” instances, no per‑activity durations can be derived, and the SLA excerpt refers to downstream lead times (Approve→Pay) rather than the execution duration of the activity itself.
