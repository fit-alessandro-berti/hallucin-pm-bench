### Answers:

**Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**  
There are **3 distinct cases**: C001, C002, and C003.  

**Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**  
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  

**Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock  

### Explanation:  
- **Q1**: The distinct case identifiers are "C001", "C002", and "C003" (observed in the `case` attribute).  
- **Q2**: For case "C002", events are ordered by timestamp:  
  - `Receive_Order` (09:15:10) → `Check_Stock` (09:22:55) → `Arrange_Delivery` (10:15:20) → `Ship_Order` (10:25:40).  
- **Q3**: The activity "Ship_Order" occurs in three cases. Its immediate predecessors are:  
  - **C001**: `Check_Stock` (before `Ship_Order` at 10:05:10).  
  - **C002**: `Arrange_Delivery` (before `Ship_Order` at 10:25:40).  
  - **C003**: `Check_Stock` (before `Ship_Order` at 10:20:30).  
  Distinct predecessors are `Arrange_Delivery` and `Check_Stock`, sorted alphabetically.
