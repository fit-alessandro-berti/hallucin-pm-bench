## Step 1: Identify distinct cases in the log fragment
To find the distinct cases, we need to look at the "case" attribute in each event. The cases mentioned are C001, C002, and C003.

## 2: Count the distinct cases
Counting the distinct cases: C001, C002, and C003. There are 3 distinct cases.

## 3: Identify the sequence of activities for case "C002"
For case "C002", the events are:
- <event case="C002" concept:name="Receive_Order" time:timestamp="2025-03-01T09:15:10"/>
- <event case="C002" concept:name="Check_Stock" time:timestamp="2025-03-01T09:22:55"/>
- <event case="C002" concept:name="Arrange_Delivery" time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:15:20"/>
- <event case="C002" concept:name="Ship_Order" time:timestamp="2025-03-01T10:25:40"/>

## 4: List the sequence of activities for case "C002"
The sequence of activities for case "C002" is: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order.

## 5: Identify distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" across all cases
To find the activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order", we examine the sequence of events for each case:
- Case C001: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order, so "Check_Stock" precedes "Ship_Order".
- Case C002: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order, so "Arrange_Delivery" precedes "Ship_Order".
- Case C003: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order, so "Check_Stock" precedes "Ship_Order".

## 6: List distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" in alphabetical order
The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

## 7: Compile the answers
- Q1: There are 3 distinct cases.
- Q2: The sequence of activities for case "C002" is Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order.
- Q3: The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
  - Arrange_Delivery
  - Check_Stock

The final answer is: 
Q1: 3
Q2: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
Q3: 
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
