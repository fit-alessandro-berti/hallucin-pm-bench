Orion Creditâ€™s process performance reveals three critical bottlenecks violating SLAs and burdened by excessive waiting times: Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment. Risk Review exceeds its 300s SLA by 780s (avg. 1080s total, 600s throughput + 480s waiting), Legal Approval exceeds its 600s SLA by 900s (avg. 1500s total, 900s throughput + 600s waiting), and Credit Assessment exceeds its 240s SLA by 260s (avg. 500s total, 300s throughput + 200s waiting). All three also exhibit the highest waiting times in the pipeline, indicating systemic delays before critical decisions.  

- Reduce Risk Review backlog by implementing automated risk scoring for low-to-medium risk cases, exempting them from manual review.  
- Streamline Legal Approval by pre-populating offer documentation using data from Draft Offer and requiring legal teams to review only deviations.  
- Split Credit Assessment into tiered lanes: automated scoring for applicants with FICO > 700, reserving manual review for high-risk cases only.
