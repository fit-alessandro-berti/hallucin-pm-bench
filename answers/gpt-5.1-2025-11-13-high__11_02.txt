The three weakest activities are Review_Documents, Request_Documents, and Initial_Assessment.  

1. **Review_Documents**  
Throughput drops to 185 cases/day (from 190 at Request_Documents and 270 upstream). It has the longest processing time (25 min), highest variability (9 min), high rework (5.3%), and the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%).  
**Action:** Introduce standardized review checklists to shorten the 25-minute average and reduce its 9-minute variability.  

2. **Request_Documents**  
This step has by far the highest wait time (150 min vs <30 elsewhere) and the highest rework rate (22%), driving the second-highest SLA breach rate (5.5%) and a throughput drop from 270 to 190 cases/day.  
**Action:** Implement claim-type–specific upfront document checklists so fewer cases trigger the current 22% rework.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
Shows elevated waiting (18 min), longer processing (12 min), higher rework (1.8%), and higher SLA breaches (3.2%) than most other tasks.  
**Action:** Reallocate staff from Register_Claim (2-minute waits, 3-minute processing) to Initial_Assessment to reduce the 18-minute queue.
