1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in the excerpt (CaseID 1002).  

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate frequency due to **limited sample size** (only 3 cases shown), **time bias** (all events on March 1, potentially atypical), or **case selection** (e.g., 1002 may be an outlier). Without full data, they cannot assess if manual checks are rare (e.g., reserved for high-risk cases) or underrepresented in this snippet. For instance, if most cases in the full log require manual checks but this excerpt includes only one such case, the analyst might underestimate prevalence. Conversely, if manual checks are rare overall, the single instance could overestimate frequency. The snippet’s narrow scope prevents distinguishing between these scenarios.
