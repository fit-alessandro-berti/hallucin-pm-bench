**1.** The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **once** in the excerpt.

**2.**  
- a) % of all events: \(1 ÷ 48 × 100 = **2.08 %**\)  
- b) % of all unique cases: \(1 ÷ 12 × 100 = **8.33 %**\)

**3.** Because Manual_Fraud_Check appears only once (≈2 % of events, ≈8 % of cases), it is a low‑support variant. If the slice is taken as representative, performance metrics (e.g., average handling time) will be skewed, and predictive models may treat it as a typical step, over‑fitting to a rare pattern. Consequently, conclusions about process efficiency or case outcomes do not generalize to the full population.
