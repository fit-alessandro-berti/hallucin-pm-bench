Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

One valid firing sequence from the initial marking is:

1. **T1**:  p0 → p1 + p2  
   - Marking: p1=1, p2=1, others 0  

2. **T2**:  p1 → p3  
   - Marking: p2=1, p3=1, p4=0  

3. **T5**:  p3 –|p4 → p6  
   - Enabled because p3=1 and p4=0  
   - Marking: p2=1, p6=1, p3=0, p4=0  

4. **T3**:  p2 → p4  
   - Marking: p4=1, p6=1  

In this run, T5 fires at step 3, while T3 fires only at step 4. Thus T5 fires *before* T3 in a reachable execution of the net.
