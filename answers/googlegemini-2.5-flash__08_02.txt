**Question 1.** In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition **T5** to fire **before** transition **T3**?
Yes.

**Question 2 (bonus).** If your answer is *yes*, give one minimal firing sequence (as an ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it; if *no*, explain why no such sequence exists.

**Sequence:** T1, T2, T7, T4, T5

**Explanation:**
To fire T5, tokens are needed in P2 and P5. T1 provides a token to P2. For P5 to be marked, T4 must fire, which in turn requires P4. P4 can be produced by either T3 or T7. If T3 fires to produce P4, the condition "T5 before T3" would be violated. Therefore, P4 must be produced by T7. For T7 to fire, it requires P3, which is produced by T2. T2 requires P1, which, like P2, is produced by T1. The sequence T1, T2, T7, T4, T5 results in P2 and P5 being simultaneously marked without T3 having fired, thus enabling T5 before T3.
