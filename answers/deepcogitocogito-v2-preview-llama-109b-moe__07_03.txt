Okay, let me start by carefully comparing the two BPMN versions provided. The task is to identify all functional changes under three specific headings: Added Tasks, Removed Tasks, and Gateway Type Changes.

First, I'll look at the tasks in both versions. In BPMN_v1, there are userTask "Receive Claim", serviceTask "Validate Coverage", userTask "Manual Review", serviceTask "Approve Claim", and serviceTask "Reject Claim". In BPMN_v2, I see the same "Receive Claim" and "Validate Coverage" tasks, but then a parallelGateway takes over where the exclusiveGateway was. After that, there are new serviceTasks: "Automated Fraud Check", "Fast-Track Approval", and "Notify Customer". The "Manual Review" task is missing in v2. So, "Task_ManualReview" is removed, and "Task_FraudCheck", "Task_FastTrackApproval", and "Task_NotifyCustomer" are added.

Next, checking the gateways. In v1, "Gateway_ReviewNeeded" and "Gateway_Payment" are both exclusive gateways. In v2, those gateways are now parallel. So both gateways changed from exclusive to parallel.

I need to make sure I'm listing only the verifiable differences and not adding any commentary. The output should strictly follow the three headings with the specified format for tasks and gateways. Let me double-check that I haven't missed any tasks or gateway changes. Yes, that seems to cover everything. Now, structuring the answer accordingly.
ADDED TASKS  
- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)  
- Task_FastTrackApproval (Fast-Track Approval)  
- Task_NotifyCustomer (Notify Customer)  

REMOVED TASKS  
- Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)  

GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES  
- Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel  
- Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel
