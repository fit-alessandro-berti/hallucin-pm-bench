Let's first restate the problem clearly:

- Initial marking:  
  \( M_0 = (p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0) \).

- Transitions:
  - \( T1: p0 \rightarrow p1 + p2 \)  (parallel split)
  - \( T2: p1 \rightarrow p3 \)
  - \( T3: p2 \rightarrow p4 \)
  - \( T4: p3 + p4 \rightarrow p5 \)  (synchronising join)
  - \( T5: p3 \rightarrow p6 \) **with inhibitor arc from \(p4\)**, i.e., \(T5\) enabled if \(p4=0\).

---

### Question:
Can \( T5 \) fire **before** \( T3 \)?

---

### Analysis:

1. **Initial marking:**  
   \( M_0 = (1,0,0,0,0,0,0) \)

2. **Fire \( T1 \)** (enabled from \( p0=1 \)):  
   Consumes 1 token from \(p0\), produces 1 token in both \(p1\) and \(p2\):

   \( M_1 = (0,1,1,0,0,0,0) \)

3. From \( M_1 \), which transitions are enabled?  
   - \( T2 \) requires token in \(p1\) (has 1 token)  
   - \( T3 \) requires token in \(p2\) (has 1 token)  
   - \( T5 \) requires token in \(p3\) and \(p4=0\)  
     - But currently \( p3=0 \), so \( T5 \) **not** enabled  
   - \( T4 \) requires tokens in both \(p3\) and \(p4\), not enabled because both are 0

4. **Check if \( T5 \) can fire before \( T3 \).**  
   To fire \( T5 \):  
   - Need a token in \(p3\)  
   - \(p4\) must be empty (0 tokens).  
   Currently, \( p3=0 \), so \( T5 \) cannot fire immediately.

5. To get tokens in \( p3 \), must fire \( T2 \):  
   \( T2: p1 \rightarrow p3 \), consuming token in \(p1\), producing token in \(p3\).

6. **If \( T3 \) fires before \( T5 \), then \(p4\) will contain a token \( (p4=1) \), disabling \( T5 \) due to the inhibitor arc.**

7. **Is it possible for \( T5 \) to fire before \( T3 \) after \( T2 \) fires?**

   Fire \( T2 \):  
   \( M_2 = (0,0,1,1,0,0,0) \)

   Now, tokens are \(p2=1\), \(p3=1\), \(p4=0\).

   Conditions for \( T5 \) (enabled if \(p3 \ge 1\) and \( p4 = 0\)):

   - \(p3=1\) ⇒ consumable
   - \(p4=0\) ⇒ inhibitor satisfied

   So \( T5 \) **is enabled at \(M_2\)**.

8. Before \( T3 \) fires, at \( M_2 \), we can fire \( T5 \).

---

### Concrete firing sequence where \( T5 \) fires before \( T3 \):

- \( M_0 = (1,0,0,0,0,0,0) \)
- Fire \( T1 \):
  
  \( M_1 = (0,1,1,0,0,0,0) \)
  
- Fire \( T2 \):

  \( M_2 = (0,0,1,1,0,0,0) \)
  
- Fire \( T5 \):

  \( M_3 = (0,0,1,0,0,0,1) \)  
  (token moved from \(p3\) to \(p6\))

- \( T3 \) has **not** fired yet.

---

### Conclusion:

**Yes**, \( T5 \) **can** fire before \( T3 \).

---

### Brief justification:

- \( T5 \) requires tokens in \( p3 \) and zero tokens in \( p4 \).
- \( p3 \) gets tokens only after firing \( T2 \).
- Firing \( T1 \), then \( T2 \) places tokens in \( p2 \) and \( p3 \), with \( p4=0 \).
- Thus \( T5 \) can fire immediately after \( T2 \) but before \( T3 \).
- Firing \( T5 \) consumes \(p3\) and produces \(p6\), without interfering with tokens in \(p2\) (so \(T3\) can still fire later).
