1️⃣ **Actual string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs exactly 1 time** (row 6). Note: "Fraud Check (Automatic)" (row 7) and earlier "Automatic Fraud Check" (row 2) are distinct activities.

2️⃣ Analysts risk underestimating manual fraud checks from this snippet alone because:
- It lacks **full context** (3/3 cases shown, but March's data could include higher volumes of Manual Fraud Checks)
- **Small sample size** distorts patterns (e.g., 1/3 cases here are CaseID 1002—solo subjects inflate perceived uniqueness)

**Key insight**: Snippets buts sample bias. Full log data needed for true incidence rates. (99 words)

*( organismes analytically—the string "Manual Fraud Check" is *unique* to row 6 only. Other fraud-check variants are excluded.)*
