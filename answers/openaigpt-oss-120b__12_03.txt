**Answer:** No  

**Justification:**  

- **Case C001:** `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment` (Validate_Payment follows immediately).  
- **Case C002:** `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment` (Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment).  
- **Case C003:** `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment` (immediate, but this single case does not prove the rule for all cases).  
- **Case C004:** `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment` (Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment).  

Since in Cases **C002** and **C004** the activity **Validate_Payment** does **not** occur directly after **Receive_Order**, the statement that it *always* occurs immediately after is false.
