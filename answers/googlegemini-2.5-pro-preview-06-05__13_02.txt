Based on the data supplied:

1.  The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time.
2.  The percentage of:
    a) all events that include this activity is **2.08%** (1 of 48 events).
    b) all unique cases that include this activity is **8.33%** (1 of 12 cases).
3.  This low-support activity appears in only one case, making it an infrequent variant. Generalizing from a single instance is unreliable. Performance metrics, like average case duration, would be skewed by this one path. For example, case C05 is faster than many cases that follow the main path. A predictive model trained on this limited data might learn spurious correlations, such as incorrectly associating this manual step with faster approvals, leading to poor predictions when applied to the process at scale.
