1.  The activity "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" occurs **1** time in the excerpt.

2.  
    a) The activity "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" occurs in 1/48 = **2.08%** of all events.
    b) The activity "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" occurs in 1/12 = **8.33%** of all unique cases.

3.  The low support of "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" (one occurrence) makes generalisations risky. It suggests the activity is rare. If we build a model, this activity's impact will be minimal on performance metrics. Thus on this log subset, it will likely be an insignificant predictor of outcomes (approve/reject). If the complete dataset indicates many instances of "Manual\_Fraud\_Check," any conclusions on its rarity or insignificance from this snapshot would be misleading. The findings are not generalizable.
