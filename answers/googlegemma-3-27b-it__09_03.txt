It is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity based on the provided information. Artefact A, the event log, has had all row data and timestamps redacted. While the header indicates the presence of 'start_time' and 'complete_time' columns which *would* be necessary to calculate durations for each instance of "Approve Invoice", these values are missing. Without the actual timestamps, any computation is not possible. Artefact B provides information about overall payment times and a historical average, but not the data needed to analyse the "Approve Invoice" activity specifically.
