**Executive Memo: Claims Process Performance – Q1 2025**  

The three worst-performing activities, based on highest rework rate and SLA breach, are:  

1. **Request Documents**: High rework (22.0%) and SLA breach (5.5%) stem from excessive average wait time (150 min), indicating upstream bottlenecks delaying initiation despite low processing time variability (stdev = 1 min). *Recommendation*: Redesign document request triggers to reduce queue buildup—e.g., auto-send requests at claim registration if coverage criteria are met, cutting wait time and repeat cases.  

2. **Review Documents**: Elevated rework (5.3%) and SLA breach (12.4%) correlate with high processing variability (stdev = 9 min), suggesting inconsistent review quality or scope creep during execution after a 30-min average wait. *Recommendation*: Standardize review checklists and automate data validation to reduce variation—target lowering stdev by ≥3 min to cut rework and breaches.  

3. **Initial Assessment**: Highest SLA breach among core steps (3.2%), driven by long processing time relative to throughput—high avg processing time (12 min) vs low throughput slack suggests capacity strain or inefficiency after an 18-min average queue delay. *Recommendation*: Reallocate staff from low-wait activities or introduce pre-assessment triage automation to reduce initial assessment load by 10%.
