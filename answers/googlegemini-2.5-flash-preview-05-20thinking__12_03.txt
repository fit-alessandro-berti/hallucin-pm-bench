No.

**Justification:**

The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" always occurs *immediately after* "Receive_Order", with no other activities in between. This is disproven by the following cases:

*   **Case C002:** After "Receive_Order" (09:30:00), "Pack_Items" (09:50:00) occurs *before* "Validate_Payment" (10:05:00).
*   **Case C004:** After "Receive_Order" (10:05:00), "Check_Fraud" (10:07:00) occurs *before* "Validate_Payment" (10:20:00).
