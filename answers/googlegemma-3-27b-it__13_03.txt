1. The activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs 1 time in this excerpt.

2. This excerpt represents a very limited timeframe – just a few hours on a single day. It’s highly probable this is not representative of the entire month of March 2025. The observed frequency of "Manual Fraud Check" (once) could be misleading. If the excerpt happens to fall during a period of unusually *low* manual check activity (e.g., a weekend, or a system update), the full log might reveal significantly more occurrences. Conversely, it could be a peak in manual checks. Therefore, extrapolating from this snippet alone would yield an inaccurate estimation.
