**Answer:** No

**Justification:**
The FACT claims that **"Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between."** However, the event log provides counterexamples:

1. **Case C002** shows the sequence:
   - *Receive_Order* (09:30:00)
   - **Pack_Items** (09:50:00) ← **intervening activity**
   - *Validate_Payment* (10:05:00)

2. **Case C004** shows the sequence:
   - *Receive_Order* (10:05:00)
   - **Check_Fraud** (10:07:00) ← **intervening activity**
   - *Validate_Payment* (10:20:00)

These cases violate the FACT’s "always" condition. Only **C001** and **C003** follow the claimed pattern. Thus, the FACT is **inaccurate**.
