**No**

The fact is inaccurate because line 6 shows case C003 executing *Validate_Payment* at 2025-02-01T10:43:00Z, followed by *Receive_Order* at 2025-02-01T10:45:00Z in line 7, meaning *Validate_Payment* precedes rather than follows *Receive_Order* for that case. While other instances of *Validate_Payment* (lines 2,5,9,11) do follow *Receive_Order* in their respective cases (C001 lines 1-2; C002 lines 3-5; C004 lines 8-9; C005 line 11 before unrelated cancel), the C003 sequence violates the "always" claim.
