**MEMORANDUM**

To: Orion Credit COO
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst
Subject: Top Three Underperforming Activities Requiring Immediate Action

The data reveals three activities where SLA breaches and excessive waiting times are most severe:

- **Legal Approval** exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds (50%) and has the highest average waiting time (600 seconds).
- **Risk Review** exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds (100%) with an average waiting time of 480 seconds.
- **Credit Assessment** exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds (25%) and has a waiting time of 200 seconds.

These delays risk customer dissatisfaction and operational inefficiency.

**Recommendations:**
- **Legal Approval:** Implement a triage system to prioritize cases based on complexity, reducing waiting time by reallocating resources to high-volume, low-complexity cases first.
- **Risk Review:** Introduce parallel processing for low-risk cases (e.g., automated pre-screening) to cut throughput time by 30%, aligning with the SLA.
- **Credit Assessment:** Deploy a rule-based decision engine for standard applications, reducing manual review time by 20% and lowering waiting time.
