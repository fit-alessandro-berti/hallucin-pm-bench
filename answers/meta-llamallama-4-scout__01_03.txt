## Step 1: Identify the decision points in Acme's loan-approval process
The decision points are steps where a condition or a set of approvals determines the next course of action. These are: 
- The Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome which determines the risk rating (Low, Medium, High).
- The conditional branch after step 4: *If* (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} **AND** requested-amount ≤ €250 000), which decides whether to skip step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review).
- The Decision-Gate **“TriVote”** in step 6, which requires approvals from all three: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer, with a decision rule that *any two approvals out of three suffice to pass*.

## 2: Describe each decision point's rule in one sentence
- The Tri-Color-Risk-Check decision point assesses the risk rating as Low, Medium, or High based on inputs from Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow.
- The conditional branch decision point skips Manual-Underwriting-Review if the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is ≤ €250,000.
- The Decision-Gate **“TriVote”** decision point passes if any two out of the three required officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve.

## 3: List all documents required in the process in the order they first appear
The documents required are:
1. **Form 14B** (Receive-Application)
2. **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) - These are inputs, not traditionally considered "documents" in the same vein as the others but are crucial for the process.
3. **Deck Memo** (Manual-Underwriting-Review)
4. **Offer Sheet 77** (Prepare-Binding-Offer)
5. **ID Matrix Declaration** (Request-Applicant-Confirmation)
6. **Loan Dossier 2025** (Finalize-Agreement)

## 4: Compile the answers for part a and part b
**a) Decision points with rules:**
1. The Tri-Color-Risk-Check assesses the risk rating as Low, Medium, or High.
2. The process skips Manual-Underwriting-Review if the risk is Low or Medium and the requested amount is ≤ €250,000.
3. The **“TriVote”** gate passes if any two out of three required officers approve.

**b) List of documents in order of appearance:**
1. **Form 14B**
2. **Deck Memo**
3. **Offer Sheet 77**
4. **ID Matrix Declaration**
5. **Loan Dossier 2025**

And noting **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** as critical process inputs.

The final answer is: 
## For a) Summarise every *decision point*:
1. The Tri-Color-Risk-Check decision point assesses the risk rating as Low, Medium, or High based on Scorecard inputs.
2. The process skips Manual-Underwriting-Review if risk ∈ {Low, Medium} and requested-amount ≤ €250,000.
3. The Decision-Gate **“TriVote”** passes if any two out of three required officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve.

## For b) List of documents:
1. **Form 14B**
2. **Deck Memo**
3. **Offer Sheet 77**
4. **ID Matrix Declaration**
5. **Loan Dossier 2025**
