The user instruction:

"Summarise the **decision points** in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process and list **every required document**. Use exactly the activity names given; do **not** introduce standard loan terminology."

The system description gives the process below:

Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process, structure is as following:

1. Receive Micro-loan Application (RMA)
2. Quick KYC Verification (KYC)
3. Community Impact Assessment (CIA)
4. Dual Underwriter Split:
   4a. Senior Underwriter A
   4b. Senior Underwriter B
5. Underwriter Alignment Gate:
   - If two scores differ by ≤2 points, continue.
   - Else, escalate to harmonisation committee.
6. Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)
7. Amount Threshold Decision:
   - If amount < €15 000 then auto-approve.
   - If amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to step 8.
8. Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)
9. Disburse Funds

Now the question is "Summarise the decision points in Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track process and list every required document." But it says: "Use exactly the activity names given" in our summary.

I need to check all required documents at submission time:
- Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01) (Yes)
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
- Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
- Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
- Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
- Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)

Thus document set is exactly six items.

Now what is exactly decision points: "decision points" indicate steps where a specific decision must be taken (branching decisions). I'm going through the process and extract decision points, listing:

We have more than one steps that incorporate decision points.

I'll structure answer as text, but I have to exactly refer to "activity names." That means I'll use the exactly given names: "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" is not a decision point? Actually, "Neighbourhood feedback check (NFC)" doesn't contain a decision itself, it collects evidence - probably not a decision point. But let's check the process steps in detail:

The question instructs us: "Summarise the decision points" i.e. states that at certain steps, decisions are taken. Which steps specifically are decision points? They are defined as points where a branch decision is made:

- Underwriter Alignment Gate (UA): That step is a gate that either continues process if risk scores differ by ≤2 OR escalate if difference is more than 2. That is a decision point (point 5).
- Amount Threshold Decision is another decision point (point 7): after collecting evidence from the NFC. It says: "If amount < €15,000 then auto-approve. Else, if amount >= €15,000 then proceed to step 8." So the step "Amount Threshold Decision" is a decision point.
- Also, the dual underwriter application's exactly these two risk scores. But that's not a decision point by itself because it's the combination of risk plus a decision gate? But it says "if difference ≤2, then continue, else escalate." So I need to include "Underwriter Alignment Gate" as decision logic.

- The Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) might be referred as a decision. But MBA is not a decision point: it's a step but it's not called a decision point in the process summary provided by the question. But the question is "decision points" like after evaluating risk and amount threshold, decision is taken to either auto-approve or escalate decision to the board. Let me see if the MBA step "Final Micro-loan Board Approval" is exactly a decision taken. But I think the equivalent is: The actual decision is done at Underwriter Alignment Gate. But MBA is a step in which a vote is taken by the board (approve or reject). That's also a decision point. But the instructions said: "list every required document" exactly. So I should list them: "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01), Proof of Address, Latest Income Statement, Community Impact Statement (CIS) template, Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet, and Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)". We must list them exactly as given. So include exactly these names.

I need to include "decision points in Acme Micro-loan Fast-Track process" summarize them using given names.

Now I need to quickly check instructions: "Summarise the decision points ... Use exactly the activity names given. Do not introduce standard loan terminology."
So I should not include defaults "auto-approve", "board approval" etc. But we can use the given ones.

The steps available in the process with decision points:
Step 1: Receive Micro-loan Application (RMA) starts the process. Not a decision point.
Step 2: Quick KYC Verification (KYC) is a check, not a decision point. It is "skip all credit history checks".
Step 3: Community Impact Assessment (CIA) is an assessment; it's not a decision point.
Step 4: Dual Underwriter Split: In step 4 the process branches into two underwriters. But a decision is not being taken exactly here? It's the fact they evaluate risk. There is no explicit decision point because they are "assigning risk scores".
Step 5: Underwriter Alignment Gate: "If the two scores differ by ≤ 2, continue to step 6. Else, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision, then continue." So decision point is: Use the two risk scores computed by Senior Underwriter A and Senior Underwriter B at this point. The decision is based on the difference in risk scores. That is a primary decision point.
Step 6: Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC) gathers at least 3 local references. That isn't exactly a decision point, but it's a Check which is either satisfied or not.
Step 7: Amount Threshold Decision:
   "If amount < €15 000, auto approves without further escalation; if amount ≥ €15 000 then proceed to step 8." So that's a decision point.
Step 8: Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA): Board votes, so it is a decision point where the "board approves or rejects". 
Step 9: Disburse Funds is not a decision point but a step. It's a final step.

Thus the key decision points we can highlight are:
- Underwriter Alignment Gate: Determines if the risk scores difference is ≤2 so that processing can continue, or if it's more than 2 then escalate to the Harmonisation Committee.
- Amount Threshold Decision: Evaluation of loan amount to decide if auto-approval is applicable, or if to proceed with further approval.
- Final Micro-loan Board Approval: They vote and decide to approve or reject the loan.

Now, however, the instructions says: "Summarise the decision points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process". So what exactly are the decision points? The process steps that include "decision" is the Underwriter Alignment Gate and the Amount Threshold Decision. The MBA step is also decision point. But note: "Underwriter Alignment Gate" includes the possibility of escalating the decision to the Harmonisation Committee, which is also a tie-break decision point on risk score alignment differences. So I must mention that clearly.

However, the question asked "list every required document", so I'll produce them in bullet list:
- Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
- Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
- Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
- Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
- Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)

I must use exactly the provided names: "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)", "Proof of Address" etc. So I'll list them exactly in that order.

I must "use exactly the activity names given", so that means I should refer to process steps exactly: "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Dual Underwriter Split", "Neighbourhood Feedback Check", "Amount Threshold Decision", "Final Micro-loan Board Approval".

I should say decisions happen at "Underwriter Alignment Gate" point and "Amount Threshold Decision" point and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval" step.

But one thing, the process text states in step 4: "Dual Underwriter Split" which includes both Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B. But there isn't a decision that is taken there. I'll only mention "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision", and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval." But I'm not sure if "Dual Underwriter Split" qualifies as a decision point? Not exactly because it is the process where risk is calculated.

I can mention the "Harmonisation Committee" decision step if the scores difference is more than 2. But instructions "list every required document" means at submission time there are required documents provided in listing. I must produce exactly: the following:
- Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
- Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
- Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
- Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
- Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)

I must not use any standard loan terminology introduced. So I must not include "credit check", "loan evaluation", "application review" etc. I must use process names exactly.

I should be careful: "use exactly the activity names given" means that if I say "community impact assessment", it must be referred to as "Community Impact Assessment" with proper first letter being capital. Similarly, "Micro-loan Board Approval" must be referred exactly to match provided structure.

Thus I'll produce an output that's something like:

The Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process has several decision points:
1) Underwriter Alignment Gate: At this step, the evaluation of risk scores by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B is compared. If the scores differ by ≤2 points, processing continues, but if they differ by more than 2, the decision is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee for tie-break resolution.
2) Amount Threshold Decision: At this decision point, the loan amount is evaluated. If the amount is less than €15,000, it is auto-approved, otherwise if is it ≥€15,000 it moves on to the Final Micro-loan Board Approval step.
3) Final Micro-loan Board Approval: In this stage, the micro-loan board votes to either approve or reject the application.

I now produce the final answer.

I must produce a formatted answer that lists decision points and required documents. I must not use Markdown formatting. I must produce plain text answer.

However note: The question states "Summarize the decision points" but "list every required document" after summarizing. I can lead by listing decisions and then a separate section for required documents. There is no requirement to rephrase, but exactly list could be something like "Documents Required:" bullet list list exactly those six items.

I check "Use exactly the activity names given". So I must incorporate the word "Dual Underwriter Split" maybe. But it's not a decision point. But in the instructions, "exactly the activity names given" means the process decision points, steps I mention specifically as names "Underwriter Alignment Gate", which is in the process steps I will mention.

Double-check the process names: They include "Receive Micro-loan Application (RMA)", "Quick KYC Verification (KYC)", "Community Impact Assessment (CIA)", "Dual Underwriter Split" (which includes Senior Underwriter A and Senior Underwriter B), "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)", "Amount Threshold Decision", "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)", "Disburse Funds". So potential decision points might be "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision", "Final Micro-loan Board Approval".

The question explicitly says "Summarize the decision points", so only refer to steps where a decision is being made? It doesn't seem I'm allowed to mention "Dual Underwriter Split" because it is evidently not a decision point because it's a splitting process. But the "Dual Underwriter Split" is for risk rating by assigning risk scores. But there is no decision taken by that step (except a branching decision if risk scores differ, but that is post risk score alignment gate). So in summary I produce exactly the branch decisions: "Underwriter Alignment Gate" and "Amount Threshold Decision" and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval". But also mention that if misalignment registers, additional decision point: "Harmonisation Committee."

But the instruction "without standard loan terminology" means using terms like "credit check" etc must not be used. Not sure if I'll mention "Harmonisation Committee" which is included in text precisely.

So I'll produce a summarizing text that uses the process names given. For example:

"In the Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process, decision points occur at the Underwriter Alignment Gate, the Amount Threshold Decision, and the Final Micro-loan Board Approval. At the Underwriter Alignment Gate, if the risk scores assigned by Senior Underwriter A and Senior Underwriter B differ by more than 2 points, the decision is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee, effectively making the decision during this step. The Amount Threshold Decision evaluates whether the requested loan amount is less than or equal to €15,000, in which case the loan is auto-approved. For loan amounts at or exceeding €15,000, the decision proceeds to the Final Micro-loan Board Approval, where the board votes on the application."

Then I'll list the required documents:
"Required documents at submission time include:
- Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
- Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
- Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
- Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
- Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)"

I must check the order of items. The provided order in the process text is:
- Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
- Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
- Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
- Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
- Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)

Yes, I'll produce a bullet list.

I must follow exact terminology and not modifying them. I must check that "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet" is exactly as given "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet"? The original document listed has "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet" but I'm not 100% sure if it's hyphenated? Check list "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet." Yes.

I'll now produce answer as plain text.

It says "You are an expert on Acme Bank's Micro-loan Fast-Track process" so I must produce answer as conversation answer. I'll produce answer as final message text following instructions.

I'll now produce conclusion answer.Below is a summary of the decision points and the complete list of required documents exactly as defined:

Decision Points:
• Underwriter Alignment Gate – At this step the risk scores given by Senior Underwriter A and Senior Underwriter B are compared. If the scores differ by more than 2 points, the decision is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee; otherwise, processing continues.
• Amount Threshold Decision – Here the system evaluates the requested amount. If the amount is less than €15,000 the process auto‐approves; if it is €15,000 or more, the decision proceeds further.
• Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) – At this stage the board votes to approve or reject the application.

Required Documents (at submission time):
• Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
• Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
• Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
• Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
• Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
• Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)
