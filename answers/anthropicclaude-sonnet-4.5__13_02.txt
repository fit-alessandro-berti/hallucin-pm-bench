## 1. Occurrence Count
**"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt (case C05 only).

## 2. Percentages

**a) Percentage of all events:**
- Total events: 48
- Manual_Fraud_Check events: 1
- **Percentage: 2.08%** (1/48 × 100)

**b) Percentage of all unique cases:**
- Total cases: 12
- Cases with Manual_Fraud_Check: 1 (C05)
- **Percentage: 8.33%** (1/12 × 100)

## 3. Risk of Generalizing from Low-Support Activities

A single occurrence (8.33% case coverage) provides insufficient statistical evidence to understand when Manual_Fraud_Check is triggered, how long it takes, or its impact on outcomes. Performance metrics (throughput time, bottlenecks) and predictive models trained on this slice would underweight this path, potentially missing critical fraud-handling scenarios. The excerpt may capture an exceptional period or unrepresentative sample where manual checks were rare, leading to inaccurate process maps and unreliable predictions when deployed on broader data where manual reviews might be more frequent.
