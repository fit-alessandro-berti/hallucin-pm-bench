In the log fragment, *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order*. For case C003 (lines 6–7), *Validate_Payment* occurs **before** *Receive_Order*, violating the claimed sequence. Additionally, case C005 (lines 11–12) shows *Validate_Payment* followed by *Cancel_Order* without any preceding *Receive_Order* in the provided log.
