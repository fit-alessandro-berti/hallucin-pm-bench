1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** in this fragment.

2. This represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1 out of 18 total events, rounded to two decimal places).

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is: **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:
   - **Small sample size**: Only 18 events are logged, which is insufficient to generalize monthly trends.
   - **Temporal bias**: The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01), and fraud check frequency may vary across days/weeks.
