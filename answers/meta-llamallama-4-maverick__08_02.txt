## Step 1: Understand the given Petri net PN-8 and its initial marking M0 = {P0}.
The Petri net PN-8 has places P0 to P6 and transitions T1 to T7 with specific input and output places. Initially, P0 has 1 token.

## Step 2: Analyze the firing sequence and the conditions for T5 to fire before T3.
T5 requires P2 and P5 to be marked. P2 is marked after T1 fires, and P5 is marked after T4 fires, which in turn requires P4 to be marked. P4 can be marked by either T3 (after T2 and T7) or directly by T3 if P2 is directly used, but T3 depends on P2.

## Step 3: Examine the condition for T5 to fire before T3.
For T5 to fire before T3, P2 and P5 must be marked before T3 fires. P2 is marked after T1. T3 can only fire after P2 is marked, so we need to check the sequence that leads to P5 being marked before T3.

## Step 4: Assess the possibility of T5 firing before T3.
After T1 fires, P1 and P2 are marked. T2 and T3 can fire subsequently. For T5 to fire before T3, we must consider the path: T1 -> T2 -> T7 -> T4 (enabling P5) and then check if T5 can fire before T3.

## Step 5: Determine the feasibility and provide a firing sequence if possible.
T1 fires, marking P1 and P2. Then, T2 and T7 can fire, marking P3 and then P4 (through T7), and subsequently T4 can fire, marking P5. Now, T5 can fire if P2 is still marked, which it is. So, one possible sequence is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. Here, T3 hasn't fired yet, and T5 can fire because P2 and P5 are marked.

## Step 6: Provide the answer to Question 1 and a sequence for Question 2 if applicable.
For Question 1, yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3. A minimal firing sequence demonstrating this is T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

The final answer is: $\boxed{Yes}$
