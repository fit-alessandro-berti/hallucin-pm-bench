**Yes**, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

Shortest firing sequence: T1, T2b, T4, T5

### Explanation
Starting from the initial marking (p0=1), the sequence T1, T2b, T4, T5 reaches a marking where T5 fires (marking after T4: pa=0, pb=0, pc=0, pd=1, pe=1; T5 consumes pd and pe to produce pf=1). At this point, T3 has not fired because pc=0, so no token has ever entered the "normal path" through T2 â†’ T3. Thus, T5 fires before T3. This sequence has length 4, which is minimal because T5 requires tokens in both pd and pe, necessitating at least these four firings to produce them.
