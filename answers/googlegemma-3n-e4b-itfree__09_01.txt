1) I can calculate the average cycle time of the "Review Contract" activity.

2) The "Review Contract" activity occurred 4 times in the log. The durations were not provided in the log data. Therefore, I cannot calculate the average cycle time. However, if the durations were available, the calculation would involve summing the durations of all instances of "Review Contract" and then dividing by the number of instances (4 in this case).
