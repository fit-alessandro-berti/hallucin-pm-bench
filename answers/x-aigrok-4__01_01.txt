### Decision Points in Contoso’s Process
The process includes the following decision points, where outcomes determine progression (e.g., approval, branching, or continuation). These are summarized based on the defined steps and constraints:

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: The triage agent decides eligibility by checking the claim against the FlightManifest and WeatherReport. This validation must succeed for the process to continue.

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: The finance controller decides to sign off on the claim using the EligibilityChecklist. This pre-approval must succeed before Process_Refund_Payment can begin.

3. **High-value branch decision**: After pre-approval, a decision is made based on whether the refund amount exceeds €1,000. If it does, the process branches to Senior_Auditor_Review; otherwise, it proceeds directly toward Process_Refund_Payment.

4. **Senior_Auditor_Review** (applies only to high-value claims): The senior auditor decides on the claim by reviewing the AuditTrail. This review must be completed before Process_Refund_Payment can begin for high-value claims.
