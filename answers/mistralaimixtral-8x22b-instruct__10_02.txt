**Key:**
- **R** = Responsible (executes the task)
- **A** = Accountable (ultimately answerable for success)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)
- **I** = Informed (notified of outcome)
```

### Notes:
1. **"Transaction Analyst"** replaces "payment clerk" (per mandate).
2. **"Regulatory Liaison"** replaces "compliance officer" (per mandate).
3. **"KYC Review"** replaces "customer due diligence" (per mandate).
4. **IT Support** is included as a role for technical tasks (no mandated term provided).
5. **Accountability (A)** is assigned to the **Regulatory Liaison** for approvals and notifications, while **IT Support** is accountable for archiving.
