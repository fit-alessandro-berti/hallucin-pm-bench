1) The average cycle time of "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the provided data. The log only lists activities and resources, but *not* the duration of each activity.

2) To calculate the average cycle time, we would need timestamps associated with each activity, allowing us to determine the elapsed time (duration) between the start and end of the "Review Contract" activity for each case. Without those timestamps, no cycle time calculation is possible.
