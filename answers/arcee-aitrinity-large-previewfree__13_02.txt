1. **1 occurrence**  
2. a) **2.08%** of all events (1 / 48 × 100)  
   b) **8.33%** of all cases (1 / 12 × 100)  
3. An activity appearing in only one case (8.33% of cases, 2.08% of events) is too sparse to yield reliable statistical patterns. It may create outliers in performance metrics, bias predictive models toward rare paths, and produce misleading benchmarks if assumed representative of normal process behaviour.
