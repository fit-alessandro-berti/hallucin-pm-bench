**1️⃣ Occurrences of the exact string:**
The exact activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **1** time in this excerpt (CaseID 1002 at 09:07:13Z).

**2️⃣ Why an analyst might misestimate (≤ 120 words):**
An analyst might misestimate the full month's frequency based on this snippet for two strictly data-driven reasons:

1. **Inadequate Timeframe:** The data spans barely two hours (09:02Z to 10:45Z) on a single day (March 1st) and contains only three cases. Extrapolating this tiny sliver to an entire month's volume is statistically unreliable. 
2. **Nomenclature Inconsistencies:** The data demonstrates a lack of standardization in activity naming. Case 1001 logs *"Automatic Fraud Check"*, while Case 1003 explicitly logs *"Fraud Check (Automatic)"*. Given this proven inconsistency, the full month's log likely contains unstandardized variations of manual checks (e.g., *"Fraud Check (Manual)"*) that would be completely missed if estimating based solely on the exact string "Manual Fraud Check."
