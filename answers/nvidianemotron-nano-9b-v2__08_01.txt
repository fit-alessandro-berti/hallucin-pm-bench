Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3. 

**Firing sequence:**  
1. **T1** fires: p0 → p1 + p2 (marking: p1(1), p2(1)).  
2. **T2** fires: p1 → p3 (marking: p3(1), p2(1)).  
3. **T5** fires: p3 → p6 (marking: p3(0), p6(1)).  

**Justification:**  
After T1, p1 and p2 are enabled. Firing T2 first populates p3 with 1 token while p4 remains 0. Since T5 requires p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0, it is enabled immediately after T2. Thus, T5 can fire before T3.
