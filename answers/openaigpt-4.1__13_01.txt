4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**

- The sample size is very small (only 18 events and 4 cases), increasing susceptibility to random variation and sampling bias.
