**Critical Findings**

Our 12-month analysis reveals three activities driving excessive claim delays:

**#1 Request_Documents**  
Average wait: 36.5 h | 95th percentile: 120.0 h  
*Action:* Deploy automated SMS/email reminders at 24 h and 48 h post-request; pilot chatbot to guide document upload in real time.

**#2 Send_Closure_Letter**  
Average wait: 12.2 h | 95th percentile: 44.0 h  
*Action:* Automate letter generation and dispatch via workflow rules triggered immediately upon claim closure approval.

**#3 Assess_Liability**  
Average wait: 7.8 h | 95th percentile: 16.4 h  
*Action:* Introduce priority-queue logic allocating adjusters by claim complexity; reallocate 15 % of Assess_Liability capacity from low-complexity files.

Each intervention targets ≥20 % wait-time reduction within 90 days.
