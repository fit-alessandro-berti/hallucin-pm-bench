Let me analyze this step by step:

1) From initial marking (p0=1), T1 must fire first (it's the only enabled transition)
   - After T1: pa=1, pb=1

2) From here, we have three transitions that could fire:
   - T2 (needs pa)
   - T2b (needs pa)
   - T4 (needs pb)

3) For T5 to fire, we need BOTH:
   - pd (which comes from either T2b directly or T3 after T2)
   - pe (which can only come from T4)

4) For T5 to fire before T3, we need:
   - T2b must be chosen (not T2) to get pd without using T3
   - T4 must fire to get pe

Therefore, YES, it is possible. Here's the shortest firing sequence:

T1, T2b, T4, T5

This sequence:
1. T1 puts tokens in pa and pb
2. T2b takes from pa and puts in pd
3. T4 takes from pb and puts in pe
4. T5 can now fire (having both pd and pe) before T3 ever fires
