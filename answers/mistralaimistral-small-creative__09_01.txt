1) **The average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the provided data.**
   - The log does not include timestamps or elapsed-time fields for any activity, including "Review Contract." Only case IDs, activity names, and resource assignments are visible.

2) **Explanation of the limitation:**
   - Cycle time is calculated as the duration between the start and end of an activity (or the time between consecutive activities in a process). Without timestamps or elapsed-time values, we cannot compute the time taken for "Review Contract" or any other activity in the log.
   - The historical benchmark (FY-2023) provides averages for other activities but does not apply to this log or the "Review Contract" activity specifically. Benchmarks are not interchangeable with actual log data.
