It is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the activity “Approve Invoice” because the event log (Artefact A) has been fully redacted—all rows and timestamp values have been removed. Although the log structure (column names) is provided, there is no actual data on start_time or complete_time for any instance of “Approve Invoice.” Without these timestamps, cycle time (defined as the difference between completion and start times for an activity) cannot be calculated for even a single case, let alone aggregated into statistics. The SLA excerpt (Artefact B) offers contextual benchmarks but no empirical measurements from the log itself.
