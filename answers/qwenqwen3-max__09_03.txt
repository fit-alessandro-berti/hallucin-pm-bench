Cannot compute average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for “Approve Invoice”.  
Artefact A contains only column headers; all event rows and timestamp values are redacted. Cycle time requires difference between start_time and complete_time for each instance of the activity. Without actual timestamps or durations, no statistical calculation is possible. Artefact B provides historical KPIs but no raw event data to compute new metrics.
