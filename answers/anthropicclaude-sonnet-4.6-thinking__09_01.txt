## Answer

**The average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be calculated from the data provided.**

---

### Explanation

The event log explicitly states:

> *"timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been **redacted**"*

The only fields present in the log are:

| Field | Available? |
|---|---|
| `case_id` | ✅ |
| `activity` | ✅ |
| `resource` | ✅ |
| `timestamp` / `elapsed time` | ❌ Redacted |

To compute a cycle time (or duration) for any activity, at minimum **two timestamps per activity instance** are required (a start and a end/completion event), or a pre-computed elapsed-time field. Neither is present here.

### Why the benchmark cannot substitute

The historical benchmark (FY-2023) provides averages for *"Receive Renewal Request," "Negotiate Terms,"* and *"Legal Sign-off"* — but:

1. **"Review Contract" is not listed** in the benchmark at all.
2. Even if it were, the benchmark explicitly pertains to a **different customer segment** and therefore cannot be reliably applied to this log.

**Conclusion:** To answer this question, the full event log — including start/end timestamps or pre-computed durations — must be restored or provided.
