**EXECUTIVE MEMO**

**To:** Chief Operating Officer, Orion Credit
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Re:** Critical Process Bottlenecks Requiring Immediate Attention

---

Analysis of our loan origination process reveals three activities significantly breaching SLA targets while exhibiting excessive waiting times:

**Legal Approval** exceeds its 600s SLA by 300s (50% over target) with 600s average waiting time—the highest in our process. **Risk Review** surpasses its 300s SLA by 300s (100% over target) with 480s waiting time, and only 480 of 1,175 assessed cases proceed to this stage. **Credit Assessment** breaches its 240s SLA by 60s (25% over target) with 200s average waiting time across 1,175 cases.

**Recommendations:**

• **Legal Approval:** Implement parallel legal review workflows to reduce the 600s waiting time bottleneck
• **Risk Review:** Add dedicated risk analysts to address the 480s waiting time causing 100% SLA breach
• **Credit Assessment:** Automate preliminary credit scoring to eliminate 200s of idle waiting time

Immediate intervention on these three activities will materially improve end-to-end cycle time.
