**To: COO, Acme Insurance — Claims Handling (Q1-2025) Performance Hotspots**

1) **Request_Documents** – Worst overall delay and capacity drag: lowest throughput among upstream steps (190/day) and by far the highest **wait time** (150 min). It also shows extreme **rework** (22.0%) and elevated **SLA breaches** (5.5%).  
**Action:** Reduce rework by tightening the document request package (standard checklist + mandatory fields) and track impact: target rework from **22% → <10%**, which should also cut the 150-min queue.

2) **Review_Documents** – Highest execution burden and risk: **processing time** is the highest (25 min) with high **variability** (stdev 9) and the highest **SLA breach** rate (12.4%). Throughput is also low (185/day).  
**Action:** Introduce triage/standardization (e.g., route “complete/low-complexity” files to a fast lane) to reduce variability; target stdev **9 → <5** and SLA breaches **12.4% → <6%**.

3) **Initial_Assessment** – Significant queuing and SLA exposure: **wait time** is high (18 min) versus other early steps, with **SLA breaches** at 3.2% and notable variability (stdev 4).  
**Action:** Rebalance staffing/capacity to match intake (Register_Claim 280/day vs Initial_Assessment 270/day); target wait **18 → <10 min** and SLA breaches **3.2% → <2%**.
