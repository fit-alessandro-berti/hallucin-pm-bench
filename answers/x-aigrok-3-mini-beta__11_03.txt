Subject: Analysis of Key Process Performance Issues

Dear COO,

Our review of Orion Credit's process data reveals the three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches and high waiting times: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds, with a waiting time of 600 seconds. Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with a waiting time of 480 seconds. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, with a waiting time of 200 seconds.

These issues impact efficiency and customer experience.

- For Legal Approval, reduce waiting time by prioritizing cases with 465 instances, potentially through resource allocation based on high waiting data.
- For Risk Review, address the 300-second exceedance by streamlining processes for its 480 cases, using the 480-second waiting time as a focus for workflow optimization.
- For Credit Assessment, mitigate the 60-second exceedance by targeting the 200-second waiting time, perhaps via faster reviews for its 1175 cases.
