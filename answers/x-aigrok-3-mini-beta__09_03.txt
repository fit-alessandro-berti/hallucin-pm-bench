I am unable to compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Approve Invoice”, along with its standard deviation and 95% confidence interval, because the event log in Artefact A contains only column headers and no actual data rows or timestamp values. The cycle time requires differences between start_time and complete_time for relevant activities, but with all rows redacted for privacy, there is no numerical data available to perform these calculations. Therefore, no metrics can be derived from the provided information.
