Let's carefully analyze the Petri net's structure and possible firing sequences to determine whether T5 can occur before T3.

---

### Initial marking:

- p0: 1 token
- p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6: 0 tokens

---

### Step 1: Can T5 fire initially?

- **Conditions for T5 to fire:**

  - Requires tokens in p3 (for normal arc) → **p3 must have ≥1 token**
  - Requires p4 to have **zero tokens** (inhibitor arc) → **p4 must be empty**

- **Initial marking**:

  - p3 = 0 (no), p4=0 (no)

- **Conclusion**: T5 is **initially enabled**? **No**, because p3 has zero tokens. Need T3 to produce tokens in p3 for T5 to fire.

---

### Step 2: Can T3 fire before T5?

- For T3 to fire:

  - P2 must have tokens

- Initially, p2=0. How can p2 gain tokens? via T1, which splits tokens from p0.

- T1 fires from p0 (with 1 token):

  - Firing T1 consumes 1 token from p0 (initially 1), adds 1 to p1 and 1 to p2

- **After T1 fires**:

  - p0=0
  - p1=1
  - p2=1
  - others=0

- Now, T3:

  - Consumes p2; as p2=1, T3 can fire, producing a token in p4.

---

### Step 3: Possible sequence to get T5 to fire *before* T3

- **Is that possible?**

- Initially:

  - p0=1, others=0

- **First**, can T5 fire?

  - No, because p3=0, p4=0

- **Next**, T1 must fire:

  1. T1: p0→p1 + p2

  - p0=1→0
  - p1=0→1
  - p2=0→1

- **Now**, T5:

  - Requires p3 tokens ≥1? No, p3=0
  - Requires p4=0 (yes), so T5 cannot fire yet.

- Now, T3:

  - p2=1, can fire:
  
  2. T3: p2→p4

     - p2:1→0
     - p4:0→1

- After T3:

  - p2=0, p4=1

- **Check T5 again**:

  - P3:0, P4:1 → T5 is **not enabled** (because inhibitor arc from p4 requires p4=0).

- **Conclusion**:

  - **T5 cannot fire before T3**, because:
    - To fire T5, p4 must be empty (p4=0).
    - But T3 produces p4 from p2.
    - Therefore, T3 must fire first to produce p4 tokens (which T5 requires to be zero).

---

### **Alternative attempt to enable T5 before T3:**

- Is it possible that p4 is zero after initial firing? No, because:

  - The only way p4 can be non-zero initially is via T3 (which is impossible without p2 tokens).

- **No initial firing of T1** can directly enable T5, because T1 produces tokens in p1 and p2, then T3 produces p4, which blocks T5 immediately.

- **No other path** exists to produce p4 tokens *before* T3 because:

  - T4 (p3 + p4→p5) requires both p3 and p4 to have tokens, but p3 can only be produced after T2, which requires p1, itself produced by T1.

---

### **Summary:**

- T5 is **initially disabled**, because p3=0 and p4=0.

- To enable T5, p3 must have tokens, which requires T2 (from p1) after T1.

- **T3 (p2→p4)** always requires the firing of T1 first.

- **Alternatively**, T5 cannot fire **before** T3 because:

  - T5 needs p4=0 and p3≥1.

  - P4 is produced by T3.

  - Therefore, T3 must happen **before** T5.

---

## **Final conclusion:**

> **In any reachable marking, transition T5 cannot fire before transition T3.**

---

### **Answer:**

**No, it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.**

---

### **Brief proof:**

- T5 requires p3≥1 and p4=0 for enabling.

- P4 is produced only by T3 (p2→p4).

- Initially, p3=0 and p4=0; T3 cannot have fired yet.

- To produce p4, T3 must fire, which itself requires tokens from T1.

- T5's inhibitor arc from p4 mandates p4=0, but T3's firing creates tokens in p4, blocking T5 until p4 is emptied again.

- Since T4 (p3 + p4→p5) consumes both tokens, T4's firing would temporarily remove tokens from p3 and p4, but **not** in a way that makes p4=0 and p3≥1 again simultaneously before T3.

- Therefore, **T5 cannot be enabled or fire before T3** in any reachable state.

---

**Thus, the answer: "No, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking."**
