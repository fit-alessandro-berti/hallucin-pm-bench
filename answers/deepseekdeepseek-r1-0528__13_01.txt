Based solely on the provided event-log fragment of 18 lines:

1. **Exactly how many times does "Manual_Fraud_Check" occur?**  
   **1 time** (observed only in Case A1002).

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent?**  
   (1 occurrence / 18 total events) Ã— 100 = **5.56%** (rounded to two decimal places).

3. **List case identifier(s) for "Manual_Fraud_Check"**  
   **A1002** (only case where this activity appears).

4. **Sampling-related reasons why monthly estimation is unreliable:**  
   - **Time period restriction:** The data spans only **a single day** (May 1, 2025), which cannot represent variations across a full month (e.g., daily/weekly fraud patterns).  
   - **Unrepresentative data size/sampling bias:** Only **one fraud check occurred** in the fragment, making it impossible to generalize trends for an entire month from a small, skewed sample.
