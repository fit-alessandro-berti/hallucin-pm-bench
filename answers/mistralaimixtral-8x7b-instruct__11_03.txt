Subject: Identifying and Addressing Orion Credit’s Three Worst-Performing Activities

Dear COO,

After analyzing the data provided, I have identified the three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches and high waiting time. These activities are:

1. **Risk Review**
   - Exceeds SLA by: 200 seconds (3 minutes, 20 seconds)
   - Recommendation: Implement a concurrent review process, dividing the review tasks among multiple analysts to reduce the overall processing time.

2. **Legal Approval**
   - Exceeds SLA by: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
   - Recommendation: Establish a priority-based approval system, where urgent cases are escalated to legal for faster turnaround times.

3. **Credit Assessment**
   - Exceeds SLA by: 60 seconds (1 minute)
   - Recommendation: Invest in automation tools and machine learning algorithms to streamline and expedite the credit assessment process.

These recommendations aim to improve the efficiency of these activities, reduce waiting times, and ensure better compliance with SLAs.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
