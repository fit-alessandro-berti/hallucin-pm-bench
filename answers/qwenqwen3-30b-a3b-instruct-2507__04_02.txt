R1: Violated – Total amount (€12,450) > €10,000, but Finance_Approval occurs after Manager_Approval, which is correct, but no violation in sequence. Wait, sequence is valid: Manager then Finance. So actually **Compliant** – both approvals present in correct order.

R1: Compliant – PO > €10,000; Manager_Approval (2025-03-03 11:05) before Finance_Approval (2025-03-04 08:17).✔️

R2: Violated – Expedited = true; last approval (Finance_Approval: 2025-03-04 08:17); Ship_Goods at 2025-03-05 10:26 → 1 day 2 hours, within 2 calendar days? From 2025-03-04 to 2025-03-05 is <2 calendar days → actually **Compliant**.

R2: Compliant – Last approval on 2025-03-04; Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 (within 2 calendar days).✔️

R3: Violated – Pay_Invoice at 2025-03-06 09:00; Receive_Goods at 2025-03-07 14:13 → Pay_Invoice BEFORE Receive_Goods → **Violated**.

R4: Not Applicable – hazardous = false → safety inspection not required.✔️

R5: Violated – Change_Request at 2025-03-04 15:42 (after Finance_Approval); but new Manager_Approval occurs at 2025-03-07 15:10 → after Pay_Invoice and Store_Goods, not *before* further processing. Required to have new approval *before* any further step. → Violated.

R6: Compliant – Case ends with Archive_Record at 2025-03-07 16:20.✔️

Overall result: **NON-COMPLIANT** (violations in R3 and R5).

Final Answer:
R1: Compliant – Manager then Finance approval in correct order for amount > €10,000.  
R2: Compliant – Ship_Goods within 2 calendar days of last approval.  
R3: Violated – Pay_Invoice occurred before Receive_Goods.  
R4: Not Applicable – Hazardous flag is false.  
R5: Violated – New Manager_Approval occurred after processing steps, not before.  
R6: Compliant – Case ends with Archive_Record.
