No

**Justification:**  
The fact is **incorrect** because the event log contains cases where "Validate_Payment" does **not** occur immediately after "Receive_Order" with no intervening activities.  

- **Case C002**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` (09:30) → `Pack_Items` (09:50) → `Validate_Payment` (10:05).  
  Here, "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".  

- **Case C004**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` (10:05) → `Check_Fraud` (10:07) → `Validate_Payment` (10:20).  
  Here, "Check_Fraud" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".  

These examples demonstrate that "Validate_Payment" is **not always** the immediate next activity after "Receive_Order", violating the claimed rule.
