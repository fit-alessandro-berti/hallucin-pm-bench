No. In cases C003 and C005, Validate_Payment occurs without being preceded by Receive_Order: line 6 (C003) has Validate_Payment before Receive_Order on line 7, and lines 11â€“12 (C005) show Validate_Payment followed by Cancel_Order with no Receive_Order present. Additionally, C002 includes an intermediate Check_Inventory between Receive_Order (line 3) and Validate_Payment (line 5), so Validate_Payment does not immediately follow Receive_Order there either. These violate the claim that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order.
