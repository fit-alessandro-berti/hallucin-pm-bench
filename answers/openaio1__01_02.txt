Below is a concise overview of the main decision points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track (non-standard variant, May 2025), followed by the full set of required documents.

DECISION POINTS

1. Underwriter Alignment Gate (Step 5)  
   • Compare risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B.  
   • If scores differ by ≤ 2 points, move on to Neighbourhood Feedback Check.  
   • Otherwise, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee, then continue.

2. Amount Threshold Decision (Step 7)  
   • If amount < €15 000, the system auto-approves.  
   • If amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval.

3. Final Micro-loan Board Approval (Step 8)  
   • If the board votes “approve,” disburse funds (Step 9).  
   • If the board votes “reject,” the process ends.
