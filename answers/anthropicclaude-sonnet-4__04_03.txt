**No**

**Justification:**

**Rule 1: VIOLATED** - Quality_Engineer_Review (QE) and Regulatory_Affairs_Review (RA) must occur "in that order," but in this trace RA occurs after Notify_Authorities, breaking the required QEâ†’RA sequence.

**Rule 2: VIOLATED** - Since severity = "High", VP_Safety_Approval must happen "after both QE and RA." However, VP occurs after RA but before RA has properly completed the required sequence with QE.

**Rule 3: VIOLATED** - Notify_Authorities occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review is complete, violating the requirement that NA must not occur until after both QE and RA are complete.

**Rule 4: SATISFIED** - Close_Case occurs after both Notify_Authorities and VP_Safety_Approval.

The trace fails compliance due to violations of rules 1, 2, and 3.
