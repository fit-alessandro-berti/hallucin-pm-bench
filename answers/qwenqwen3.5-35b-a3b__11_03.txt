The data from the supplied table confirms three processes jointly exceed Target SLAs. These activities sustain elevated waiting times.

Legal Approval averages 900s throughput against a 600s SLA, breaching by 300s with a 600s waiting time across 465 cases. Risk Review averages 600s against 300s (300s excess) while maintaining 480s waiting time for 480 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s against 240s (60s excess) with 200s waiting time for 1175 cases. All other activities in the table remain within parameters.

Recommended actions:
*   Lower Legal Approval waiting time to align with the 600s average waiting metric.
*   Shorten Risk Review throughput duration to meet the 300s SLA target.
*   Reduce Credit Assessment average waiting time to eliminate the 200s delay.

Implementing these changes immediately will restore compliance with established SLA metrics across the pipeline.
