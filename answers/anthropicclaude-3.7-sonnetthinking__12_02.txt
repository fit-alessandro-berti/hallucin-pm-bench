**No**, the stated fact is not accurate. In case C003, Validate_Payment occurs at 10:43 (line 6) before Receive_Order at 10:45 (line 7), showing a reversal of the claimed sequence. Additionally, in case C005, Validate_Payment appears (line 11) without any Receive_Order event in that case, making it impossible for Validate_Payment to follow Receive_Order as claimed.
