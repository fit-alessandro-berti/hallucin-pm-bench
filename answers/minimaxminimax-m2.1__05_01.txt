Add an interrupting timer boundary event to **Task_Receive** (id="Task_Receive") with a 48-hour duration. When the timer expires (indicating the claim hasn’t reached **Task_Triage** within 48 hours of submission), terminate Task_Receive and route the claim directly to Task_Triage. This ensures all claims reach Task_Triage within the SLA by auto-escalating delayed instances, without adding new tasks—only an event (boundary timer) and a reconnected flow to the existing Task_Triage.
