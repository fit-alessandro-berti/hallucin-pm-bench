2️⃣ **Misestimation risk (≤ 120 words):**  
This snippet covers only 3 cases from one morning (Mar 1). Manual fraud checks occur just once here, but this sample is too small and short to reflect full-month patterns. If manual checks primarily happen during high-volume periods (e.g., end-of-month) or for specific applicant types absent here, their true frequency could be higher. Conversely, a system update later in March might reduce manual checks, making this single instance unrepresentative. Sampling bias (e.g., missing weekends) or data quality issues (e.g., duplicated "Send Offer" entries suggesting logging errors) could further distort perception. Extrapolation from this limited view risks significant error.
