A low-support activity like Manual_Fraud_Check (appearing in only 1 of 12 cases and 1 of 48 events) may appear insignificant in this small excerpt, misleading analyses by suggesting it rarely happens. Generalizing could underestimate its true frequency in the full log, leading to flawed performance metrics (e.g., inaccurate cycle times) or predictive models (e.g., missing fraud detection needs), as it disrupts process patterns in a way not fully captured here.
