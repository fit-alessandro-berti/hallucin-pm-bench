**Executive Memo**

To: COO, Acme Insurance

The Q1-2025 performance dashboard for Claims Handling highlights areas for improvement. The three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Request_Documents**: High average wait time (150 minutes) and rework rate (22.0%) indicate inefficiencies. Recommendation: Implement a digital document request process to reduce wait times and minimize manual errors.
2. **Review_Documents**: Long average processing time (25 minutes) and high rework rate (5.3%) suggest complexity. Recommendation: Provide additional training to reviewers to enhance efficiency and accuracy.
3. **Initial_Assessment**: High average wait time (18 minutes) and SLA breach rate (3.2%) indicate capacity issues. Recommendation: Allocate additional resources to this step to reduce wait times and improve assessment efficiency.

These targeted improvements can help optimize the Claims Handling process, reducing delays and enhancing overall performance.
