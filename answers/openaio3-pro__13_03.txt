1️⃣  The activity string “Manual Fraud Check” appears 1 time in the excerpt.

2️⃣  The excerpt contains events from only three cases (1001-1003) and spans less than two hours on a single day. With such a narrow time window and tiny case sample, the observed mix of automatic versus manual fraud checks may not reflect their distribution in the complete month-long log. If later cases, other days, or different process variants include many more (or far fewer) manual checks, that information is absent here; the analyst sees just one manual instance. Relying on this snippet alone therefore risks under- or over-estimating the true proportion of manual fraud checks in March 2025.
