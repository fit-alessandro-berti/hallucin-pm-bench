Executive snapshot: Q1-2025 performance bottlenecks are concentrated in the Document intake and early assessment steps.

Request_Documents
- Why worst: extreme queueing before the activity (avg_wait_time_min 150) and very high rework (22.0%), with a moderate SLA breach (5.5%).
- Action: implement an upfront Document Intake portal with automated validation and a dedicated intake queue; require key documents at submission. Track weekly avg_wait_time_min and rework rate, targeting wait ≤60 minutes and rework ≤8% within 8 weeks.

Review_Documents
- Why worst: long processing (25 min) and wait (30 min) with high variability (stdev 9), high rework (5.3%), and highest SLA breach (12.4%).
- Action: standardize document requirements and enable parallel/batch review with simple automated checks. Target processing time 15 minutes and SLA breach <5% within 6 weeks.

Initial_Assessment
- Why worst: second-highest wait (18) and substantial processing time (12) with moderate variability; rework 1.8% and SLA breach 3.2%.
- Action: front-load inputs via a pre-assessment checklist and gating to ensure complete data before assessment. Target wait 8–10 minutes and SLA breach <3% within 6 weeks.
