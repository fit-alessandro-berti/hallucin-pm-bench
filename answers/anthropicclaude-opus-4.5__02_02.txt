I'll analyze this XES event log fragment systematically.

## Q1: Distinct Cases

Looking at all the `case` attributes in the log:
- C001 (lines 1, 3, 7)
- C002 (lines 2, 5, 8, 10)
- C003 (lines 4, 6, 9)

**Answer: 3 distinct cases**

## Q2: Sequence of Activities for Case "C002"

Extracting events for C002 in chronological order:
- Line 2: `Receive_Order` (09:15:10)
- Line 5: `Check_Stock` (09:22:55)
- Line 8: `Arrange_Delivery` (10:15:20)
- Line 10: `Ship_Order` (10:25:40)

**Answer: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

## Q3: Distinct Activities Immediately Preceding "Ship_Order"

Finding all "Ship_Order" events and their immediate predecessors within each case:

**C001:**
- Ship_Order at line 7 (10:05:10)
- Previous C001 event: Check_Stock at line 3 (09:20:05)
- Predecessor: **Check_Stock**

**C003:**
- Ship_Order at line 9 (10:20:30)

**C002:**
- Ship_Order at line 10 (10:25:40)
- Previous C002 event: Arrange_Delivery at line 8 (10:15:20)
