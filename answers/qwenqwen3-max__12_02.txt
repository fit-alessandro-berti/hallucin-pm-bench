No

The claim is false because in Case C003 (lines 6–7), Validate_Payment (line 6, 10:43:00Z) occurs *before* Receive_Order (line 7, 10:45:00Z), directly contradicting the assertion that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order. Additionally, Case C005 (lines 11–12) begins with Validate_Payment (line 11) without any preceding Receive_Order at all. These two counterexamples from the ground-truth log fragment conclusively invalidate the “always follows” rule.
