No. The claim is contradicted by cases C003 and C005: in C003, *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 6 before *Receive_Order* at line 7; in C005, *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 11 but is followed by *Cancel_Order* at line 12 with no *Receive_Order* event at all. Thus, *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* in the log fragment.
