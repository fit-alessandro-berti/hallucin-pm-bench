Yes, it is possible for **T5** to fire before **T3**.  
One shortest firing sequence is:  

**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**  

- After **T1**: tokens in *pa* and *pb*.  
- After **T2b**: consumes *pa*, produces *pd* → tokens in *pb* and *pd*.  
- After **T4**: consumes *pb*, produces *pe* → tokens in *pd* and *pe*.  
- **T5** is now enabled (needs *pd* and *pe*), consumes them, and produces *pf*.  

In this sequence, **T5** fires at the fourth step and **T3** has not fired at any prior step. The shortcut **T2b** provides *pd* without requiring *pc*, so **T3** is not needed to enable **T5**.
