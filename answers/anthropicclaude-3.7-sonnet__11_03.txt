# EXECUTIVE MEMO

TO: Chief Operating Officer, Orion Credit
FROM: Senior Process-Performance Analyst
SUBJECT: Critical Process Bottlenecks Requiring Immediate Attention

Analysis of our credit application process reveals three severely underperforming activities:

Risk Review exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (100%), with customers waiting 480 seconds—representing 80% of total throughput time. 

Credit Assessment exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds (25%), with customers waiting 200 seconds—representing 67% of total throughput time.

Legal Approval exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (50%), with customers waiting 600 seconds—representing 67% of total throughput time.

Recommended actions:

• Risk Review: Redistribute workload by reassigning 50% of cases requiring extended review to specialized analysts, targeting reduction of waiting time to under 240 seconds.

• Credit Assessment: Implement parallel processing for standard verification checks to reduce waiting time by at least 100 seconds.

• Legal Approval: Create standardized templates for common scenarios, potentially reducing throughput time by 300 seconds to meet the 600-second SLA.
