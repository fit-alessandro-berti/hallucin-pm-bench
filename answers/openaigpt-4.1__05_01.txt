Add an **intermediate boundary timer event** to the task “Receive Claim” (`Task_Receive`) or “Check Completeness” (`Task_Check`).  
Set the timer to trigger **48 hours after “Claim Submitted” (`Start_Claim`)**.  
Connect the timer's outgoing flow directly to “Triage Claim” (`Task_Triage`).  
This ensures that if the claim does not progress naturally to `Task_Triage` within 48 hours, it is automatically routed there, meeting the SLA.  
No new activities are needed—only a boundary event and a new sequence flow.
