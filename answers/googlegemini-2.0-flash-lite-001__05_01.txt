To enforce the 48-hour SLA for "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage), implement a timer.

1.  Insert a **Intermediate Catch Event** of type "timer" directly after "Task_Receive" (f2). Give it an ID, such as "Timer_SLA".
2.  Set this timer to trigger after a duration of 48 hours.
3.  Connect the timer to "Task_Triage" via a new flow, let's say "f10".
4.  Modify the flow from "Task\_Check" (f3) to "GW\_Docs", so this flow will also feed "Task\_Triage".

This ensures that if the claim isn't triaged within 48 hours, the timer triggers, and the claim is sent to "Task\_Triage", thus meeting the SLA, without creating a new task, or subprocess.
