1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ This snippet contains only three cases and a short time window on a single day. Sampling bias is likely: the selected cases may not be representative of the full month’s workload, channels, risk profiles, or times of day. Naming inconsistency (“Manual Fraud Check” vs. “Manual Review” vs. “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) can also hide additional manual checks in the full log. Finally, the excerpt may exclude cases still in progress or handled in other subprocesses, so an analyst could easily over- or underestimate how often manual fraud checks occur overall.
