## Change Summary: Loan_Process v1 → v2

---

### Added Tasks

| Task ID | Task Name |
|---|---|
| `Task_VerifyIdentity` | Verify Identity |
| `Task_RequestDocs` | Request Additional Documents |
| `Task_FinalReject` | Final Reject |

- **Verify Identity** is inserted between the Start event and Review Application, becoming the new first step in the flow.
- **Request Additional Documents** and **Final Reject** are added as new outgoing branches from the gateway, both terminating at the End event.

---

### Removed Tasks

| Task ID | Task Name |
|---|---|
| `Task_RejectLoan` | Reject Loan |

- The single binary rejection path is replaced by the two more granular tasks above (`Task_RequestDocs` and `Task_FinalReject`).

---

### Gateway-Type Changes

| Gateway ID | v1 Type | v2 Type | Name Change (non-cosmetic implication) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Gateway_Decision` | `exclusiveGateway` | `inclusiveGateway` | Now supports **multiple simultaneous outgoing paths** |

- In v1 the gateway was **Exclusive (XOR)**: exactly one path fired (yes / no).
- In v2 the gateway is **Inclusive (OR)**: one *or more* of the three branches (`eligible`, `missing docs`, `ineligible`) can fire concurrently, fundamentally changing the routing semantics of the eligibility decision.
