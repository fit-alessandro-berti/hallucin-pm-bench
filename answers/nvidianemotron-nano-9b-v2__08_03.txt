Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking. 

**Shortest firing sequence:**  
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5  

**Explanation:**  
1. **T1** fires, consuming p0 and producing pa and pb.  
2. **T2b** fires, consuming pa and producing pd (skipping T2 and T3).  
3. **T4** fires, consuming pb and producing pe.  
4. **T5** fires, consuming pd and pe (both available from T2b and T4) to produce pf.  

In this sequence, T3 never fires, so T5 fires before T3.
