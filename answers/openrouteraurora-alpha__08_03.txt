**Answer: Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**  

The shortest firing sequence that makes T5 fire while T3 is still disabled is  

```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```

### Why this sequence works  

| step | transition fired | marking (tokens in places) |
|------|------------------|----------------------------|
| 0    | – (initial)      | p0 = 1, pa = pb = pc = pd = pe = pf = 0 |
| 1    | **T1** (p0 → pa, pb) | pa = 1, pb = 1, all others 0 |
| 2    | **T2b** (pa → pd)    | pd = 1, pb = 1, all others 0 |
| 3    | **T4** (pb → pe)     | pd = 1, pe = 1, all others 0 |
| 4    | **T5** (pd, pe → pf) | pf = 1, all others 0 |

* After step 3 the marking contains a token in **pd** and a token in **pe**, therefore **T5** is enabled.  
* At that moment **pc** is empty, so **T3** (which requires a token in pc) is **not** enabled.  

Thus T5 fires **before** any occurrence of T3.

### Minimality argument  

To enable T5 we must have a token in both **pd** and **pe**:

* **pe** can only be produced by **T4**, which needs a token in **pb**.  
* **pd** can be produced either by **T3** (needs **pc**) or by **T2b** (needs **pa**).

Since we want T5 to fire *before* T3, we cannot rely on T3 to generate pd; we must use the shortcut **T2b**.

Both **pa** and **pb** are created simultaneously by the single transition **T1**. Consequently the smallest set of transitions that can generate the required tokens is:

1. **T1** – creates pa and pb.  
2. **T2b** – consumes pa and creates pd.  
3. **T4** – consumes pb and creates pe.  
4. **T5** – consumes pd and pe.

No shorter sequence can provide both pd and pe simultaneously, because at least one transition is needed to produce each of the two input places of T5, and both of those tokens depend on the initial split T1. Hence the sequence above (four transitions) is the **shortest** possible.
