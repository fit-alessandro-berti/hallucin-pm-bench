**Executive Memo: Process Performance Review**  
Three activities are critical underperformers, exceeding SLAs and incurring high waiting times:  

1. **Legal Approval**: Exceeds SLA by **300s** (avg. throughput time: 900s vs. target: 600s) with an avg. waiting time of 600s.  
2. **Risk Review**: Exceeds SLA by **300s** (600s vs. 300s) with an avg. waiting time of 480s.  
3. **Credit Assessment**: Exceeds SLA by **60s** (300s vs. 240s) with an avg. waiting time of 200s.  

**Recommendations**:  
- For **Legal Approval**, implement automated document verification tools to reduce manual review time.  
- For **Risk Review**, allocate additional reviewers during peak hours to address the 480s avg. waiting time.  
- For **Credit Assessment**, streamline data validation steps to cut 60s from throughput time without compromising accuracy.  

These actions target root causes of delays while aligning with SLA requirements.
