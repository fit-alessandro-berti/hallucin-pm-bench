Memorandum  
**To:** Chief Operations Officer, Orion Credit  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Identification of Critical Bottlenecks and Remediation Actions  

The following **three worst-performing activities** jointly breach SLAs and exhibit excessive waiting time:  
  
- **Risk Review** exceeds Target_SLA by **300s** (Avg_Throughput_Time: 600s > 300s SLA) with **480s waiting time**.  
- **Legal Approval** exceeds Target_SLA by **300s** (Avg_Throughput_Time: 900s > 600s SLA) with **600s waiting time**.  
- **Credit Assessment** exceeds Target_SLA by **60s** (Avg_Throughput_Time: 300s > 240s SLA) with **200s waiting time**.  
  
Recommendations:  
• Allocate dedicated personnel to **Legal Approval** to reduce queue delays, as its **600s waiting time equals 66% of total throughput**.  
• Reengineer **Risk Review** workflows, prioritizing automation of manual steps, given its **highest SLA breach (300s)** and **80% waiting time contribution (480s/600s)**.  
• Cross-train staff from non-breach activities (e.g., Fund Disbursement) to support **Credit Assessment**, where **200s waiting time represents 67% of throughput**.
