No. T5 cannot fire before T3.

Reason: From the initial marking, only T1 is enabled. Firing T1 produces tokens in p1 and p2. For T5 to be enabled, we need a token in p3 and zero tokens in p4. The only way to get a token in p3 is to fire T2 (consuming p1). After T2, we have tokens in p3 and p2; p4 is still empty, so T5 is now enabled. However, to have T5 fire “before T3,” T3 must not yet have fired. But T3 is enabled immediately after T1 (since p2 has a token), and T5 requires p3, which can only be obtained by firing T2 first. At the moment T5 becomes enabled (after T2), T3 is also enabled (since p2 is still marked). Because transitions are instantaneous and we compare order by occurrence, the earliest point T5 could fire is after T2, but then T3 is concurrently enabled and could fire first or later—however, T5 firing “before T3” would still require that T3 has not fired yet.

But T5 consumes p3 and has an inhibitor from p4 only; it does not consume p2. So firing T5 before T3 would require the marking after T2 (p3=1, p2=1, p4=0), where T5 is enabled and T3 is also enabled. If T5 fires now, does that violate anything? Wait: T5’s inhibitor only checks p4=0, which holds before T3 fires. So T5 can indeed fire right now, before T3. But this contradicts the “No” claim—so we must correct: It is possible.

Concrete firing sequence:
T1; T2; T5

Marking evolution:
M0: p0=1
After T1: p1=1, p2=1
After T2: p3=1, p2=1
Here p4=0, so T5 is enabled (inhibitor satisfied), and T3 has not fired yet. Fire T5:
After T5: p6=1, p2=1 (p3 consumed), p4 still 0.

Thus T5 has fired before T3. Justification: T5 requires p3 and absence of a token in p4; after T2 (but before T3), these conditions hold.
