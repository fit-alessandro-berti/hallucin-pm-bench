No, the fact is **not** accurate in this event-log fragment.

- **Case 1001:** `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund` (`Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund`). So `Authorize_Refund` is **not** immediately before `Update_Inventory`.
- **Case 1003:** `Update_Inventory` also occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund`, and there is an intervening step after inventory update (`Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund`). Again, `Authorize_Refund` is **not** immediately before `Update_Inventory`.
- **Case 1002:** There is **no** `Update_Inventory` event at all (sequence: `Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued`), so the “always occurs immediately before” relation cannot hold here either.
