**No**

The claim is inaccurate because there are instances where Validate_Payment does not follow Receive_Order. In case C003 (lines 6-7), Validate_Payment occurs at 10:43:00Z before Receive_Order occurs at 10:45:00Z, showing the reverse order. Additionally, in case C005 (lines 11-12), Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order activity in the log fragment. While cases C001, C002, and C004 do show Validate_Payment following Receive_Order, the word "always" in the claim makes it false since there are clear counterexamples.
