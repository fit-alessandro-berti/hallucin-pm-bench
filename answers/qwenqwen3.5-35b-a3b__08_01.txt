**Yes**, it is possible for transition $T_5$ to fire before transition $T_3$.

### Firing Sequence
A concrete valid firing sequence from the initial marking $M_0$ is:
$$ \langle T_1, \quad T_2, \quad T_5 \rangle $$

### Justification
We analyze the reachability of the markings step-by-step to verify that $T_5$ is enabled while $T_3$ has not yet fired:

1.  **Initial Marking ($M_0$):**
    $M_0 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ for places $(p_0, \dots, p_6)$.
    Only $T_1$ is enabled.

2.  **Fire $T_1$:**
    Consumes token from $p_0$; produces tokens in $p_1$ and $p_2$.
    **Marking $M_1$:** $(0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)$.
    Enabled transitions: $T_2$ (needs $p_1$) and $T_3$ (needs $p_2$).

3.  **Fire $T_2$:**
    Consumes token from $p_1$; produces token in $p_3$.
    **Marking $M_2$:** $(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)$.
    *(Note: $T_3$ has not fired yet; the token from $T_1$ in $p_2$ remains.)*

4.  **Check Enablement of $T_5$:**
    *   **Input Arc:** Requires token in $p_3$. ($M_2(p_3) = 1$) $\rightarrow$ **Satisfied**.
    *   **Inhibitor Arc:** Requires $p_4$ to contain **zero** tokens. ($M_2(p_4) = 0$) $\rightarrow$ **Satisfied**.
    *   Since $T_3$ has not fired, $p_4$ is still empty.
    *   **Result:** $T_5$ is **enabled**.

5.  **Fire $T_5$:**
    Consumes token from $p_3$; produces token in $p_6$.
    **Marking $M_3$:** $(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)$.
    *(Note: $T_3$ is still pending but has not fired yet.)*

Since $T_5$ fires in step 3 and $T_3$ has not fired in the preceding steps, $T_5$ fires **before** $T_3$ in this sequence. 

*(Note: If $T_3$ were to fire before $T_5$ at step 2, it would place a token in $p_4$, activating the inhibitor arc and permanently disabling $T_5$. Therefore, the only way for $T_5$ to fire at all is for $T_3$ to be postponed.)*
