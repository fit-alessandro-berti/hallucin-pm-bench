Non-compliant

1. Rule 1 is violated: The PO amount (€12 300) exceeds €10 000, requiring two approvals (Procurement Officer and CFO) before `Issue_PO`. In the trace, `Approve_PO` (Procurement Officer) and `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO) occur before `Issue_PO`, so the approvals are present. However, the sequence of approvals is correct, so Rule 1 is satisfied.

2. Rule 2 is violated: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` at position 4, making `Risk_Assessment` mandatory before the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Risk_Assessment` occurs at position 9, after `Ship_Goods` at position 8. Therefore, Rule 2 is violated.

3. Rule 3 is satisfied: After `Goods_Received` (position 6), `Three_way_match` occurs at position 10, which is within two activities (positions 7 and 8 are between them, so the distance is 3, which violates the rule). Therefore, Rule 3 is violated.

4. Rule 4 is satisfied: No activity executed by the role **Intern** directly follows an activity executed by the role **CFO**. The **Intern** role occurs at position 7, after `Ship_Goods` (position 8) and `Risk_Assessment` (position 9), not directly after **CFO**.

5. Rule 5 is satisfied: The trace finishes with `Archive_Record` and contains nothing after it.

The trace is non-compliant due to violations of Rules 2 and 3.
