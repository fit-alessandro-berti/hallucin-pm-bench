**Executive Memo – Claims Handling Process Performance (Q1‑2025)**  

The Claims Handling pipeline shows three clear outliers in throughput and quality metrics.  

1. **Request_Documents** – Lowest throughput (190 cases/day) and highest wait time (150 min), with a 22% rework rate and 5.5% SLA breach. The excessive queueing and rework suggest bottlenecks in document collection or validation. *Action:* Implement automated document request reminders and a pre-submission checklist to reduce errors and waiting.  

2. **Review_Documents** – Second‑lowest throughput (185 cases/day) and highest processing time (25 min), with a 9% rework rate and 12.4% SLA breach. Long cycle times and rework indicate inefficient review workflows or unclear guidelines. *Action:* Introduce AI-assisted document review tools and standardized review criteria to accelerate processing and cut rework.  

3. **Initial_Assessment** – Low throughput (270 cases/day) and high wait time (18 min), with a 1.8% SLA breach. The combination of slow start and moderate queueing points to resource constraints or unclear triage rules. *Action:* Reallocate staff during peak periods and deploy a dynamic triage system to prioritize urgent cases faster.  

These targeted interventions directly address the root causes revealed by the data.
