Based solely on the provided artefacts, I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice."

The precise reason is that Artefact A, the event-log stub, contains no actual data. Although the column names (including `activity`, `start_time`, and `complete_time`) indicate what information *would* be present in a complete log, every row of data and every timestamp value have been redacted for privacy. Artefact B provides a historical, aggregate KPI for the time between two activities ("Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice"), but it does not contain the individual timestamp pairs required to calculate the duration, statistical spread, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity itself. Therefore, the necessary raw data to perform these specific calculations is unavailable.
