No.

The fact that "Validate_Payment" always follows "Receive_Order" is not accurate according to the log fragment. In case C003, the event "Validate_Payment" occurs before "Receive_Order" as evidenced by lines 6 and 7, respectively. This directly contradicts the claim that "Validate_Payment" always follows "Receive_Order".
