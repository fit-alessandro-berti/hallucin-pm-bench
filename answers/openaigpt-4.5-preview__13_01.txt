1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs exactly **1 time** in this fragment.

2. There are 18 logged events, and "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs once, so the percentage it represents is:  
\[
\frac{1}{18} \times 100\% \approx 5.56\%
\]

3. The case identifier(s) containing **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** is(are): **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable:  
   - **Small sample size**: With only 4 cases, the sample size is too small to yield meaningful statistical inference for estimating a monthly occurrence frequency.
   - **Short sampling period**: The fragment covers only events recorded over a single day. Events can fluctuate greatly from day to day; thus, a single-day sampling window is insufficient for accurate monthly estimations.
