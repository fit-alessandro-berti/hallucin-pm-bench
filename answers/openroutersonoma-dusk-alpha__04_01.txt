Non-compliant

1. **Rule 1 violation**: The PO amount (€12 300) exceeds €10 000, requiring two approvals (Procurement Officer then CFO) before `Issue_PO`. While both approvals occur (events 2 and 3), `Expedite_Flag` (event 4) is inserted between the CFO approval (event 3) and `Issue_PO` (event 5), meaning `Issue_PO` does not immediately follow the required approvals without an intervening activity.
