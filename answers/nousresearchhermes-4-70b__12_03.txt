No

The FACT is **not** accurate. Here's the justification using events from the log:

1.  **Case C002**: The sequence is **Receive_Order** -> **Pack_Items** -> **Validate_Payment**.
    *   Timestamps: Receive_Order: 2025-01-03T09:30:00; Pack_Items: 2025-01-03T09:50:00; Validate_Payment: 2025-01-03T10:05:00.
    *   In this case, "Validate_Payment" does **not** occur immediately after "Receive_Order". Instead, "Pack_Items" occurs in between.

2.  **Case C004**: The sequence is **Receive_Order** -> **Check_Fraud** -> **Validate_Payment**.
    *   Timestamps: Receive_Order: 2025-01-03T10:05:00; Check_Fraud: 2025-01-03T10:07:00; Validate_Payment: 2025-01-03T10:20:00.
    *   In this case, "Validate_Payment" does **not** occur immediately after "Receive_Order". Instead, "Check_Fraud" occurs in between.

These two cases demonstrate that the activity "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order".
