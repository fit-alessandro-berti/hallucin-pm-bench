1. Average cycle time of “Approve Invoice”
   The exact average cannot be computed because the event log contains only the column headers (start_time, complete_time) but no actual timestamp values for any case. Without the raw timestamps for the “Approve Invoice” activity, the duration of each occurrence is unknown.

2. Standard deviation and 95 % confidence interval
   Both metrics require the individual cycle times of every “Approve Invoice” instance, which are missing from the redacted log. Therefore, neither the standard deviation nor the confidence interval can be calculated.
