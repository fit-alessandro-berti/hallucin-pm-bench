1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because this snippet contains only 3 cases, with just 1 instance of "Manual Fraud Check." This small sample may not represent the full March 2025 log. If the full log includes many more cases, the proportion of manual reviews could be higher or lower. Additionally, manual checks might occur more frequently under certain conditions (e.g., high-risk applications) not evident here. Sampling bias or temporal clustering (e.g., more manual checks later in the month) could also distort inference. Thus, generalizing from this limited data risks inaccurate conclusions about overall process behavior.
