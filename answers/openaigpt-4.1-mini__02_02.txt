### Q1: How many **distinct cases** are present?

Cases appearing are:  
- C001  
- C002  
- C003  

**Answer:** 3

---

### Q2: For case **“C002”**, list the **sequence of activities** in the order they occurred.

Extract all events with case `C002` (in timestamp order):

- Line 2: Receive_Order  
- Line 5: Check_Stock  
- Line 8: Arrange_Delivery  
- Line 10: Ship_Order  

Sequence:  
**Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

---

### Q3: Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

Find every event where the next event (in same case) is "Ship_Order". For each case:

- **C001**:  
  Events in order:  
  Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
  Activity before Ship_Order: **Check_Stock**
  
- **C002**:  
  Events:  
  Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
  Activity before Ship_Order: **Arrange_Delivery**
  
- **C003**:  
  Events:  
  Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
  Activity before Ship_Order: **Check_Stock**

List distinct predecessors:  
- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock

Alphabetical order:

- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock

# **Final Answers:**

**Q1:** 3

**Q2:** Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

**Q3:**
