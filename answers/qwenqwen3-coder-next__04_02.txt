R1: Violated — Finance_Approval occurred before Manager_Approval, but Manager_Approval should precede Finance_Approval; sequence is reversed.  
R2: Violated — Ship_Goods occurred on 2025-03-05 (1 day after last required approval at 2025-03-04 08:17), but Change_Request after approvals invalidated prior approval timing; new Manager_Approval needed per R5 before Ship_Goods, which came too early.  
R3: Violated — Pay_Invoice (03-06 09:00) occurred before Receive_Goods (03-07 14:13), violating the precedence requirement.  
R4: Not Applicable — hazardous = false, so Safety_Inspection is not required.  
R5: Violated — Change_Request occurred after approvals (step 4), but no new Manager_Approval was obtained *before* Ship_Goods (step 5); new Manager_Approval came only after Ship_Goods (step 8).  
R6: Compliant — case ends with Archive_Record at step 10.
