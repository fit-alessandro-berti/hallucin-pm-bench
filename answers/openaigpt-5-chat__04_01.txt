**Non-compliant**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1 (Approvals before Issue_PO)** – Since the PO amount is €12 300 (> €10 000), two approvals are required **before** `Issue_PO`:  
   - Approve_PO by Procurement_Officer (**#2**) ✅  
   - Approve_PO_CFO by CFO (**#3**) ✅  
   Both occur before `Issue_PO` (**#5**), so Rule 1 is satisfied.

2. **Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag → Risk_Assessment before Ship_Goods)** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (**#4**), so `Quality_Check` is optional, but `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` is at **#8**, while `Risk_Assessment` is at **#9** (after shipping). This violates Rule 2.

3. **Rule 3 (Three_way_match within 2 activities after Goods_Received)** – `Goods_Received` is at **#6**. The next two activities are **#7** (Move_to_Quality) and **#8** (Ship_Goods). `Three_way_match` occurs at **#10**, which is 4 steps after `Goods_Received`, violating the "distance ≤ 2" constraint.

4. **Rule 4 (No Intern directly after CFO)** – CFO activity (**#3**) is followed by `Expedite_Flag` by System (**#4**), so there is no prohibited CFO→Intern sequence. Rule 4 is satisfied.

5. **Rule 5 (Ends with Archive_Record)** – The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (**#11**) and nothing follows it, so Rule 5 is satisfied.

**Conclusion:**  
Violations of **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** make this trace **Non-compliant**.
