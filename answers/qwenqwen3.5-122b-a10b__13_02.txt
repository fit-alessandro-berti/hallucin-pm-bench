1. **1** time.

2.  
   a) **2.08%** (1 event / 48 total events)  
   b) **8.33%** (1 case / 12 total cases)

3. With only one occurrence (2.08% of events, 8.33% of cases), this activity is statistically insignificant for generalization. Performance metrics like average duration become highly sensitive to outliers, skewing overall process efficiency estimates. Predictive models lack sufficient training data to learn patterns associated with this path, leading to high error rates for similar future cases. Process discovery algorithms may treat it as noise, omitting critical exception handling flows. Consequently, decisions based on this slice risk ignoring rare but high-impact variants, compromising compliance and resource planning.
