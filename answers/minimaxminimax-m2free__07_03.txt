<think>
First, I need to compare the two BPMN XML snippets for the Claims_Process fragment. I have to list only verifiable differences, grouped under the three headings: ADDED TASKS, REMOVED TASKS, and GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES.

Starting with tasks:

In BPMN_v1, the tasks are:

- userTask id="Task_ReceiveClaim" name="Receive Claim"

- serviceTask id="Task_ValidateCoverage" name="Validate Coverage"

- userTask id="Task_ManualReview" name="Manual Review"

- serviceTask id="Task_ApproveClaim" name="Approve Claim"

- serviceTask id="Task_RejectClaim" name="Reject Claim"

In BPMN_v2, the tasks are:

- userTask id="Task_ReceiveClaim" name="Receive Claim" – same as v1

- serviceTask id="Task_ValidateCoverage" name="Validate Coverage" – same as v1

- serviceTask id="Task_FraudCheck" name="Automated Fraud Check" – new in v2

- serviceTask id="Task_FastTrackApproval" name="Fast-Track Approval" – new in v2

- serviceTask id="Task_ApproveClaim" name="Approve Claim" – same as v1

- serviceTask id="Task_RejectClaim" name="Reject Claim" – same as v1

- sendTask id="Task_NotifyCustomer" name="Notify Customer" – new in v2

Also, in v1, there was a userTask id="Task_ManualReview" name="Manual Review", which is not in v2. So, that task has been removed.

In v2, I see new tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, and Task_NotifyCustomer. And Task_ManualReview is missing.

Now, for gateways:

In BPMN_v1:

- exclusiveGateway id="Gateway_ReviewNeeded" gatewayDirection="Diverging"

- exclusiveGateway id="Gateway_Payment" gatewayDirection="Converging"

In BPMN_v2:

- parallelGateway id="Gateway_ReviewNeeded" gatewayDirection="Diverging"

- parallelGateway id="Gateway_Payment" gatewayDirection="Converging"

So, both gateways have changed from exclusive to parallel.

Now, summarizing:

ADDED TASKS: These are tasks present in v2 but not in v1.

From above:

- Task_FraudCheck (serviceTask)

- Task_FastTrackApproval (serviceTask)

- Task_NotifyCustomer (sendTask)

But Task_FastTrackApproval might be related to something, but I don't need to comment, just list them.

In v2, after Gateway_ReviewNeeded, it goes to Task_FraudCheck and Task_FastTrackApproval, whereas in v1, it went directly to Task_ManualReview. But since I'm only listing added or removed tasks, not the flow, I just need to compare the task elements themselves.

REMOVED TASKS: Tasks present in v1 but not in v2.

- Task_ManualReview (userTask)

That's the only one missing from v2.

GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES:

- Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel

- Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel

Both gateways changed type.

Now, I need to present this under the three headings.

For tasks, I should give id and name as per instruction.

For gateways, id and change.

Also, no commentary, just the differences.

Let me list them clearly.

ADDED TASKS:

- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)

- Task_FastTrackApproval (Fast-Track Approval)

- Task_NotifyCustomer (Notify Customer)

But Task_NotifyCustomer is a sendTask, but the task type might not be necessary; I think I just need id and name as specified.

The instruction says: "For tasks, give the id followed by the name in parentheses." It doesn't specify to include the type, so just id and name.

Similarly for gateways, only id and the change.

REMOVED TASKS:

- Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)

GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES:

- Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel

- Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel

In v2, Gateway_ReviewNeeded is parallelGateway, and in v1 it was exclusiveGateway, so yes.

Also, in v1, after Gateway_ReviewNeeded, it has outgoing sequence flows to Task_ManualReview? But I don't need to worry about the flow; the differences are in the elements themselves.

In v2, after Gateway_ReviewNeeded, it has outgoing flows to Task_FraudCheck and Task_FastTrackApproval, but since Gateway_ReviewNeeded is parallel, it should have multiple outgoing flows, which is consistent with v2 having two tasks.

But again, I don't need to analyze the flow, just the changes in elements.

So, to confirm:

Added tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer

Removed tasks: Task_ManualReview

Gateway changes: both gateways from exclusive to parallel.

Now, for the output format:

I need to have the three headings verbatim: ADDED TASKS, REMOVED TASKS, GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES

And under each, list the items.

Also, no other text.

So, something like:

ADDED TASKS
- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)
- Task_FastTrackApproval (Fast-Track Approval)
- Task_NotifyCustomer (Notify Customer)

REMOVED TASKS
- Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)

GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES
- Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel
- Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel

But I need to make sure about the ids and names.

In v2, Task_FastTrackApproval is a serviceTask with name "Fast-Track Approval", but I don't need to specify the type.

Similarly, Task_NotifyCustomer is sendTask, but again, just id and name.

Also, in the gateway changes, I have two entries.

Is there any other task?

In v1, no Task_FastTrackApproval or others, yes.

And Task_ManualReview is removed.

Also, note that in v1, Task_ApproveClaim and Task_RejectClaim are present in both, so unchanged, not mentioned.

Similarly for gateways, id are the same, but type changed.

So, I think that's all.

Now, to write the output.
