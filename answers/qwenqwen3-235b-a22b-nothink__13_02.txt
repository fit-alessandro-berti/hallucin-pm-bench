A rare activity like “Manual_Fraud_Check” (1/48 events) can skew analysis by creating misleading patterns. Performance metrics (e.g., duration) lack reliability with single occurrences. Predictive models may overfit or ignore its significance, risking errors in fraud detection. Rare paths (e.g., manual checks) might represent critical exceptions but are underrepresented, leading to generalized assumptions that fail in edge cases.
