## Analysis

**The fact is NOT accurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

## Justification

The claim states that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately *before* "Update_Inventory." However, the data shows the opposite pattern or no relationship at all:

### Case 1001:
- **Update_Inventory** occurs at 08:25:55
- **Authorize_Refund** occurs at 08:30:02

Here, Update_Inventory occurs *before* Authorize_Refund, not after it.

### Case 1002:
- **Authorize_Refund** occurs at 10:18:40
- **Refund_Issued** occurs at 10:25:10
- **Update_Inventory does not appear** in this case at all.

### Case 1003:
- **Update_Inventory** occurs at 10:08:07
- **Authorize_Refund** occurs at 10:22:18

Again, Update_Inventory occurs *before* Authorize_Refund, with "Quality_Check" in between.

## Conclusion

In none of the three cases does "Authorize_Refund" immediately precede "Update_Inventory." The claim is **false**.
