2. **Send_Closure_Letter**  
   - Avg: 12.2 h | 95th: 44.0 h  
   - Action: Automate template finalization (NLP for missing data) + parallel approval workflows.  

3. **Assess_Liability**  
   - Avg: 7.8 h | 95th: 16.4 h  
   - Action: Deploy ML-driven liability models to auto-approve 60% of low-risk claims (pre-QA filter).
