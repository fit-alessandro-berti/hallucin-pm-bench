Okay, let's start by understanding what the user needs. They want a summary of the decision points in Acme Bank's Micro-loan Fast-Track process and a list of all required documents at submission time. They emphasized using the exact terminology from the process description and avoiding standard loan terms.

First, I need to go through the Micro-loan Fast-Track steps and identify where decisions are made. The decision points are usually indicated by steps that determine whether the application proceeds or not.

Looking at step 5, "Underwriter Alignment Gate" – there's a decision here based on the scores from the two underwriters. If they differ by more than 2 points, it escalates to the Harmonisation Committee. That's the first decision point.

Next, step 7, "Amount Threshold Decision" – this determines whether the loan auto-approves if under €15,000 or goes to the Micro-loan Board if €15,000 or more. That's the second decision point.

So there are two decision points: the Underwriter Alignment Gate and the Amount Threshold Decision.

Now, for the required documents at submission time. The user listed them as a bullet point list. I need to ensure I copy each exactly as stated, without modification:

- Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
- Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
- Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
- Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
- Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)

I should double-check that these match the documents in the original process. Yes, they all are listed under "Required documents at submission time."

I need to make sure not to add any extra information or use different terms. Just a straightforward summary of the decision points and the list of documents.
**Decision Points**:
1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** - Determines if scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤2 points, or if escalation to Harmonisation Committee is needed
2. **Amount Threshold Decision** - Determines if amount is <€15 000 (auto-approve) or ≥€15 000 (proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval)

**Required Documents at Submission Time**:
- Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
- Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
- Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
- Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
- Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)
