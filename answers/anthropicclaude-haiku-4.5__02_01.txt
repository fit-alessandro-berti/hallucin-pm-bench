I'll analyze the event log fragment systematically to answer each question.

**Q1. Distinct case IDs:**
Scanning all events, I find:
- A-9321
- B-1045
- C-77

Count: **3**

**Q2. Activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" in case A-9321:**
Events for case A-9321 in chronological order:
1. 08:02:00 - Receive_Order
2. 08:16:00 - Validate_Order
3. 09:01:00 - Pack_Items
4. 09:20:00 - Ship_Order

The activity immediately before Ship_Order is **Pack_Items**

**Q3. Earliest timestamp:**
Comparing all timestamps:
- 08:02:00 (A-9321, Receive_Order)
- 08:05:00 (B-1045, Receive_Order)
- 08:16:00 (A-9321, Validate_Order)
- 08:17:00 (B-1045, Validate_Order)
- 08:45:00 (B-1045, Quality_Check)
- 09:01:00 (A-9321, Pack_Items)
- 09:10:00 (B-1045, Pack_Items)
- 09:20:00 (A-9321, Ship_Order)
- 09:25:00 (B-1045, Ship_Order)
- 10:00:00 (C-77, Quality_Check)

Earliest: **2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00**

**Q4. Occurrences of "Quality_Check":**
- B-1045 at 08:45:00
- C-77 at 10:00:00

Count: **2**

**Q5. Activities that never appear as the first event of any case:**
First events by case:
- A-9321: Receive_Order
- B-1045: Receive_Order
- C-77: Quality_Check

All activities in the log:
- Receive_Order (appears as first)
- Validate_Order (never first)
- Pack_Items (never first)
- Quality_Check (appears as first)
- Ship_Order (never first)

Never first: **Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Ship_Order**
