No.

Justification:  
In CaseID **C002**, the sequence is:  
– Receive_Order (09:30:00)  
– Pack_Items (09:50:00) ← *intervening activity*  
– Validate_Payment (10:05:00)  

In CaseID **C004**, the sequence is:  
– Receive_Order (10:05:00)  
– Check_Fraud (10:07:00) ← *intervening activity*  
– Validate_Payment (10:20:00)  

Thus, “Validate_Payment” does **not** always occur immediately after “Receive_Order”; other activities sometimes occur in between. The stated FACT is contradicted by the evidence in the log.
