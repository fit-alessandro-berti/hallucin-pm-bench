**No.**

**Justification:**  
The claim that “Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after ‘Receive_Order,’ with no other activities in between” is contradicted by the evidence in the log.

- In **Case C002**, the sequence is:  
  `Receive_Order` → **`Pack_Items`** → `Validate_Payment`  
  Here, **`Pack_Items`** occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, violating the “immediately after” condition.

- In **Case C004**, the sequence is:  
  `Receive_Order` → **`Check_Fraud`** → `Validate_Payment`  
  Here, **`Check_Fraud`** occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, again violating the condition.

Thus, in both Case C002 and Case C004, activities other than “Validate_Payment” occur immediately after “Receive_Order,” disproving the stated FACT.
