No.

Justification:

1. **Rule 1 Violation**: The order of reviews is incorrect. `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) should occur before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), but in the trace, QE occurs before RA, which satisfies this rule.

2. **Rule 2 Violation**: `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen after both QE and RA. In the trace, VP occurs after RA, which satisfies this rule.

3. **Rule 3 Violation**: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until after both QE and RA are complete. In the trace, NA occurs after QE but before RA, violating this rule.

4. **Rule 4 Satisfaction**: `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after both NA and VP, which satisfies this rule given the other conditions are met.

Since Rule 3 is violated, the trace is not compliant with ruleset R.
