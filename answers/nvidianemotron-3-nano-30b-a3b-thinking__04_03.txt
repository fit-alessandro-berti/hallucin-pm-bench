**Answer: No**

- **Rule 1:** QE occurs before RA → satisfied.  
- **Rule 2:** VP occurs after both QE and RA (severity = “High”) → satisfied.  
- **Rule 3:** NA must not occur until after **both** QE **and** RA are complete → **violated** (NA appears before RA).  
- **Rule 4:** CC occurs after NA (and after VP) → satisfied.

Because Rule 3 is violated, the trace is non‑compliant.
