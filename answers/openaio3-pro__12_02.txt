In case C003, Validate_Payment occurs first (line 6, 10:43) and the corresponding Receive_Order comes only later at 10:45 (line 7), so the activity does **not** follow Receive_Order.  In case C005, a Validate_Payment appears (line 11) but the log contains no Receive_Order for that case at all.  These two counter-examples show that Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order in the fragment.
