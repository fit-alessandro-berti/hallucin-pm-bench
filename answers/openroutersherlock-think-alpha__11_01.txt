The three worst by average waiting time:  

1. **Request_Documents** (Avg: 36.5h, 95th%: 120.0h): Deploy automated reminders to claimants at 24h/72h intervals, addressing long-tail delays to cut avg wait ≥25% (to ≤27.4h).  

2. **Send_Closure_Letter** (Avg: 12.2h, 95th%: 44.0h): Automate digital notifications (email/SMS), eliminating manual queues to reduce avg ≥30% (to ≤8.5h).  

3. **Assess_Liability** (Avg: 7.8h, 95th%: 16.4h): Prioritize low-risk cases via rules-based routing, leveraging wait variance to cut avg ≥25% (to ≤5.9h).
