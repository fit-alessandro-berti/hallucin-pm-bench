Based on the 18 log lines provided:

1. **1** time.  
   (Only line 7 contains the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check”.)

2. **5.56 %**  
   Calculation: 1 occurrence ÷ 18 total events = 0.0555… → 5.56 % when rounded to two decimal places.

3. **A1002**  
   (Only case A1002 includes this activity.)

4. Two sampling‑related reasons the monthly estimate is unreliable:  
   * **Limited temporal coverage** – the fragment contains data from only a single calendar day (2025‑05‑01), so it cannot capture day‑of‑week variation, weekly cycles, or other monthly trends that affect fraud‑check frequency.  
   * **Small sample size** – with only four cases (and one fraud check) in the fragment, the observed proportion has high variance and low statistical power, making extrapolation to an entire month unstable.
