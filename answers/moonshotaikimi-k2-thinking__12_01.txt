**No, the fact is not accurate.**

* **Case 1001**: *Update_Inventory* (08:25:55) occurs **before** *Authorize_Refund* (08:30:02).  
* **Case 1002**: There is **no** *Update_Inventory* activity at all, so *Authorize_Refund* cannot be immediately before it.  
* **Case 1003**: *Update_Inventory* (10:08:07) occurs **before** *Authorize_Refund* (10:22:18), with *Quality_Check* in between.

Thus, *Authorize_Refund* does **not** always occur immediately before *Update_Inventory*.
