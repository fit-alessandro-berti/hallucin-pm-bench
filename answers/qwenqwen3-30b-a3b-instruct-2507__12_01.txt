No, the fact is not accurate.

In case ID 1003:  
- "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 10:22:18  
- "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07 (earlier in time)

Thus, "Authorize_Refund" does not occur immediately before "Update_Inventory" in case 1003; in fact, "Update_Inventory" precedes "Authorize_Refund".

This contradicts the claim that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case.
