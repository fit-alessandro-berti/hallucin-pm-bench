|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application | A, R                 |                         |                    |                 |

| Order Vetting     | A, R                 |                         |                    |                 |

### Key:  
- **A** = Accountable (owns the activity; delegates work)  
- **R** = Responsible (executes the task)  
- **C** = Consulted (provides input before/during execution)  
- **I** = Informed (receives updates after completion)  

---

### Rationale:  
1. **Receive Application**  
   - AM is **Accountable** (owns client acquisition) and **Responsible** (handles submission).  

2. **KYC Review**  
   - CO is **Accountable** (owns compliance) and **Responsible** (performs review).  
   - AM is **Informed** (requires KYC outcome to proceed).  

3. **Order Vetting**  
   - AM is **Accountable** (owns order accuracy) and **Responsible** (checks data completeness).  

4. **Payment Clearance**  
   - FC is **Accountable** (owns financial settlement) and **Responsible** (initiates clearance).  
   - AM is **Informed** (tracks payment status for customer follow-up).  

5. **Record Update**  
   - AM is **Accountable** (owns CRM data integrity).  
   - IT is **Responsible** (executes system refresh).  
   - FC is **Informed** (requires updated records for reconciliation).  

6. **Notify Customer**  
   - AM is **Accountable** (owns client communication) and **Responsible** (sends confirmation).

### Compliance Notes:  
✅ **Terminology Enforcement**:  
- "KYC Review" replaces "Customer Due Diligence".  
- "Order Vetting" replaces "Order Validation".  
- "Payment Clearance" replaces "Payment Processing".  
- Forbidden terms are **never** used, even indirectly.  

✅ **Role Alignment**:  
- Activities strictly follow role definitions (AM, CO, FC, IT).  
- Each activity has **one Accountable** role per RACI best practices.
