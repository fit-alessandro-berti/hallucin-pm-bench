**Question 1:** Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking.

**Question 2:** Minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.  
- After T1: P1 and P2 are produced.  
- T2 consumes P1, producing P3.  
- T7 consumes P3, producing P4.  
- T4 consumes P4, producing P5.  
- T5 then fires with P2 and P5, before T3 has fired (T3 remains unfired).  
This sequence (length 5) demonstrates T5 firing without T3 occurring, as P2 is used by T5 instead of T3.
