**Answer to Question 1:** Yes.  
**Bonus Answer:** A minimal sequence is T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5. After T1, T2 consumes P1 to create P3. T7 then moves P3 to P4. T4 moves P4 to P5. At this point, P2 (from T1) and P5 (from T4) are both present, allowing T5 to fire before T3.  

**Explanation:** T5 requires P2 and P5. By firing T2 and T7 first, P5 is generated without consuming P2, enabling T5 to fire before T3.
