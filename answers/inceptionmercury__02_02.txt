Okay, I can analyze the provided XES event log fragment to answer your questions.

**Q1. How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

There are 3 distinct cases present in this fragment: C001, C002, and C003.

**Q2. For case ““C002” list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

The sequence of activities for case "C002" is:

Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

**Q3. Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:

Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
