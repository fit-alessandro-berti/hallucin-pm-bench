**No**

Justification:
1. **Violated** – QE and RA must occur **in that order**; here RA happens **after** NA.
2. **Satisfied** – severity = "High" and VP occurs after both QE and RA (although RA is out of place, the eventual order still meets the “after both” requirement).
3. **Violated** – NA occurs **before** RA is complete.
4. **Violated** – CC occurs before NA is complete (NA is still pending when CC is executed).
