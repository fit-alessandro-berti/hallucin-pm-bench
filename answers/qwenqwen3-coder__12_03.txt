**Answer:** No

**Justification:**  
The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," with no other activities in between.

However, examining the event logs:

- In **Case C004**:  
  - Receive_Order occurs at 10:05:00  
  - Check_Fraud occurs at 10:07:00  
  - Validate_Payment occurs at 10:20:00  

This shows that **Check_Fraud** occurs between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, which directly contradicts the FACT.

Therefore, the FACT is **not accurate** with respect to the event log excerpt.
