**Non-compliant**

Justification:
1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), which requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. However, `Risk_Assessment` (event #9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` (event #8).
2. **Rule 4 violation**: The activity `Move_to_Quality` (event #7) is executed by an **Intern** and **directly follows** `Goods_Received` (event #6), which is executed by a **Warehouse_Clerk** (not the CFO in this case, but the rule prohibits any activity by an Intern from directly following an activity by the CFO, which is not violated hereâ€”this part is compliant). However, the primary violation is Rule 2.

*(Note: The trace is compliant with Rules 1, 3, and 5. Rule 4 is not violated in this trace because no activity by an Intern follows an activity by the CFO.)*

**Correction**: The primary violation is Rule 2. The trace is **Non-compliant** due to the `Risk_Assessment` timing issue.

**Final Answer**: Non-compliant (Rule 2).
