We begin with the initial marking:
  p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0).

A possible concrete sequence is:

1. Fire T1: p0 → p1 + p2
  New marking: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0).

2. Fire T2: p1 → p3
  New marking: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0).

3. Fire T5: p3 –|p4 → p6
  Preconditions for T5:
   – There is a token in p3 (from T2).
   – p4 has zero tokens (since T3 has not yet fired).
  Thus, T5 is enabled and fires.
  New marking after T5: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1).

Notice that T3 has not fired yet (its firing would put a token in p4) and therefore did not interfere with the inhibitor condition on T5.

Justification:
• T5 is enabled when p3 has a token and p4 is empty. After firing T1 and T2, p3 is marked while p4 remains empty since T3 (which would produce a token in p4) has not been executed.
• Therefore, the sequence T1, then T2, then T5 shows that T5 can indeed fire before T3.

So, the answer is: Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3.
