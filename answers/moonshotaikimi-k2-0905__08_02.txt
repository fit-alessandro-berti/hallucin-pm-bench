Answer 1: Yes.  
T3 only needs P2, but T5 needs both P2 and P5; P5 can only be produced after T4 has fired, and T4 can fire as soon as P4 contains a token. The token in P4 may arrive via T7 (bypassing T3), so P5 can be created while P2 still holds its initial token. Hence T5 can fire before T3 ever fires.

Answer 2 (bonus):  
T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5
