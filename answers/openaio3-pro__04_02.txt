R1  Compliant – Manager_Approval precedes Finance_Approval for PO amount €12 450, satisfying sequence requirement.  
R2  Violated – Expedited order shipped before new mandatory Manager re-approval, hence not after the last required approval.  
R3  Violated – Pay_Invoice (06 Mar) occurs before Receive_Goods (07 Mar), which is disallowed.  
R4  Not Applicable – hazardous flag is false, so Safety_Inspection rule does not apply.  
R5  Violated – Change_Request followed by Ship_Goods without prior new Manager_Approval breaches rule.  
R6  Compliant – Trace terminates with Archive_Record event.

Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT
