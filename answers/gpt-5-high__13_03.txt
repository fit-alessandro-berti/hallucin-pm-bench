- The excerpt covers only 3 cases over ~1.75 hours on 2025-03-01, a tiny, time-limited slice of the month.
- Label variation exists: both “Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)” appear, and there’s also a distinct manual-labeled activity, “Manual Review.” Counting only the exact “Manual Fraud Check” string ignores such events.
- Activities can repeat within a case (“Send Offer” and “Approve Application” appear twice), so event frequency can differ from case-level prevalence.
