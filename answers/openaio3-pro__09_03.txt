Computation is impossible because the event log contains only column headers and no actual rows; therefore no start_time or complete_time values exist for any “Approve Invoice” events. Without those timestamps (or even the count of such events) the average cycle time, its standard deviation, and the 95 % confidence interval cannot be derived.
