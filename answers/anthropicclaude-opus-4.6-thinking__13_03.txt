### 1️⃣ Exact count of "Manual Fraud Check"

**1 occurrence** — in Case 1002, at 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z. No other row contains that exact string.

### 2️⃣ Why this snippet can mislead about true frequency (≤ 120 words)

* **Tiny sample size.** Three cases out of an entire month cannot reliably represent the true proportion of manual fraud checks. One occurrence in three cases (≈ 33 %) could over- or under-state reality.

* **Inconsistent activity labels.** The automatic path alone appears under two different strings — *"Automatic Fraud Check"* (Case 1001) and *"Fraud Check (Automatic)"* (Case 1003). If similar label variants exist for the manual check (e.g., *"Fraud Check (Manual)"*), a simple string-match would under-count them.

* **Selection bias.** We don't know how this excerpt was sampled. If cases were cherry-picked (e.g., one per path variant), the observed ratio is artificial, not representative of the full March 2025 population.
