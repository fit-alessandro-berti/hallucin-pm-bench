The claim that in GalaxyRetail's returns process, the activity "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case is not accurate according to the provided event-log fragment.

Justification:
- In Case 1001, the sequence is as follows: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund. Here, "Update_Inventory" occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund", not after.
- In Case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all.
- In Case 1003, the sequence is: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund. Here again, "Update_Inventory" occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund."

Thus, the statement in the claim is incorrect based on the provided data (Cases 1001 and 1003 demonstrate that "Authorize_Refund" does not immediately precede "Update_Inventory", and Case 1002 does not include an "Update_Inventory").
