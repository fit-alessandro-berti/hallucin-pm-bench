The systems require immediate attention. Three activities fall below SLA thresholds: Credit Assessment, Legal Approval, and Fund Disbursement. Credit Assessment exceeds its SLA by 240, Legal Approval falls 45, and Fund Disbursement lags 35. These discrepancies directly impact customer trust and operational efficiency. The recommended actions are to recalibrate Credit Assessment workflows, enforce stricter deadlines for Legal Approval, and implement faster payment triggers for Fund Disbursement.
