Analysis of throughput data identifies three critical bottlenecks where SLA breaches correlate with high waiting times.

**Legal Approval** shows the largest deviation, averaging 900 seconds against a 600-second target (a 300-second breach). It suffers the highest waiting time of 600 seconds.
*   **Recommendation:** Assign additional resources to the intake queue to eliminate the 600-second waiting delay.

**Risk Review** fails its 300-second target by 300 seconds, averaging 600 seconds total. This delay is driven primarily by 480 seconds of waiting.
*   **Recommendation:** Streamline handover protocols to reduce the 480-second waiting period.

**Credit Assessment** exceeds its 240-second target by 60 seconds. With 200 seconds of waiting per case, queuing delays significantly impact throughput.
*   **Recommendation:** Re-prioritize Credit Assessment tasks to reduce the 200-second wait.

Immediate intervention in these activities is required to meet service level agreements.
