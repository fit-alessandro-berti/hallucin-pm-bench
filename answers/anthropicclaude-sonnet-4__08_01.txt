Looking at this Petri net, I need to determine if T5 can fire before T3 from the initial marking.

Let me trace through the possible firing sequences:

**Initial marking:** p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

**Step 1:** Only T1 is enabled (p0 has a token)
- Fire T1: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

**Step 2:** Now T2 and T3 are enabled
- If I fire T2: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

**Step 3:** Check if T5 can fire before T3
For T5 to be enabled, I need:
- p3 has at least 1 token ✓ (we have 1 token in p3)
- p4 has 0 tokens ✓ (p4 is empty due to inhibitor arc)

T5 is enabled! I can fire T5 before firing T3.

**Concrete firing sequence:**
1. T1: p0(1)→p0(0), p1(1), p2(1)
2. T2: p1(1)→p1(0), p3(1)  
3. T5: p3(1)→p3(0), p6(1) [fires before T3]

**Answer: YES**

**Justification:** After firing T1 then T2, we have a token in p3 and p4 remains empty. This satisfies T5's firing conditions (token in p3, inhibitor arc satisfied by empty p4), allowing T5 to fire before T3 ever fires.
