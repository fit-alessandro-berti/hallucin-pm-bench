I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity from the supplied information.

**Precise reason:** The event log (Artefact A) contains only the column headers with all actual data rows explicitly redacted and removed for privacy. To calculate cycle time for "Approve Invoice," I would need access to the actual timestamp values (start_time and complete_time columns) for rows where the activity column contains "Approve Invoice." Without any actual data points—only knowing that these columns exist in the dataset structure—no statistical calculations are mathematically possible. The Corporate SLA Catalogue provides historical averages for a different time span (Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice = 7.8 days) but contains no data about the cycle time of the "Approve Invoice" activity itself.
