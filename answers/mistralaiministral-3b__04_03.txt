**Answer: No**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1** is violated because `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occurs after `Notify_Authorities` (NA) instead of before it.
2. **Rule 3** is violated because `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA).

Since both Rule 1 and Rule 3 are violated, the trace does not comply with the recall-handling ruleset R.
