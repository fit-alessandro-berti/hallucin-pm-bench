**Contoso Airlines Flight-Refund Process – Decision Points & Required Documents**

| Decision Point | Description | Required Documents |
|----------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** | The triage agent reviews the submitted *RefundRequestForm* against the *FlightManifest* and the *WeatherReport* to determine if the claim is eligible for a refund. | • RefundRequestForm (online submission) <br>• FlightManifest (flight details) <br>• WeatherReport (relevant weather conditions) |
| **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** | The finance controller signs off on the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist* to ensure compliance with internal policies. | • EligibilityChecklist (internal policy checklist) <br>• Completed RefundRequestForm (as validated) <br>• FlightManifest (for reference) <br>• WeatherReport (for reference) |
| **Senior_Auditor_Review** *(only for high‑value claims)* | For refunds exceeding **€1,000**, a senior auditor reviews the case, examining the *AuditTrail* to confirm accuracy and compliance. | • AuditTrail (full audit log of the claim process) <br>• Completed RefundRequestForm (validated) <br>• FlightManifest (for reference) <br>• WeatherReport (for reference) <br>• BankTransferAuthorization (if payment is to be initiated) |
| **Process_Refund_Payment** | The finance team executes the refund payment once the *BankTransferAuthorization* is present. This step can only commence after successful completion of **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** and, for high‑value claims, **Senior_Auditor_Review**. | • BankTransferAuthorization (signed authorization for payment) <br>• Completed RefundRequestForm (final) <br>• EligibilityChecklist (final) <br>• Senior_Auditor_Review (if applicable) |
| **Issue_Confirmation_Letter** | A *RefundConfirmationPDF* is generated and emailed to the passenger, confirming the refund details. | • RefundConfirmationPDF (automatically generated) <br>• All previously approved documents (for audit/reference) |

**Summary:**  
Contoso Airlines’ refund process includes four primary decision points: eligibility validation by a triage agent, finance controller pre‑approval, (optional) senior auditor review for high‑value refunds, and final payment execution. Each decision point is tied to specific required documents, ensuring that only eligible claims proceed to payment. The legacy “CustomerService_Agent_Decide” activity is not part of this process.
