1. Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?
- 1

2. What percentage of all logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)

3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.
- A1002

4. Two sampling-related reasons why using only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable:
- Very small sample size / rare-event instability: the fragment contains only 18 events and a single occurrence of Manual_Fraud_Check, so the estimate has very high sampling variability and large relative error for extrapolation to a month.
- Non-representative temporal coverage (temporal sampling bias): the fragment covers a single day (2025-05-01) only; it may not reflect typical daily/weekly/monthly patterns or special-day effects, so it is not a random or representative sample of the month.
