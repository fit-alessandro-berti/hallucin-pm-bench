1️⃣ The exact activity "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1 time** (in Case 1002).  

2️⃣ Analysts might misestimate manual fraud check frequency because:  
- This snippet covers only **3 cases** and **1 day** of data, not the full month.  
- Variations in activity names exist (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), suggesting inconsistent labeling that could exist elsewhere.  
- **Manual Fraud Check** might correlate with specific, time-bound fraud patterns (e.g., spikes later in the month) not visible here.  
- Case 1002 required a manual review before the fraud check, implying manual checks could depend on hidden business rules not evidenced in this limited sample.
