The user wants a BPMN 2.0 XML representation of a specific process described in 10 lines.
Constraints:
1.  **Exact Translation:** Do not invent/add elements not mentioned.
2.  **XML Format:** Single `<definitions> ... </definitions>` block.
3.  **Line Limit:** ≤ 40 lines.
4.  **IDs:** Concise (e.g., `t1`, `gw1`).
5.  **Gateways:** Mark decision points with **exclusive gateways**.
6.  **Loop:** Model the re-work loop exactly as line 9 describes.
7.  **No Diagram Elements:** No `<bpmndi: ...>` blocks.

**Process Analysis:**
1.  Start: Customer submits ticket. (Start Event)
2.  Activity: Ticket automatically classified. (Task)
3.  Decision 1: If "Password Reset" -> "Provide Reset Instructions". (Exclusive Gateway)
4.  Else: Support agent performs "Initial Diagnosis". (Task)
5.  Decision 2: After diagnosis, "Resolve Issue" OR "Forward to Specialist". (Exclusive Gateway)
6.  Activity: Specialist finishes -> "Resolve Issue". (Task)
7.  Activity: Once resolved -> "Confirm with Customer". (Task)
8.  Decision 3: If customer confirms -> Close. (Exclusive Gateway)
9.  Decision 3 (cont.): If persists -> Loop back to "Initial Diagnosis". (Sequence Flow)
10. End: Ticket closed. (End Event)

**Constraint Conflict:**
The text describes **three** logical branching points (Classification, Diagnosis Outcome, Confirmation).
The instruction says "Mark the **two** decision points with exclusive gateways".
This is a contradiction. "Exactly as stated" (Line 3, 5, 8/9) implies 3 gateways. "Mark the two" implies 2.
Given "Translate it into BPMN 2.0 XML exactly as stated" is the primary task instruction, and "Do not invent or add... that are not mentioned", removing a logical branch violates "Exactly as stated".
However, "Mark the two decision points" is a specific constraint on the output structure.
To satisfy both as best as possible: I will implement the logic described (3 gateways) because omitting a branch makes the process incorrect according to the text. The "two" might be a counting error in the prompt (3 logical points vs 2 explicit "If" keywords in some interpretations, though Line 5 says "either/or").
Wait, I can try to merge the Classification logic? No.
I will prioritize the logical correctness (3 gateways) to ensure the process works as described, as "Exactly as stated" is the core directive. I will keep the XML compact to meet the 40-line limit.
Actually, looking closely at "Mark the two decision points". If I use 3, I technically violate this.
Is there a way to interpret the text as having only 2?
Maybe "Classify" is not a decision point (it's a task)? But it branches.
Maybe "Confirm" is not a decision point? But it branches.
Maybe "Diagnosis" outcome is not a decision point? But it says "either... or".
I will use 3 gateways. It is the only way to represent the text accurately. I will ensure the line count is low.

**Drafting XML:**
- Use compact tags (single line for multiple flows if needed).
- IDs: `se1`, `t1`... `gw1`... `ee1`.
- Gateways: `gw1` (Classify), `gw2` (Diagnosis), `gw3` (Confirm).
- Loops: `gw3` -> `t3` (Diagnosis).

**Line Count Check:**
Definitions header (1)
Process start (1)
StartEvent (1)
Tasks (5: Classify, Reset, Diag, Resolve, Specialist, Confirm) -> 6 tasks.
Gateways (3).
EndEvent (1).
SequenceFlows (approx 13).
Process end (1).
Definitions end (1).
Total approx 25-30 lines. Safe.

**Refining "Two Decision Points":**
If I *must* use two gateways to satisfy the constraint strictly:
I could model the Classification as a Task that doesn't branch (violates Line 3).
I could model the Confirmation loop as a Boundary Event (violates "Exclusive Gateway" instruction for decision points).
I will stick with 3 gateways for accuracy. The instruction "Mark the two decision points" is likely a prompt error given the text has 3 clear branches. I will prioritize the text description.
*Self-Correction:* Actually, if I want to be very strict on "Mark the two decision points", I should look for which ones are explicitly "decision points".
Line 3: "If... Otherwise..." (Decision)
Line 5: "either... or..." (Decision)
Line 8/9: "If... If..." (Decision)
Okay, I'll use 3. It's better to be logically correct than to follow a likely erroneous count constraint when the text is explicit.
Wait, I can check if I can combine GW1 and GW2? No.
I will use 3 gateways.

**Wait, I need to check the line count constraint again.**
≤ 40 lines.
I will write compact XML.

**Final Plan:**
1.  XML Declaration.
2.  Definitions.
3.  Process.
4.  Start Event.
5.  Task: Classify.
6.  Gateway: GW1 (Classify).
7.  Task: Reset.
8.  Task: Diagnosis.
9.  Gateway: GW2 (Diagnosis).
10. Task: Resolve.
11. Task: Specialist.
12. Gateway: GW3 (Confirm).
13. Task: Confirm.
14. End Event.
15. Sequence Flows (Compact).
16. Close Process/Definitions.

Let's count lines in the final output generation. I will combine sequence flows on single lines to save space.

One more check on "Two Decision Points".
If I assume the prompt considers "Classification" as automated (not a decision point) and "Diagnosis Outcome" and "Confirmation" as the two decision points.
But Line 3 says "If...".
I will use 3 gateways.

Wait, I'll try to fit the "Two Decision Points" constraint by merging the "Classification" logic into the "Diagnosis" task? No.
Okay, I'll use 3 gateways.

Wait, I'll check the line limit again.
I will write the XML now```xml
