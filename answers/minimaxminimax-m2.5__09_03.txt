It is not possible to calculate the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95 % confidence interval for the “Approve Invoice” activity because the supplied event‑log stub contains only column names – all rows, timestamps, and case identifiers have been redacted. The SLA catalogue provides a historical average for the interval between “Approve Invoice” and “Pay Invoice,” but it does not give the actual start and complete times of the “Approve Invoice” activity in the log, which are required for the requested metrics.
