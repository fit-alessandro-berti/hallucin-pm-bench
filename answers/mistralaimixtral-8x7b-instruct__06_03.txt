Sure, I can help you with that. In Process B - Warehouse_Replenishment, there are two sets of tasks that can execute concurrently:

1. **Quality_Check** and **Update_Inventory** in the first parallel construct (Parallel Split #1). These tasks are independent of each other and can be executed at the same time.

2. **Generate_Replenishment_Report** and **Notify_Procurement** in the second parallel construct (Parallel Split #2). These tasks are also independent of each other and can be executed simultaneously.

So, the list of concurrent task sets in Process B is:

1. Quality_Check and Update_Inventory
2. Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement

These tasks can be executed concurrently because they are on different branches of the same parallel construct in the process model.
