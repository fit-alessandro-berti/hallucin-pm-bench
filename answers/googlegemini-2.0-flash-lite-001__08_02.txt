**Question 1: No.**

T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5 to fire. P2 can only receive a token from T1. P5 can only receive a token from T4. T4 must fire after T3 and after T2. T3 must follow T1, and T2 must follow T1. Therefore, T5 can fire *only* after T3 *and* T4.

**Question 2 (bonus):** No. The reason is given in the answer to Question 1. T5 needs a token in both P2 and P5.
