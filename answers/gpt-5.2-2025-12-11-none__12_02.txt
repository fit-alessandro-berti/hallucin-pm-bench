In case **C003**, **Validate_Payment** occurs at line **6** (10:43) and **Receive_Order** occurs later at line **7** (10:45), so **Validate_Payment** does **not** always follow **Receive_Order**; additionally, case **C005** has **Validate_Payment** at line **11** with no **Receive_Order** shown for that case in the fragment.
