Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2 violated:** Because `Expedite_Flag` occurs (#4), `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` is at **#8**, but `Risk_Assessment` occurs at **#9** (after shipping).  
2. **Rule 3 violated:** After `Goods_Received` (**#6**), `Three_way_match` must be completed within the **next two activities**. The next two activities are **#7** and **#8**, but `Three_way_match` occurs at **#10** (more than 2 activities later).
