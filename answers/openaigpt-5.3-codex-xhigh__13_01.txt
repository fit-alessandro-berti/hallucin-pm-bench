1. **“Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs exactly 1 time** in this fragment.

2. Percentage of all logged events:
\[
\frac{1}{18}\times 100 = 5.56\%
\]
So it represents **5.56%** of events (rounded to two decimals).

3. Case(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”:
- **A1002**

4. Two sampling-related reasons a monthly estimate would be unreliable:
- **Very small sample**: only **18 events across 4 cases**, with just one fraud-check event, so the estimate has high variance.
- **Poor temporal/selection coverage**: this is only a **fragment** from a short window on **one date** (2025-05-01), and the extraction method is unknown, so it may not be representative of a full month.
