**Executive Memo: Analysis of Process Performance Bottlenecks**

From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst

Our loan application process analysis reveals significant performance issues in key activities, based on the provided throughput and waiting time data for 1200 cases. The three worst-performing activities, evaluated jointly on SLA breaches (where average throughput time exceeds target SLA) and high waiting times, are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.  

Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds, with 600 seconds of average waiting time across 465 cases. Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with 480 seconds of average waiting time across 480 cases. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, with 200 seconds of average waiting time across 1175 cases.  

These bottlenecks contribute to overall delays, impacting efficiency. Targeted actions are recommended below:  

- For Legal Approval, allocate additional resources to reduce the 600-second waiting time, as it matches the 300-second SLA excess in 465 cases.  
- For Risk Review, streamline manual checks to address the 480-second waiting time, which is 60% of the 600-second throughput in 480 cases.  
- For Credit Assessment, automate initial scoring to cut the 200-second waiting time, representing 67% of the 300-second throughput in 1175 cases.  

Implementing these will improve compliance and throughput. (148 words)
