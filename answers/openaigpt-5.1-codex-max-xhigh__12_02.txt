No. In case C003 the Validate_Payment occurs at 10:43 (line 6) before the Receive_Order at 10:45 (line 7), so it does not follow it, and case C005 has a Validate_Payment at 12:00 (line 11) with no Receive_Order in that case at all, so the claim that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order is violated.
