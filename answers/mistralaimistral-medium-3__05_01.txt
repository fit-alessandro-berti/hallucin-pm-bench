To enforce the 48-hour SLA, add a **boundary timer event** to the "Check Completeness" task (`Task_Check`) with a 48-hour deadline. If the timer expires, the process should escalate by routing directly to "Triage Claim" (`Task_Triage`) via a new sequence flow, bypassing the "Docs complete?" gateway (`GW_Docs`).

**Implementation steps:**
1. Attach a timer boundary event to `Task_Check` with a 48-hour duration.
2. Connect the timer’s outgoing flow to `Task_Triage` (reusing `f6` or creating a new flow).
3. Ensure the timer’s condition triggers only if the task isn’t completed within 48 hours.

This ensures compliance without adding new tasks.
