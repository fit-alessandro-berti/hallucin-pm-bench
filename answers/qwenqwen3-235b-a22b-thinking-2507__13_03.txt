1️⃣ **"Manual Fraud Check" occurs exactly 1 time.**  
*(Verified: Only CaseID 1002 at 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z matches the exact string.)*  

2️⃣ **Misestimation reasons (≤120 words):**  
This snippet contains only 3 cases over 1.5 hours. An analyst might underestimate manual fraud check frequency because:  
- **Tiny sample size:** Just 3 cases cannot represent a full month’s volume (e.g., manual checks may surge later due to fraud spikes).  
- **Time bias:** All entries are from March 1 morning; patterns may differ later in the month (e.g., weekend fraud trends).  
- **Naming inconsistency:** Activity labels vary (e.g., "Fraud Check (Automatic)" vs. "Automatic Fraud Check"), risking misclassification of manual checks in larger logs.  
- **No rework loops:** The snippet shows linear paths; real logs may have repeated manual checks per case, invisible here.
