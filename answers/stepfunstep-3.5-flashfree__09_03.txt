I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" because the supplied event log (Artefact A) contains no observable data—only column headers with all rows and all timestamp values redacted. Without actual start_time and complete_time values for any cases, no numerical metrics can be derived from the log. The historical average from Artefact B refers to a different interval (from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice") and originates from a separate KPI source, not the supplied log, so it cannot be used to fulfill the task's requirement.
