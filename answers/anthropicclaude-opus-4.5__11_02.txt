### Three Worst-Performing Activities

**1. Request_Documents**
- **Problem:** Severe bottleneck with 150-minute average wait time (8x higher than any other activity) and 22% rework rate—indicating customers repeatedly fail to submit correct documentation.
- **Action:** Implement automated document checklists with real-time validation at submission to reduce rework and queue buildup.

**2. Review_Documents**
- **Problem:** Highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) combined with high processing variability (stdev 9 min) and 5.3% rework. This suggests inconsistent reviewer workload or unclear evaluation criteria.
- **Action:** Standardize review rubrics and deploy workload balancing to reduce variability and breaches.

**3. Initial_Assessment**
- **Problem:** Second-highest wait time (18 min) with 3.2% SLA breaches and elevated rework (1.8%)—creating early-stage delays that cascade downstream.
- **Action:** Add assessment capacity during peak intake periods or introduce triage automation for straightforward cases.

### Summary
These three activities account for the primary throughput losses (280→179 cases/day). Addressing document-related friction and assessment delays should materially improve end-to-end cycle time.
