The fact is inaccurate because in the log fragment, *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order*. For example, in case C003 (lines 6-7), *Validate_Payment* occurs **before** *Receive_Order*, violating the stated claim. Additionally, case C005 (lines 11-12) shows *Validate_Payment* followed by *Cancel_Order* without *Receive_Order* appearing at all, further disproving the "always follows" assertion. The log demonstrates variability in the order of these activities.
