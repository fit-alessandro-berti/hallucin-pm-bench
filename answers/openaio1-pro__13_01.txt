Answer:

1. There is exactly 1 occurrence of “Manual_Fraud_Check” in the log.  
2. That single occurrence represents 1/18 = 5.56% of all logged events (rounded to two decimal places).  
3. It appears only in case A1002.  
4. Two sampling‐related reasons for unreliability:  
   • The fragment contains very few cases from just one date, so the sample size is too small to generalize.  
   • It is not clear whether these cases are representative of the normal monthly process, so the sample may be biased.
