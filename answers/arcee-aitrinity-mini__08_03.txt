Yes. It is possible for T5 to fire before T3. The shortest firing sequence is:

(T1, T2b, T4, T5)

**Explanation:**  
- After the initial marking (p0 = 1), T1 fires first, consuming p0 and producing pa and pb.  
- T2b then fires, consuming pa and producing pd.  
- T4 then fires, consuming pb and producing pe.  
- T5 then fires, consuming pd and pe, and producing pf (while pb is 0).  

In this sequence:  
1. T1 fires to produce pa and pb.  
2. T2b consumes pa to produce pd.  
3. T4 consumes pb to produce pe.  
4. **T5 fires next**, leveraging the available pd (from T2b) and pe (from T4).  

T3 has not fired in this sequence (pc remains 0), but the question only requires T5 to fire before T3, not before T3 fires. The sequence proves T5 can fire before T3 is enabled, as T3 requires pc (which is never produced in this path). This demonstrates non-trivial preemptive potential.  

**Verification Constraint (state is reproducible from provided info):**  
- The sequence relies **solely** on the initial marking and net semantics. No external assumptions are needed.  
- Each transition in the sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) has sufficient input tokens to fire at the stated marking.  

**Termination:**  
The sequence is minimal (4 transitions), and T5 fires third, before T3. There is no shorter sequence (T5 requires both pd and pe, which T2b and T4 provide).
