### Summary:
Changes between BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2:

**Added tasks**
• check_vip
• generate_qr

**Removed tasks**
• send_rma_label

**Gateway type changes**
• gw_valid: type changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway.

For rest of the flow, sequence key flows do have ID switches/propagations when altered (f1-f5 till later etc. seen matching mostly traffic-wise, could be full matrixed but not required under categories herein).
