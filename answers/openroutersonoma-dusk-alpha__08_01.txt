**No**

**Proof:**

T5 requires p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0 (due to the inhibitor arc from p4). 

The only way to reach p3 ≥ 1 is by firing T2, which requires p1 ≥ 1. The only way to reach p1 ≥ 1 is by firing T1 from the initial marking M0 = (1,0,0,0,0,0,0), yielding M1 = (0,1,1,0,0,0,0).

From M1, T5 is not enabled because p4 = 1 ≠ 0. Thus, T5 cannot fire immediately after T1.

The only enabled transitions from M1 are T2 and T3. Firing T3 first yields M2 = (0,1,0,0,1,0,0). From M2, T5 is still not enabled because p3 = 0.

Thus, T5 cannot fire after T1 but before T3. Firing T3 is a prerequisite for enabling T5.
