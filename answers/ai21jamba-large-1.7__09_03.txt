I cannot compute the requested metrics because the provided **Artefact A (Event-Log Stub)** contains no data in the event log. The complete absence of rows and timestamps makes it impossible to calculate the cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval of any activity, including "Approve Invoice." Additionally, while **Artefact B** offers historical averages and SLAs, these are external summaries and cannot replace the actual event data needed for precise metric derivation.
