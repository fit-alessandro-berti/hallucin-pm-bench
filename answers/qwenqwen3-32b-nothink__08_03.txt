We are given a Petri net with the specified structure and an initial marking. The question is whether **T5 can fire before T3** in any reachable marking.

---

### **Net Overview**

**Places:**
- `p0`, `pa`, `pb`, `pc`, `pd`, `pe`, `pf`

**Transitions:**
- `T1`: `p0 → pa, pb`
- `T2`: `pa → pc`
- `T2b`: `pa → pd`
- `T3`: `pc → pd`
- `T4`: `pb → pe`
- `T5`: `pd, pe → pf`
- `T6`: `pf → pc`

**Initial marking:**
- `p0 = 1`  
- all other places `= 0`

---

### **Goal**

Determine **if T5 can fire before T3**, i.e., whether there is a **reachable marking** in which **T5 is enabled and T3 is not yet enabled**, and then T5 fires **before** any opportunity for T3 to fire.

Let’s explore the **possible firing sequences** from the initial marking.

---

### **Step 1: T1 fires (initial)**

- **Initial marking:** `p0 = 1`
- **After T1:** `p0 = 0`, `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`

So now the tokens are in `pa` and `pb`.

---

### **Step 2: Consider possible paths from here**

From this point, we can consider which transitions are enabled:

- `T2`: enabled from `pa`
- `T2b`: enabled from `pa`
- `T4`: enabled from `pb`

Let’s analyze **two cases**:

---

## **Case A: T2 fires (pa → pc), then T3 (pc → pd)**

1. `T1` → `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`
2. `T2` → `pa = 0`, `pc = 1`
3. `T4` → `pb = 0`, `pe = 1`
4. Then T3 can fire: `pc = 1 → pd = 1`

Now `pd = 1`, `pe = 1` → **T5 is enabled**, and can fire to produce `pf`.

So: `T5` fires after `T3`.

---

## **Case B: T2b fires (pa → pd), skip T2 and T3, then try T5 before T3**

This is the case that may allow **T5 to fire before T3**.

1. `T1` → `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`
2. `T2b` → `pa = 0`, `pd = 1`
3. `T4` → `pb = 0`, `pe = 1`  
   → Now: `pd = 1`, `pe = 1` → **T5 is enabled**, so it can fire:
4. `T5` → `pd = 0`, `pe = 0`, `pf = 1`
5. `T6` (optional, not needed for our purpose)

At this point, we have **not yet executed T3**, because its input `pc` is still 0. So **T3 is not enabled** at this time.

Hence, **T5 fired before T3**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion: YES, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.**

---

### **Shortest Firing Sequence where T5 fires before T3:**

1. `T1`  
2. `T2b`  
3. `T4`  
4. `T5`

**Sequence:**  
**`T1, T2b, T4, T5`**

- After these fires, T3 is **not yet enabled** (`pc = 0`), but T5 has already fired.

✅ **Shortest such sequence is of length 4.**
