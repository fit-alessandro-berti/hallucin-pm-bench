To determine the tasks executing concurrently in Process B, I examined the process description and focused only on the parallel blocks explicitly indicated.

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
   *(Parallel Block P1)*  
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
   *(Parallel Block P2, starting after P1 completes)*  
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware  
   *(Parallel Block P3, following glue and clamping)*

No other tasks are noted as running concurrently. Tasks such as "Dry_Fit_Assembly" must run sequentially after the preceding block completes.
