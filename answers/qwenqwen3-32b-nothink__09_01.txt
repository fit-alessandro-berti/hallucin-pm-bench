1) **The average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the provided data.**

2) **Explanation:**  
The event log provides the sequence of activities and the resources involved, but it does **not include timestamps or elapsed-time fields**, which are necessary to calculate the duration of the "Review Contract" activity. Without knowing how long each instance of "Review Contract" took, it is not possible to compute the average cycle time for this activity.
