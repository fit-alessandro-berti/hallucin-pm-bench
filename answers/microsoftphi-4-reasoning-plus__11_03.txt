We are Phi. The conversation says:
System: "You are Orion Credit’s senior process-performance analyst. Ground every sentence in the data supplied; do NOT invent activities or metrics." then user states table: columns: Activity, Avg_Throughput_Time[s], Avg_Waiting_Time[s], Cases, Target_SLA[s] with relevant metrics:

Row: 
Activity: 'Receive Application', Avg_Throughput_Time: 45, Avg_Waiting_Time: 10, Cases: 1200, Target_SLA: 60.
Activity: 'Verify Identity' with values: 120,80,1180,90.
Activity: 'Credit Assessment' with 300,200,1175,240.
Activity: 'Risk Review' with 600,480,480,300.
Activity: 'Draft Offer' with 240,30,470,300.
Activity: 'Legal Approval' with 900,600,465,600.
Activity: 'Customer Acceptance' with 180,15,460,300.
Activity: 'Fund Disbursement' with 60,50,455,120.

Our task is: "only mention the three worst-performing activities based *jointly* on SLA breaches and high waiting time, quantify by how much each activity exceeds its SLA, and single recommendation for each activity. In particular, use bullet points only for recommendations."

Important: "DSL: Identify activities based on SLA breaches and high waiting time." "Three worst-performing" require using the data from table columns. Our provided data columns:
Activity: name.
Avg_Throughput_Time. 
Avg_Waiting_Time.
Cases.
Target_SLA.

We have "SLA breach" maybe occurs if the procedure's throughput time exceed the target SLA. So check: For each row, we have: Avg_Throughput_time, if it is greater than target SLA then it is SLA breach. Note the phrase "does not provide data on omitted columns, likely Extra than just that table.

Analyzing table each row:
Row "Receive Application": Throughput time 45, Target_SLA 60, no breach because 45 < 60, waiting time: 10.
Row "Verify Identity": Throughput time 120, target 90, breach exceeding by (120 - 90 = 30 s extra), waiting time: 80
Row "Credit Assessment": Throughput time 300, target SLA is 240, breach exceeding by 300 - 240 = 60
Row "Risk Review": Throughput time 600, target SLA 300, breach exceeding by 600 - 300 = 300.
Row "Draft Offer": Throughput time 240, target SLA 300, so no SLA breach because below target, clearly better, waiting time: 30.
Row "Legal Approval": Throughput time 900, target SLA 600, breach exceeding by 900 - 600 = 300, waiting time: 600
Row "Customer Acceptance": Throughput time 180, target 300, no breach, waiting time: 15.
Row "Fund Disbursement": Throughput 60, target 120, no breach - very good since below target (60 < 120, waiting: 50)

So the ones that "breached" SLA are: "Verify Identity", "Credit Assessment", "Risk Review", "Legal Approval". But also "Risk Review" has extra after SLA, whose breach magnitude is 600-300 = 300. "Legal Approval" is also 300. "Credit Assessment" breach is 60 difference. "Verify Identity" is 30 difference.

But also "jointly on high waiting time" requirement. "Waiting times": given row numbers are:
"Receive Application": 10,
"Verify Identity": waiting = 80 (highest among acceptable entries), but that might be high. "Credit Assessment": waiting time is 200, maybe high. "Risk Review": waiting time is 480, highest waiting time. "Draft Offer": waiting time of 30, short. "Legal Approval": waiting time of 600, again high waiting time. "Customer Acceptance": 15 waiting time, "Fund Disbursement": 50 waiting time.

We have those four abused rows but also we need to pick three worst performing. The ones that have worst performing metrics due to SLA breach and high waiting time. So which ones? The three worst among them: Use also waiting time as metric. The row has "Risk Review": high through processing 600 s, SLA excess 300 seconds and waiting time 480, worst waiting time. "Legal Approval": 900 s, SLA excess 300, waiting time 600 (highest waiting time). "Credit Assessment": 300, breach is 60, waiting 200. "Verify Identity": 120, breach is 30, waiting 80.

Looking at waiting times: "Risk Review": 480 s, "Legal Approval": 600 s, "Credit Assessment": 200 s, "Verify Identity":80 s. Also "Customer Acceptance" is 180, but though it's breaching? Actually "Customer Acceptance" does not breach because throughput time is 180, and target SLA is 300. So "Legal_approval" is best candidate as worst, then "Risk Review", then "Credit Assessment" or "Verify Identity"? We need a joint measure probably either each activity's sum of failure amounts or something. The instructions say: "jointly" smallest things: The three worst-performing activities based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times. So my guess I pick: "Legal Approval", "Risk Review", and either "Credit Assessment" or "Verify Identity." If I consider worst performing, one should be "Legal Approval" because in the table: "Legal Approval" is not even provided, but then "Fund Disbursement: Cases 455, but obviously they are below specs. "Risk Review" also high waiting time relative to others, but "Legal Approval" waiting time is 600 while "Risk Review" waiting time is 480, and "Plan a concrete data-driven action" for each. But which one is worst? Check metrics: For Legal Approval: Average throughput time = 900 s, Target SLA = 600, so breach = 300. waiting time is 600 s. For Risk Review: 600 s throughput, Target SLA 300, breach = 300, waiting time = 480 s. For Credit Assessment: 300 s throughput compared to target 240, breach = 60, waiting time is 200 s. For Verify Identity: 120 vs target 90, breach = 30 s, waiting time = 80 s. 
Then additional waiting time numbers: 
"Customer Acceptance" has 15 waiting, so not worst waiting time.
"Draft Offer" has 240/300? Actually "Draft Offer": 240 s vs target 300, no SLA breach but has waiting = 30 s, so that is great.
"Fund Disbursement: Wait, through time 60 vs target 120, no breach, waiting is 50 s.
But seems the top candidates for worst performing are "Legal Approval" and "Risk Review." Also "Credit Assessment" might borderline even though the breach is lower amount than "Legal Approval" and "Risk Review".

However, "Credit Assessment" breach = 60 s whereas "Legal" breach = 300. But then comparing waiting times: "Legal" wait time is highest (600) and "Risk Review" waiting time is 480 s. "Credit Assessment" wait time is 200 s, but also "Verify Identity" wait time is only 80. So probably worst performing are "Legal Approval", "Risk Review", and "Credit Assessment" if we consider SLA breaches.

Alternatively, perhaps we should choose "Legal Approval", "Risk Review", and "Verify Identity"? But that doesn't conform since "Verify Identity": 120 s with breach 30 s; even though waiting is 80 s. But we want the three worst-performing based on SLA breaches and waiting time. The question's wording "three worst-performing" probably means the ones with the largest values of either waiting time, or can be combined metric of average waiting time and measure of SLA excess. Considering the numbers: "Legal Approval": Throughput = 900, waiting 600
"Risk Review": Throughput = 600, waiting = 480
"Credit Assessment": Throughput = 300, waiting = 200 (but it's not last but it qualifies as a breach and moderate waiting time)
Verify Identity: Throughput = 120, waiting = 80 (lowest among the breaches)

Then possibly the three worst are "Legal Approval", "Risk Review", "Credit Assessment", because then three worst: Because "Legal Approval" and "Risk Review" exceed the SLA by 300 seconds each; however "Credit Assessment" are among the breaches. But does output instructions "identify the three worst-performing activities based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting time." Possibly the "worst" ones are the ones with maximum average throughput delay and waiting time combined. They likely mean picking the ones with a marked difference between performance metric vs target and the highest waiting times. 
Maybe we compare:
Activity - Difference (throughput-target) and waiting time.

For each row with breaches:
Verify Identity: 
AvgThroughput - Target = 120 - 90 = +30, Waiting time 80 s
Credit Assessment: 
300 - 240 = +60, waiting time 200 s
Risk Review:
600 - 300 = +300, waiting time 480 s
Legal Approval:
900 - 600 = +300, waiting time 600 s.

Potentially we then consider worst by summing metrics. But maybe the rec: "based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting time" suggests that the worst ones are ones that breached their target by the greatest margins and have high waiting times as well. 
The top two just by waiting times are Legal Approval (600) and Risk Review (480). And then between Credit Assessment (200 waiting time) and Verify Identity (80 waiting time). But since "Credit Assessment" has a breach of 60 (then it's not as high SLA breach as others). Actually "Verify Identity" while waiting time is only 80, but it has a breach of 30. But "Credit Assessment" has a breach of 60 and waiting time 200, which is larger. But between the two, delaying may be a bit more important. The question says "jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting time". It doesn't say "maximum difference" individually. But if we assume we want to pick items where both metrics are problematic relative to the others. 
Probably the answer: Worst performing are:
1. Legal Approval: 900s vs target 600 (300 overshoot) and Avg_Waiting = 600 s (which is maximum among others).
2. Risk Review: 600s vs target 300 (300 overshoot) and waiting time 480 s.
This is two. The third candidate: "Credit Assessment" with 300s vs target 240 (60 overshoot) and waiting time 200 s. Meanwhile "Verify Identity" might not be as critical as "Credit Assessment" because Credit Assessment deals with creditworthiness data maybe more important to process outcomes than identity verification? However, let us check the wording that the activities with the worst performance overall are "jointly" considered by their violation of the SLA (how much their average throughput time exceeds the target SLA) and their average waiting times. That means all the SLA breaches have some waiting time issues. Among those that breach SLA, the most tented have highest absolute deviations. Looking at waiting times: Legal Approval highest waiting (600) and Risk Review (480) and then Credit Assessment (200) is next. 
So yes, I'd pick it's worst: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.
Alternatively, some might say "Credit Assessment" and "Verify Identity" are SLA violations, but "Credit Assessment" is bigger breach (60) than "Verify Identity" (30) but also has waiting time 200 vs 80. So yes, then the third worst is "Credit Assessment".
So then our memo will mention: "Legal Approval exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds and has an Avg Waiting Time of 600 s, Risk Review by 300 seconds and wait time 480 s, Credit Assessment by 60 seconds and wait time 200 s.
But instructions: "quantify by how much each activity exceeds its SLA" so we mention difference in seconds. 
"High waiting time" part: They state quantify by how much each activity exceeds its SLA, so for legal and risk review, that's both 300, for credit assessment is 60 extra.

And then add concrete, data-driven recommendations for each. The best idea: data-driven actions:
For Legal Approval, process steps could be "streamlined" or additional oversight. Could say: "Recommend: Implement automation or prioritize processing for high-value legal cases to reduce throughput time, aiming to decrease processing time by reducing burden of legal inquiry by a specific percentage." However, I need bullet points only so the bullet points should be the recommendations for each. Their instructions: "return only memo text" and bullet points only for the recommendations lines. So the memo text: We need to start with: "To: Orion COO", then begin "Memo: [subject]" etc. but instructions require the memo overall just be the memo text, only bullet points in recommendations and nothing else. There is no formatting instructions except message that we only return the memo text, exactly the memo as text with bullet points.

The memo should be approximately 150 words. Our memo text must not mention any activity that is absent from the table and only use the metrics provided. Therefore I can use only the activity data provided.

I must ground all sentences accurately in the data provided: Must mention each number exactly and avoid adding extra words.

I must refer to "Legal Approval", "Risk Review", "Credit Assessment". But how do I justify these three? The text says "identify the three worst-performing activities based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times" So it's basing on 2 metrics? The data: For Legal Approval: the throughput time is 900, which is 300 seconds above target SLA of 600, and waiting time is 600 seconds. For Risk Review: throughput time is 600, which is 300 seconds above target 300, waiting time is 480 seconds. For Credit Assessment: throughput time is 300, which is 60 seconds above target of 240, and waiting time 200 seconds. 
One could mention "Verify Identity" only if needed, but "verify identity" is not included if we compare, since it has trivial difference and lower waiting time. So we exclude that from worst performing.

We must produce no additional activity.

Thus I'll produce a memo like:

Subject: Executive Summary of Performance Metrics for [activities with highest SLA breaches]. 
But instructions: "Draft an executive memo (approx 150 words) for Orion's COO" means the text should be:

"Memo" beginning with a header such as "Memo: Performance Review Update" and then list the activities and recommended action.

However, instructions: "Return only the memo text." So then we return the memo text text.

Let's count word count: Approximately 150 words. We need carefully show recommended action.

I'll produce: "Memo: [to the COO]" then a paragraph summarizing.

I can structure my memo as:

"Memo: Performance Capacity Shortfall

Observation Data:
The three activities that have breached target SLA and exhibit high waiting times are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.

For each, we quantify by:
• Legal Approval: 900s throughput vs 600s target – exceedance by 300s; waiting time 600s.
• Risk Review: 600s vs 300s target – exceedance by 300s; waiting time 480s.
• Credit Assessment: 300s vs 240s target – exceedance by 60s; waiting time 200s.

Recommendations:
• Legal Approval: [action]. 
• Risk Review: [action]. 
• Credit Assessment: [action]."

I then need concrete data-driven actions for each, be bullet points now only for recommendations. They said "use bullet points only for recommendations." So I'll produce a bullet list with three items or each.

Now have idea: "legal approval" has a large waiting time. They may benefit from additional legal resource. When specifically "data-driven action", perhaps what "reduce waiting times" Possibly "Target reducing throughput time by 20%."

For each:
For Legal Approval: Action could be:
"Perform a detailed analysis of the step-by-step legal review process to identify bottlenecks, and pilot a dedicated legal team to process submissions in parallel, to reduce the average processing time from 900s to below target."

For Risk Review: maybe "risk review" could be improved by involving a compliance dashboard. Hmmm we need data-driven, and I can say "Implement a system integration improvement to automate data inputs thus reducing manual reviews and shorten waiting time."

For Credit Assessment: maybe "apply cross-training to staff on the credit risk calculations" or "Introduce a pre-screen mechanism to reduce load."

Wait, but we'll want the data-driven actions to be specific to each metrics.

Let's check each details:
- For Legal Approval: The measured time is 900 seconds, and waiting time is 600 seconds. The legal process is the longest. A potential action: "simplify or process automations, e.g. automated document verification", "increase staff allocations", etc. But I need to mention a measure with numbers maybe "reduce waiting times by implementing parallel workflows and triaging by submission complexity." But "data-driven" must include e.g., "reduce processing time by targeting the 600-second waiting period reduction by 30-40% so that processing time meets target."

Or maybe "identify steps that exceed average processing time, streamlining them as 20% more efficient." But must be data-driven? Well, we have numbers from output:
Action for Legal Approval: "Streamline legal review by triaging less complex cases for routine processing. This intervention is designed specifically to lower average throughput from 900s to below the target of 600s, by reducing waiting period by approximately 20-25%."

But then "Risk Review": Action might be: "Integrate credit risk scoring to pre-assess risk factors, potentially reducing processing from 600s to below target of 300s. Also, reassign resources to reduce waiting time." But I need to mention waiting time of 480 seconds. Possibly "Invest in reducing the manual part by expediting risk data consolidation to reduce time from 600s to at or below target." But to be more data-driven we can say "Implement a real-time risk dashboard to improve analysis speed." Let me produce something: "By prioritizing cases with high risk scores for immediate review, average processing time could be reduced from 600 s to target 300 s and waiting time improved."

Third "Credit Assessment": Its difference is 60 seconds. But waiting time is 200 seconds. Possibly "Implement automated data feeds for credit data to cut down analysis time, aiming to reduce overall average throughput to within the target SLA margin, and reduce waiting times proportionately."

But also we should mention ordering: "The three worst-performing activities and the recommended actions: ..." But instructions: "Point bullet points for recommendations only." Yes. We need three bullet points, one for each.

But specify each recommended action in bullet list.

Now I check the instructions exactly: "Draft an executive memo: identify the three worst-performing activities (jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times), quantify by how much each activity exceeds its SLA, and recommend one concrete, data-driven action for each."

So we need to produce a memo text that is approximately 150 words. It also says "Return only the memo text."

I need no markdown formatting and my answer should be simply text.

I shall produce a memo text with approximately 150 words. Let me produce a draft text.

I need to be careful with wording. Let me produce a rough draft text:

"Memo: Performance Analysis Update

Analysis of our process data identified three activities with the most problematic performance:
• Legal Approval: average throughput time of 900 seconds exceeds its target SLA of 600 seconds (a 300-second shortfall) and an average waiting time of 600 seconds. To address this, we recommend implementing a parallel processing model that delegates simpler legal cases to specialized teams. [But need bullet instructions?]. 
• Risk Review: performance shows an average throughput time of 600 seconds against a target of 300 seconds, a 300-second excess, with a waiting time of 480 seconds. Recommendation: Integrate automated risk scoring and real-time analytics to accelerate decision-making.
• Credit Assessment: records a throughput of 300 seconds versus a target of 240 seconds (exceeds by 60 seconds) and a waiting time of 200 seconds. Recommendation: Deploy automated credit data ingestion tools to reduce manual review time.

Finally note: [Empty summary]."

Wait, check instructions: "bullet points only for the recommendations" so I must only have bullet points for those line items. Also must "return only the memo text" meaning nothing else preceding or following? But instructions say "Return only the memo text."

But careful: The instructions indicate: "return only the memo text", and "use bullet points only for the recommendations." That implies the recommendations section must be in bullet points, but rest of text can be narrative.

I must ground every sentence in the supplied data. I'll try to ensure I'm not adding extra metrics or discussing non-existing metrics.

I check data from table: I must re-read the table:
Activity column: "Receive Application, 45,10,1200,60" no breach, skip.
"Verify Identity: 120 (vs 90, so breach 30); but waiting time is 80, smaller than Credit Assessment's 200. So likely not worst.
"Credit Assessment: 300 vs 240 -> breach 60 s; waiting 200 s
"Risk Review: 600 vs 300 -> breach 300 s; waiting 480 s
"Draft Offer: 240 vs 300 over; skip because 240 < target = 300 means no breach if the time is less than target? Actually, the average throughput time for activity "Draft Offer" is 240 s which is below its target of 300 s. So it's efficient. "Legal Approval": 900 vs 600 -> breach 300 s; waiting 600 s.
"Customer Acceptance": 180 vs 300, no breach; waiting 15.
"Fund Disbursement": 60 vs 120, no breach; waiting 50.

So indeed the worst performing are those that breached their respective SLAs: "Verify Identity" (SMaller breach), "Credit Assessment", "Risk Review", "Legal Approval". But if we look at waiting times: "Legal Approval" 600 is worst than "Risk Review" (480), then "Credit Assessment" (200), then "Verify Identity" (80). If we do want the three worst, we may want to pick the ones with the highest average waiting time. But instructions "jointly invalid" so likely to pick "Legal Approval", "Risk Review", "Credit Assessment" because "Legal Approval" and "Risk Review" are the worst overall because they are well beyond their target SLA by +300, and "Credit Assessment" is second child in waiting time if we exclude "Verify Identity" which just breaches by only 30 seconds. All be final: The answer picks those three.

Now produce an executive memo text:

I must generate a text without any markdown formatting or extra bullet points except bullet lists for recommendations. So I'll produce text in plain text.

Plan:

Memo text: "Memo: [subject]" then "Data shows that among our processes, [activity names] have the greatest SLA and waiting time issues." I'll produce the following text:

"Memo: Performance Bottlenecks and Recommended Actions

Data from our process metrics indicates that three processes significantly exceed their target SLA numbers and exhibit concerning average waiting times. Specifically:

1. Legal Approval’s average throughput time of 900 seconds overshoots its target SLA of 600 seconds by 300 seconds, with a high average waiting time of 600 seconds.
2. Risk Review’s throughput time of 600 seconds exceeds its target SLA of 300 seconds by 300 seconds, and records a notably high waiting time of 480 seconds.
3. Credit Assessment, although marginally over its target SLA of 240 seconds by 60 seconds, still shows an average throughput time of 300 seconds and a waiting time of 200 seconds.

To address these critical bottlenecks:
• Legal Approval: Initiate a triaging system that funnels less complex cases to dedicated rapid-review teams, thereby reducing processing and waiting times.
• Risk Review: Adopt real-time risk scoring using automated analytics to accelerate the review process and bring throughput times closer to the target.
• Credit Assessment: Implement a dedicated automated data ingestion pipeline to curtail the extra 60-second processing delay and lower waiting time.

By focusing on these targeted improvements, we can optimize overall process efficiency and meet our SLA targets."

That is acceptable but I must format recommendations as bullet points. But instructions say: "Use bullet points only for the recommendations." So, I must produce a bullet list of recommendations. And then must return only memo text.

I must be careful: "Target OR1 COO" - but "coo provided text" but our instructions says “draft an executive memo for Orion’s COO”. So I must provide the text.

Now I'll try to produce approximate text of exactly about 150 words. It says "approximately 150 words," so I must try to get around that. But I must produce a summary memo that is around 150 words? The instructions say "draft an memo approximately 150 words."

Let's count words: I must aim for around 150 words. Let me check our draft at rough count.
I'll produce a new draft.

"Orion's COO Memo
Process data indicate three activity areas far exceeding their target SLAs and demonstrating high waiting times. Legal Approval’s throughput time of 900 s exceeds target 600 s by 300 s, with an average waiting time of 600 s. Risk Review records 600 s versus target 300 s, a 300 s shortfall, along with a 480 s waiting time. Credit Assessment shows a throughput of 300 s against target 240 s, falling short by 60 s, while its waiting time is 200 s.
To resolve these delays:
• For Legal Approval: Introduce a triage mechanism directing less complex cases to a fast-track team to reduce processing and waiting time.
• For Risk Review: Leverage automated risk scoring and real-time dashboards to accelerate processing and lower waiting times.
• For Credit Assessment: Deploy an automated data ingestion platform to trim the 60 s delay and shorten waiting time.
Addressing these issues is critical for meeting our SLA benchmarks."

Now I'll try to refine further with correct grammar. I must not add extra activities and must only touch the presented ones. Also check if instructs "Return only memo text." So I'll produce the final memo in plain text.

Word count: Let's count approximate words: "Memo: Performance update (not necessary) but just output memo text will suffice.
I summarise them to get approximate 150 words:
(e.g.) "Memo: Orion Process Efficiency Update - Following analysis of our processes metrics, three activities emerge as critical bottlenecks, breaching their SLA targets through both excessive throughput times and high waiting times. Legal Approval clocks 900s against a target of 600s (a 300-second excess) and faces an average waiting time of 600s; Risk Review processes 600s versus 300s target (300 seconds over) with waiting time of 480s; while Credit Assessment lags at 300s vs target of 240s (60 seconds over) with waiting time of 200s. For remediation: a triage system could streamline Legal Approval. Implementing real-time risk analytics may improve Risk Review efficiency, and automating data ingestion could cut Credit Assessment delays. Addressing these areas is paramount to meeting our overall service standards."

I must include bullet recommendations using bullet points only for the recommendations. So produce bullet points only for the recommended actions. The rest of the text in regular paragraphs. And must not mention details outside of table.

I can include simple bullet recommendations:
"• For Legal Approval: Streamline process by assigning a dedicated fast-track protocol for less complex cases to reduce processing delay.
• For Risk Review: Integrate real-time risk analytics and a fast-track review process to narrow the 300-second gap.
• For Credit Assessment: Automate data ingestion to eliminate the 60-second processing excess and lower wait times."
But need to use only three bullet points.

Let's produce a final summary memo text that is around 150 words.

I'll produce final text with similarities. Possibly I'd produce something like:

Memo:

"Orion’s COO Memo

Data highlights three critical process bottlenecks:
• Legal Approval: Achieves 900 seconds vs. a target of 600 (300 seconds over) and an average waiting time of 600 seconds.
• Risk Review: Registers 600 seconds vs. 300 (300 seconds over) and a waiting time of 480 seconds.
• Credit Assessment: Logs 300 seconds vs. target 240 (60 seconds over) with a waiting time of 200 seconds.

To remedy these inefficiencies, we recommend:
• Legal Approval: Implement a triage mechanism to divert straightforward cases to dedicated fast-track teams, thereby reducing processing and waiting times.
• Risk Review: Deploy real-time risk scoring and analytics to accelerate review cycles and align throughput nearer to target.
• Credit Assessment: Introduce automated data ingestion systems to reduce the 60-second excess, thereby diminishing overall waiting time."

That text is roughly 150 words.

I'll now produce final output with plain text, making sure to no markdown formatting.

I'll produce a bullet list for recommendations. I'll produce text that is exactly and succinct, referencing only data provided. The instructions says "Return the memo text only." So I'll just produce text starting with "Memo:" etc.

I'll produce final answer:Orion’s COO—memo follows:

Process data identify three activities exceeding their target SLAs while incurring high waiting times. Specifically, Legal Approval’s average throughput of 900 s is 300 s over its 600 s target and it endures an average waiting time of 600 s; Risk Review attains 600 s (300 s above target 300 s) with a 480 s wait; and Credit Assessment shows 300 s (60 s over target 240 s) plus a 200 s delay.

• For Legal Approval: Introduce a case triage system; delegate simpler cases to a fast‑track team to eliminate the 300‑s processing excess and reduce waiting time by parallelizing reviews.
• For Risk Review: Implement real‑time risk analytics to accelerate decision‑making and narrow the 300‑s throughput gap by expediting routine reviews.
• For Credit Assessment: Deploy an automated data ingestion platform to eliminate the 60‑s processing delay and lower the overall waiting period.

Addressing these specific process delays will help realign our performance with our SLA benchmarks.
