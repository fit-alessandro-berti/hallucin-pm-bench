## Step 1: Understand the given FACT and the task
The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," with no other activities in between. We need to verify if this is accurate based on the provided event-log excerpt.

## Step 2: Examine the event-log excerpt for relevant information
The event-log excerpt contains 13 events across 4 CaseIDs: C001, C002, C003, and C004. We need to analyze the sequence of activities for each CaseID to check if "Validate_Payment" follows "Receive_Order" immediately.

## Step ## Step 3: Analyze the activity sequence for each CaseID
- For C001: Receive_Order -> Validate_Payment -> Pack_Items. "Validate_Payment" occurs after "Receive_Order".
- For C002: Receive_Order -> Pack_Items -> Validate_Payment. "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order"; "Pack_Items" occurs in between.
- For C003: Receive_Order -> Validate_Payment -> Ship_Order. "Validate_Payment" occurs immediately after "Receive_Order".
- For C004: Receive_Order -> Check_Fraud -> Validate_Payment -> Pack_Items. "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order"; "Check_Fraud" occurs in between.

## Step 4: Evaluate the FACT based on the analysis
From Step 3, we see that:
- For C001, the sequence supports the FACT.
- For C002, "Pack_Items" occurs before "Validate_Payment", so the FACT is not supported.
- For C003, the sequence supports the FACT.
- For C004, "Check_Fraud" occurs before "Validate_Payment", so the FACT is not supported.

## Step 5: Determine the accuracy of the FACT
Since there are cases (C002 and C004) where "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order", the FACT is not accurate.

## Step 6: Provide the answer and justification
The FACT is not accurate because there are instances where "Validate_Payment" is not immediately after "Receive_Order". Specifically, for C002, "Pack_Items" occurs before "Validate_Payment", and for C004, "Check_Fraud" occurs before "Validate_Payment".

The final answer is: $\boxed{No}$ 
Justification: The relevant CaseIDs that contradict the FACT are C002 (Receive_Order -> Pack_Items -> Validate_Payment) and C004 (Receive_Order -> Check_Fraud -> Validate_Payment -> Pack_Items), indicating that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order".
