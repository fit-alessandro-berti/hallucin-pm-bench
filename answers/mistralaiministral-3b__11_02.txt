**Executive Memo**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance

**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst

**Date:** April 15, 2025

**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Analysis

**Three Worst-Performing Activities:**

1. **Request_Documents**: With an average throughput of 190 cases per day and an average wait time of 150 minutes, this activity is the slowest in the process. The high rework rate (22.0%) and SLA breach rate (5.5%) further indicate inefficiency and delays.

2. **Review_Documents**: This activity has the highest average processing time (25 minutes) and variability (9 minutes), resulting in a high SLA breach rate (12.4%). The low throughput of 185 cases per day suggests a bottleneck.

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Despite a relatively high throughput (270 cases per day), the activity has the second-highest average wait time (18 minutes) and a high SLA breach rate (3.2%). This indicates a significant backlog and inefficiency.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Request_Documents**: Implement a streamlined document request process to reduce wait times and improve efficiency. This could involve automating document requests and reducing manual intervention.

2. **Review_Documents**: Investigate the root cause of the high variability in processing times. This could involve retraining staff, optimizing workflows, or implementing technology to standardize the review process.

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Improve communication and coordination between initial assessment and document review teams to reduce backlogs and wait times. This could involve setting up a shared inbox or using a project management tool to track progress.

**Next Steps:** I recommend scheduling a meeting with the respective teams to discuss these findings and develop action plans.
