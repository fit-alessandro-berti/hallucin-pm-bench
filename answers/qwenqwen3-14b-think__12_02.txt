No. The claim is false. For case C002, Validate_Payment (line 5) occurs after Check_Inventory (line 4), not directly after Receive_Order (line 3). For C003, Validate_Payment (line 6) precedes Receive_Order (line 7). For C005, Validate_Payment (line 11) occurs without any prior Receive_Order in the log. Thus, Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order.
