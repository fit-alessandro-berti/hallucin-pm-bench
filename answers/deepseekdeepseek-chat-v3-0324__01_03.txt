   *Skips Manual-Underwriting-Review if risk is Low/Medium **and** requested amount ≤ €250K.*  
3. **TriVote (Step 6)**  
   *Requires at least 2 approvals out of 3 (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer).*  

### **b) Documents in Order of First Appearance**  
1. **Form 14B** (Application)  
2. **Scorecard–Cyan, -Magenta, -Yellow** (Risk Check inputs)  
3. **Deck Memo** (Manual Underwriting, if triggered)  
4. **Offer Sheet 77** (Binding Offer)
