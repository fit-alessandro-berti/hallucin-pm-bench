The data identify Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment as the three worst-performing activities when considering SLA breaches and high waiting times. Legal Approval averages 900s throughput against a 600s target (300s over SLA) and posts 600s average waiting across 465 cases. Risk Review averages 600s throughput versus a 300s target (300s over SLA) with 480s waiting across 480 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s throughput versus a 240s target (60s over SLA) with 200s waiting across 1175 cases. These activities handle 465, 480, and 1175 cases respectively and all exceed their SLAs.  
• Legal Approval: reallocate approval capacity to reduce the 600s average waiting time and close the 300s SLA gap.  
• Risk Review: prioritise queue management to cut the 480s waiting time contributing to the 300s SLA breach.  
• Credit Assessment: add assessment capacity to lower the 200s waiting time and eliminate the 60s SLA overrun.
