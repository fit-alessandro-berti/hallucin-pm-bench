There is exactly 1 occurrence of the activity “Manual Fraud Check” in the provided data.

Answer to 2️⃣ (≤ 120 words):  
The excerpt covers only three cases on a single day. While it shows one instance of “Manual Fraud Check,” there is no information about how many more cases (and possible manual fraud checks) occurred during the rest of the month. An analyst seeing only these three cases might incorrectly estimate the overall frequency of that activity by applying the ratio from this small snippet to the entire month. Without the full data, it is impossible to confirm if the observed ratio holds for all cases or if this short window is atypical.
