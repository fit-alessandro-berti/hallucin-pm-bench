**Yes**, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Justification:**
In this Petri net, T3 and T5 are **conflicting transitions** because they both consume a token from place `p2`. The following sequence from the initial marking demonstrates T5 firing first:

1.  **Fire T1**:
    *   Consumes the token from `p0` (Initial `p0=1` $\to$ `p0=0`).
    *   Produces tokens at `p1` and `p2` (`p1=0` $\to$ `1`, `p2=0` $\to$ `1`).
    *   *Current Marking:* `p1=1, p2=1, p0=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0`.
2.  **Fire T5**:
    *   **Enabled check:** Requires `p3` (contains 0, satisfied) and inhibits `p4` (contains 0, satisfied).
    *   Consumes token from `p2` (`p2=1` $\to$ `0`).
    *   Produces token at `p6`.
    *   *Current Marking:* `p1=1, p6=1, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p0=0`.
3.  **Result:** T5 has successfully fired while T3 is still disabled (it requires a token in `p2`, which was consumed by T5).
