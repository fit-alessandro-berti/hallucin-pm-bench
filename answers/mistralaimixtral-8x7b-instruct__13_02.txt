1. The activity **"Manual\_Fraud\_Check"** occurs once in the excerpt, in case C05.
2. a) There are 48 events in total, so the activity appears in 1/48 = **2.08%** of all events.
   b) There are 12 unique cases, so the activity appears in 1/12 = **8.33%** of all unique cases.
3. A low-support activity like **"Manual\_Fraud\_Check"** may mislead performance or predictive analyses if generalized from this slice because it may not be representative of the overall process. It could be an exception or a rare case, and if it is given the same weight as high-support activities, it might skew the analysis results. This could lead to incorrect conclusions about the process, such as overestimating the frequency of manual fraud checks or their impact on the overall claim-payout process.
