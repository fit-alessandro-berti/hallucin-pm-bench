**Answer: No**

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1**: Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur **once each and in that order**.  
  ✅ **Violated**: In the trace, `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occurs **before** `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE), which is the wrong order.

- **Rule 2**: If the case-level attribute **severity = "High"**, activity `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen **after both QE and RA**.  
  ❌ **Not applicable** (since Rule 1 is violated, this rule is also not satisfied, but it would have been satisfied if Rule 1 were followed).

- **Rule 3**: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must **not occur until after** QE **and** RA are complete.  
  ❌ **Violated**: `Notify_Authorities` occurs **before** RA is completed, which violates this rule.

- **Rule 4**: `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only **after** NA (and, if required by rule 2, after VP).  
  ❌ **Violated**: `Close_Case` occurs **before** NA, which violates this rule.

**Conclusion**: The trace is **not compliant** with ruleset R due to violations of Rules 1, 3, and 4.
