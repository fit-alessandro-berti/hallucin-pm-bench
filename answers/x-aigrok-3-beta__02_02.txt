Let's analyze the provided XES event log fragment and answer the questions step by step.

### Q1: How many **distinct cases** are present in this fragment?
To determine the number of distinct cases, we look at the unique values of the `case` attribute in the event log. From the given 10 lines, the cases are:
- C001 (appears in lines 1, 3, 7)
- C002 (appears in lines 2, 5, 8, 10)
- C003 (appears in lines 4, 6, 9)

There are **3 distinct cases** in this fragment.

**Answer Q1: 3**

### Q2: For case **“C002”**, list the **sequence of activities** in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).
To answer this, we filter the events for case "C002" and list the activities (from the `concept:name` attribute) in the order of their timestamps (i.e., the order they appear in the log):
- Line 2: Receive_Order (2025-03-01T09:15:10)
- Line 5: Check_Stock (2025-03-01T09:22:55)
- Line 8: Arrange_Delivery (2025-03-01T10:15:20)
- Line 10: Ship_Order (2025-03-01T10:25:40)

The sequence of activities for case "C002" is:  
**Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

**Answer Q2: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

### Q3: Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).
To answer this, we identify all occurrences of the activity "Ship_Order" in the log and determine the activity that immediately precedes it within the same case. We then list the distinct preceding activities in alphabetical order.

- For case "C001":
  - Ship_Order occurs in line 7 (2025-03-01T10:05:10)
  - The previous event for C001 is in line 3: Check_Stock
  - **Preceding activity: Check_Stock**

- For case "C002":
  - Ship_Order occurs in line 10 (2025-03-01T10:25:40)
  - The previous event for C002 is in line 8: Arrange_Delivery
  - **Preceding activity: Arrange_Delivery**

- For case "C003":
  - Ship_Order occurs in line 9 (2025-03-01T10:20:30)
  - The previous event for C003 is in line 6: Check_Stock
  - **Preceding activity: Check_Stock**

The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
- Arrange_Delivery (from case C002)
- Check_Stock (from cases C001 and C003)

Listing them alphabetically (one per line):  
**Arrange_Delivery**  
**Check_Stock**

**Answer Q3:**  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
