**Yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

### Shortest Firing Sequence

The shortest firing sequence that demonstrates this is:

**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

### Step-by-Step Analysis

Here is the state of the Petri net after each transition in the sequence, showing how T5 becomes enabled while T3 is not.

1.  **Initial Marking:**
    *   `p0 = 1`

2.  **Fire T1 (`p0 -> pa, pb`):**
    *   **Enabling:** T1 is enabled because `p0` contains a token.
    *   **Action:** T1 fires, consuming the token from `p0` and producing one token each in `pa` and `pb`.
    *   **Resulting Marking:** `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`

3.  **Fire T2b (`pa -> pd`):**
    *   **Enabling:** T2b is enabled because `pa` contains a token. (Note: T2 is also enabled, but we choose T2b to take the shortcut).
    *   **Action:** T2b fires, consuming the token from `pa` and producing a token in `pd`.
    *   **Resulting Marking:** `pb = 1`, `pd = 1`
    *   **Key Observation:** At this point, T3 is **not enabled** because its input place `pc` is empty.

4.  **Fire T4 (`pb -> pe`):**
    *   **Enabling:** T4 is enabled because `pb` contains a token.
    *   **Action:** T4 fires, consuming the token from `pb` and producing a token in `pe`.
    *   **Resulting Marking:** `pd = 1`, `pe = 1`
    *   **Key Observation:** T3 remains **not enabled** as `pc` is still empty.

5.  **Fire T5 (`pd, pe -> pf`):**
    *   **Enabling:** T5 is now enabled because its input places `pd` and `pe` both contain tokens.
    *   **Action:** T5 fires.
    *   **Conclusion:** T5 has successfully fired. At no point in this sequence was transition T3 enabled. Therefore, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.
