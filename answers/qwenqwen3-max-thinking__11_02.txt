**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance – Priority Improvement Areas  

Three activities warrant immediate attention:  

1. **Request_Documents**: Exceptionally high rework (22.0%) and long wait time (150 min) suggest inefficient or unclear document requests. *Action:* Redesign the initial request template to be more specific and include real-time validation, targeting a 50% rework reduction.  

2. **Review_Documents**: Highest SLA breach (12.4%) and processing time variability (stdev = 9 min) indicate inconsistent handling. *Action:* Implement standardized review checklists and tiered routing based on claim complexity to reduce variability and breaches.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Elevated SLA breaches (3.2%) relative to its short processing time (12 min) point to upstream bottlenecks or unclear assessment criteria. *Action:* Introduce a pre-assessment triage step to ensure only complete claims enter this stage, reducing unnecessary delays.  

All other activities perform within acceptable thresholds (rework <1%, SLA breaches <1.5%). Focus on these three will significantly improve throughput and customer experience.
