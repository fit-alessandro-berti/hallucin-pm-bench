1️⃣ The activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **once** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks from this snippet because it represents a very small sample of the full month-long log. The snippet shows only three cases, with only one involving a manual fraud check. This could lead to an underestimation if manual checks are more common in other parts of the process not captured here. Conversely, if manual checks are rare and typically occur under specific conditions (e.g., flagged applications), the analyst might overestimate their frequency if those conditions are prevalent in the full log. Additionally, the timing and sequence of activities in this snippet do not provide context for understanding when manual checks are triggered, further complicating an accurate assessment.
