No.

**Justification:**

*   **Rule 1 Violated:** `Quality_Engineer_Review` must occur before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`. In this trace, `Notify_Authorities` occurs *between* these two activities, violating the required order and the "once each" requirement for the review steps.
*   **Rule 3 Violated:** `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete. The rule states NA must not occur until after QE *and* RA are complete.
*   **Rule 4 Violated:** `Close_Case` occurs after `VP_Safety_Approval`, but `VP_Safety_Approval` itself is out of order relative to the required review steps (QE and RA), making the condition for closing the case also implicitly violated. The rule also states `Close_Case` may occur only after NA, which is also violated due to the preceding rule violations.
