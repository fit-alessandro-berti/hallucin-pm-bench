**Answer: No**

**Justification:**  
The fact claims that *Validate_Payment* is always the **immediate** successor of *Receive_Order* (i.e., no other activity may appear between them). The log excerpt contains two cases where this pattern is broken:

- **Case C002** – the sequence is  
  `Receive_Order (09:30:00) → Pack_Items (09:50:00) → Validate_Payment (10:05:00)`  
  Here *Pack_Items* occurs between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*, violating the “no other activities in between” rule.

- **Case C004** – the sequence is  
  `Receive_Order (10:05:00) → Check_Fraud (10:07:00) → Validate_Payment (10:20:00) → Pack_Items (10:45:00)`  
  In this case *Check_Fraud* separates *Receive_Order* from *Validate_Payment*, again breaking the required immediate adjacency.

Because at least one case (in fact, two) does not satisfy the stated pattern, the fact is **not accurate** for the given event‑log excerpt.
