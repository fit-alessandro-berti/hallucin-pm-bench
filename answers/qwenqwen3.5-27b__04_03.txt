No

**Justification:**
*   **Rule 1:** Satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` (step 3) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (step 5).
*   **Rule 2:** Satisfied. Given `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` (step 6) occurs after both QE (step 3) and RA (step 5).
*   **Rule 3:** **Violated.** `Notify_Authorities` (step 4) occurred before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (step 5) was complete. The rule requires NA to occur after **both** QE and RA.
*   **Rule 4:** Satisfied. `Close_Case` (step 7) occurs after `Notify_Authorities` (step 4) and `VP_Safety_Approval` (step 6).

Since Rule 3 is violated, the trace is not compliant.
