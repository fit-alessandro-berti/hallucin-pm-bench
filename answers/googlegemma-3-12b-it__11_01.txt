**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** COO, Orion Insurance
**FROM:** [Your Name], Senior Process Mining Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Critical Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Immediate Actions

Our process mining analysis reveals significant waiting-time inefficiencies. The three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Request_Documents:** Avg. Waiting: 36.5 hrs, 95th Percentile: 120 hrs. **Action:** Implement automated document requests & pre-population using claim data to reduce manual intervention.
2. **Send_Closure_Letter:** Avg. Waiting: 12.2 hrs, 95th Percentile: 44 hrs. **Action:** Integrate letter generation directly into the claim approval workflow, eliminating manual queueing.
3. **Initial_Screening:** Avg. Waiting: 2.1 hrs, 95th Percentile: 5.6 hrs. **Action:** Prioritize screening based on claim complexity scores, automating simpler cases.

These targeted interventions, driven by data insights, can each realistically achieve >20% reduction in waiting times, significantly improving customer experience and operational efficiency.
