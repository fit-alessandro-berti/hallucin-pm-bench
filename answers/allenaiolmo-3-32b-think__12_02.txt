The fact is inaccurate. For case C003, line 6 shows *Validate_Payment* occurring before *Receive_Order* (line 7), violating the "follows" condition. Additionally, case C005 (line 11) has *Validate_Payment* with no preceding *Receive_Order* in the log fragment, further contradicting the claim. While *Validate_Payment* follows *Receive_Order* in cases C001 and C004, the presence of counterexamples (C003 and C005) disproves the universal assertion.
