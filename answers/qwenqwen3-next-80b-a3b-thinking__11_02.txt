Dear COO,  

Q1 2025 performance data reveals three critical bottlenecks:  

1. **Review_Documents** (12.4% SLA breach, stdev 9 processing time): Inconsistent handling drives delays.  
   *Action: Deploy AI-based document validation tools to standardize reviews.  

2. **Request_Documents** (22% rework, 150-min wait): Unclear requirements cause redundant requests.  
   *Action: Implement digital checklist with real-time validation pre-submission.  

3. **Initial_Assessment** (3.2% SLA breach): Manual data entry slows processing.  
   *Action: Auto-populate case data from prior steps to reduce processing time.  

Prioritizing these improvements will significantly reduce cycle times and SLA breaches.  

Regards,  
Senior Process-Performance Analyst
