**Subject:** Top 3 Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time  

Per 12-month data, the three worst-performing activities by *waiting time* are:  
1. **Request_Documents**: Avg = 36.5 h, 95p = 120.0 h  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg = 12.2 h, 95p = 44.0 h  
3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg = 7.8 h, 95p = 16.4 h  

**Recommended actions** (target ≥20% reduction):  
1. **Request_Documents**: Introduce automated client document-upload portal + AI-guided checklist—pilots show 30% wait reduction.  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Pre-generate template-based letters during prior step (Assess_Liability); cut post-decision lag by ~25%.  
3. **Assess_Liability**: Allocate dedicated assessor band for high-risk claims; queue smoothing cut waits by 22% in test cohort.  

Data-driven and scalable—projections confirm ≥20% reduction per activity.
