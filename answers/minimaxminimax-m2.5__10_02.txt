# RACI Matrix for AtlasRemit Payment Processing

Based on the informal process description and applying the mandated vocabulary:

| Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|------|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|:----------:|
| Receive and log customer transfer instruction | **R** | I | - |
| Screen payment against sanctions list | **R** | I | - |
| Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary | **R** | **A** | - |
| Approve high-risk transaction | - | **R/A** | C |
| Release payment | **R** | I | - |
| Ensure SWIFT message is sent | I | - | **R/A** |
| Archive case file | I | I | **R/A** |
| Notify Regulatory Liaison of completion | - | **I** | **R** |

**Legend:**
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)
- **A** = Accountable (final decision authority)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)
- **I** = Informed (kept updated)

**Notes:**
- "KYC Review" is used in place of "customer due diligence"
- "Regulatory Liaison" is used in place of "compliance officer"
- "Transaction Analyst" is used in place of "payment clerk"
- IT Support remains unchanged as it is not a role subject to the vocabulary mandate
