To: COO, Orion Insurance  
From: [Your Name], Senior Process-Mining Analyst  
Date: [Insert Date]  
Subject: Top Three Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time  

The three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:  
1. **Request_Documents** (Avg: 36.5h, 95p: 120h). Automation of document requests could reduce waiting by â‰¥20% by eliminating manual bottlenecks.  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter** (Avg: 12.2h, 95p: 44h). Parallelizing closure workflows or optimizing resource allocation may cut delays.  
3. **Assess_Liability** (Avg: 7.8h, 95p: 16.4h). Increasing assessor capacity or implementing parallel assessments could achieve the target.  

These actions target root causes of delays, leveraging data on high waiting times.
