No  

**Justification:**  
- Rule 1 is satisfied: `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occur in the required order (QE before RA), each once.  
- Rule 2 is satisfied: The case has high severity, and `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.  
- Rule 3 is violated: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before RA is complete. This is forbidden as NA must wait for both reviews.  
- Rule 4 is satisfied: `Close_Case` occurs after NA and VP (required by high severity).  

**Summary:** The trace violates Rule 3, so it is not compliant.
