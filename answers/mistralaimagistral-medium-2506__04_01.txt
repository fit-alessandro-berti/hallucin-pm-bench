Compliant.

Justification:
1. Rule 1 is satisfied: The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, and two approvals (`Approve_PO` by Procurement Officer and `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO) occur before `Issue_PO` (steps 2 & 3).
2. Rule 2 is satisfied: Although `Quality_Check` is missing (as allowed by `Expedite_Flag`), `Risk_Assessment` occurs before the first `Ship_Goods` (step 9 before step 8). However, upon closer inspection, `Ship_Goods` occurs at step 8, and `Risk_Assessment` occurs at step 9, which violates the condition that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** `Ship_Goods`. This is incorrect in my initial analysis.
   Correction: **Rule 2 is violated** because `Ship_Goods` (step 8) occurs before `Risk_Assessment` (step 9).
   Therefore, the trace is **Non-compliant**.

--- (Revised final answer)
Non-compliant.

Justification:
1. Rule 1 is satisfied (approvals before `Issue_PO`).
2. Rule 2 is violated: `Risk_Assessment` (step 9) occurs *after* `Ship_Goods` (step 8), which violates the requirement that it must occur *before* `Ship_Goods`.
3. Rules 3–5 are satisfied (timely `Three_way_match`, no Intern after CFO, and proper termination with `Archive_Record`).

**Final decision: Non-compliant** (due to Rule 2 violation).

Apologies for the initial oversight—the trace does not comply.
