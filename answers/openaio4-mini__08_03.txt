Yes – you don’t need T3 at all if you use the “shortcut” T2b to produce pd.  One shortest firing sequence is

  T1, T2b, T4, T5  

Explanation of markings:

  M₀: p0=1  
  –T1→ M₁: pa=1, pb=1  
  –T2b→ M₂: pd=1, pb=1      (note: pc is still 0, so T3 has never fired)  
  –T4→ M₃: pd=1, pe=1  
  –T5→ M₄: pf=1  

At no point did T3 fire, yet T5 fires in step 4.
