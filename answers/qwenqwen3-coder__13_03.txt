1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt (for CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate its frequency because this snippet is not representative of the full log. It contains only 3 cases, of which only one involves a manual fraud check. In the full month-long log, the proportion of manual vs. automatic checks could differ significantly. Additionally, this snippet shows only a few activities per case and may not capture the full process variety or volume where manual checks are more/less frequent. The small sample size leads to unreliable generalization.
