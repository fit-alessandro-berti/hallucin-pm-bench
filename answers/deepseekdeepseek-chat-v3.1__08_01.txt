Let's analyze the Petri net to determine if T5 can fire before T3.

**Initial marking:** M0 = (p0:1, p1:0, p2:0, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0)

T5 has:
- A normal input arc from p3 (so it requires at least one token in p3 to be enabled).
- An inhibitor arc from p4 (so it requires that p4 has zero tokens to be enabled).

For T5 to fire, we need:
- p3 >= 1
- p4 = 0

Now, T3 has an input arc from p2. So for T3 to fire, we need at least one token in p2.

To have T5 fire *before* T3, we need to reach a state where:
- p3 has a token (so T2 must have fired, which requires p1 to have a token)
- p4 has zero tokens (so T3 must not have fired, because if T3 fires, it puts a token in p4)

But note: the only way to get a token in p3 is by firing T2, which requires a token in p1. Similarly, the only way to get a token in p2 (which is needed for T3) is by firing T1.

T1 is the only transition enabled initially. Firing T1 consumes the token in p0 and produces tokens in p1 and p2.

So after firing T1, we get M1 = (p0:0, p1:1, p2:1, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0)

Now in M1:
- T2 is enabled (p1 has a token)
- T3 is enabled (p2 has a token)

If we fire T2 next, we get M2 = (p0:0, p1:0, p2:1, p3:1, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0)

In M2:
- p3 has a token and p4 has zero tokens -> T5 is enabled.
- T3 is still enabled (p2 has a token).

So we can fire T5 at this point. This would be *before* firing T3.

Firing T5 in M2: consumes the token in p3 (due to normal arc) and checks that p4=0 (due to inhibitor). It produces a token in p6.
So we get M3 = (p0:0, p1:0, p2:1, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:1)

Now T3 is still enabled (p2 has a token), so we can fire it later.

Therefore, **yes**, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Concrete firing sequence:**
1. Fire T1: consumes p0, produces p1 and p2. Marking: (p1:1, p2:1)
2. Fire T2: consumes p1, produces p3. Marking: (p2:1, p3:1)
3. Fire T5: consumes p3 (and requires p4=0, which is true), produces p6. Marking: (p2:1, p6:1)

Now T3 has not been fired yet, and we have already fired T5.

**Justification:** After the parallel split (T1), we can choose to fire T2 (which enables T5) without firing T3. Since T5 has an inhibitor from p4, it can fire as long as T3 hasn't put a token in p4. So by firing T2 first and then T5, we avoid firing T3 until after T5 has fired.

Thus, T5 can fire before T3.
