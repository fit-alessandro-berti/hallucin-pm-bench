# Cycle Time Analysis for "Approve Invoice" Activity

## Inability to Compute Metrics

I cannot calculate the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity because the event log provided (Artefact A) is a stub with only the column headers preserved. All actual data rows, including timestamps that would be needed for cycle time calculations, have been redacted for privacy reasons. Without the actual start_time and complete_time values for each "Approve Invoice" activity instance, it is mathematically impossible to compute any time-based metrics.

While Artefact B mentions a historical average of 7.8 days from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice," this represents a different metric (time between activities) rather than the cycle time of the approval activity itself (time from start to completion of a single activity).

AI systems cannot infer actual process performance metrics without the underlying timestamp data.
