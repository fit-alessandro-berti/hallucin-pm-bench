**No**

**Justification:**  
The FACT is inaccurate because "Validate_Payment" does not *always* occur immediately after "Receive_Order" with no intervening activities. Counterexamples:  
- **C002**: Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05).  
- **C004**: Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20).  

(It holds for C001 and C003, but "always" requires consistency across all cases.)
