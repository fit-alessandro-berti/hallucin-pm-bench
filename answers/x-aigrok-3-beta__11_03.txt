Subject: Urgent Process Performance Issues and Recommendations

Dear COO,

Our analysis of Orion Creditâ€™s process performance data reveals three activities with significant SLA breaches and high waiting times, requiring immediate attention. First, Risk Review exceeds its SLA of 300 seconds by 300 seconds, with an average throughput time of 600 seconds and waiting time of 480 seconds. Second, Credit Assessment surpasses its SLA of 240 seconds by 60 seconds, with a throughput time of 300 seconds and waiting time of 200 seconds. Third, Legal Approval exceeds its SLA of 600 seconds by 300 seconds, with a throughput time of 900 seconds and waiting time of 600 seconds.

To address these issues, I recommend the following data-driven actions:
- For Risk Review, allocate additional staff resources to handle the 480 cases, reducing waiting time.
- For Credit Assessment, implement automated tools to streamline verification for the 1175 cases, cutting throughput time.
- For Legal Approval, prioritize cases nearing the 600-second waiting threshold among the 465 cases, ensuring SLA compliance.

Sincerely,  
Senior Process-Performance Analyst
