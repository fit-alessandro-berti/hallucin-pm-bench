a) Decision points  
1. Tri-Color-Risk-Check gate – combines Cyan, Magenta and Yellow scorecards into a single risk rating of Low, Medium or High.  
2. Amount-and-risk branch – if risk is Low or Medium and the requested loan ≤ €250 k, Manual-Underwriting-Review is skipped; otherwise it is executed.  
3. TriVote gate – the proposal passes if any two of Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison and Sustainability Officer approve it.

b) Documents, first-appearance order  
Form 14B → Deck Memo (only if manual review is triggered) → Offer Sheet 77 → Signed Offer Sheet 77 → ID Matrix Declaration → Loan Dossier 2025
