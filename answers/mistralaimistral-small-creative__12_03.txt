**Answer:** **No**

**Justification:**
The FACT claims that **"Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," with no other activities in between.** However, the log excerpt contains **two counterexamples**:

1. **CaseID C002**:
   - Sequence: `Receive_Order` → **Pack_Items** → `Validate_Payment`
   - Here, `Validate_Payment` occurs **after** `Pack_Items`, not immediately after `Receive_Order`.

2. **CaseID C004**:
   - Sequence: `Receive_Order` → **Check_Fraud** → `Validate_Payment`
   - Here, `Validate_Payment` occurs **after** `Check_Fraud`, not immediately after `Receive_Order`.

Thus, the FACT is **incorrect** based on the provided log.
