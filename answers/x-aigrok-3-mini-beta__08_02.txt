**Question 1.** Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3 in a reachable marking.

**Question 2.** Minimal firing sequence: [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5].  
This sequence starts from M0, fires T1 to enable P2, then enables P5 via T2, T7, and T4, allowing T5 to fire while P2 is still available and before T3 consumes it. (42 words)
