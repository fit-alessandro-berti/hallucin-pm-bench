**Answer:** No  

**Justification:**  
The claim that “Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between” is contradicted by the evidence in the log:

- **Case C002**: The sequence is  
  `Receive_Order` → **`Pack_Items`** → `Validate_Payment`.  
  Here, `Pack_Items` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, violating the “immediately after” condition.

- **Case C004**: The sequence is  
  `Receive_Order` → **`Check_Fraud`** → `Validate_Payment`.  
  Here, `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, again violating the condition.

Thus, in both C002 and C004, activities other than `Validate_Payment` occur directly after `Receive_Order`, disproving the stated fact.
