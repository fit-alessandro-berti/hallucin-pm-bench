Add a **48‑hour boundary timer event** on the “Check Completeness” task (ID Task_Check). Attach the timer as a non‑interrupting boundary event; when the timer fires, route the flow directly to “Triage Claim” (ID Task_Triage). Keep the existing flow (f4‑f6) for claims that become complete before the deadline, but the timer guarantees that any claim still waiting (e.g., for missing documents) will be auto‑escalated to Triage after 48 hours, satisfying the SLA without adding new tasks.
