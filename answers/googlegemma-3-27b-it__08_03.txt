Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

Firing sequence: **T1, T2b, T4, T5**

Explanation:

1. **T1** fires, placing tokens in `pa` and `pb`.  Marking: `pa=1, pb=1`.
2. **T2b** fires, placing a token in `pd`. Marking: `pd=1, pb=1`.
3. **T4** fires, placing a token in `pe`. Marking: `pd=1, pe=1`.
4. **T5** fires, placing a token in `pf`. Marking: `pf=1`.

At this point, T5 has fired, but T3 has not.  T3 requires a token in `pc`, which has not yet been created in this firing sequence. Therefore T5 can fire before T3.
