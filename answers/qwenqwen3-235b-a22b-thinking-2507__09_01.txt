1) The requested average cycle time for "Review Contract" **cannot be derived** from the provided data.  

2) **Explanation**: The event log explicitly states that *timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted*. Cycle time calculations require duration data (e.g., timestamps to compute time between activity start/completion). No time-related fields are present in the log excerpt, and the historical benchmarks provided:  
   - Reference **different activities** ("Receive Renewal Request", "Negotiate Terms", "Legal Sign-off")  
   - Are from a **different customer segment** (FY-2023, not this log)  
   - **Do not include "Review Contract"** durations at all  
Thus, no calculation is possible with the given information.
