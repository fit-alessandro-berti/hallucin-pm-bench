Here’s the RACI matrix for FinCo’s order-to-cash workflow, strictly adhering to the preferred terminology:

| **Activity**          | **Account Manager (AM)** | **Compliance Officer (CO)** | **Finance Clerk (FC)** | **IT Support (IT)** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Receive Application   | **R**                    |                             |                        |                      |
| KYC Review            |                          | **R**                       |                        |                      |
| Order Vetting         | **R**                    |                             |                        |                      |
| Payment Clearance     |                          |                             | **R**                  |                      |
| Record Update         |                          |                             |                        | **R**                |
| Notify Customer       | **R**                    |                             |                        |                      |

**Key:**
- **R** = Responsible (performs the task)
- **A** = Accountable (owns the outcome)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)
- **I** = Informed (kept updated)

*Note:* For simplicity, this matrix assumes the **Account Manager (AM)** is **Accountable (A)** for the entire process unless otherwise specified. Adjust as needed for your governance model.
