Let's analyze the Petri net step-by-step from the initial marking.

**Initial Marking:** M0 = {p0:1}

**Possible transitions to fire from M0:**
Only T1 can fire as it's the only transition with 'p0' as an input place.

**Firing T1:**
*   Input consumed: p0
*   Output produced: pa, pb
*   New marking M1 = {pa:1, pb:1}

Now we are at M1 = {pa:1, pb:1}. We want to determine if T5 can fire before T3.

**To fire T5, its input places (pd and pe) must contain tokens.**

Let's see how tokens get to 'pd' and 'pe':

1.  **Token for 'pe':** `pe` can only get a token from T4.
2.  **Token for 'pd':** `pd` can get a token from T2b OR T3.

From M1 = {pa:1, pb:1}:

**Paths from M1:**

*   **Firing T4:**
    *   Input: pb
    *   Output: pe
    *   New marking M2_T4 = {pa:1, pe:1} (if T4 fires from M1)

*   **Firing T2:**
    *   Input: pa
    *   Output: pc
    *   New marking M2_T2 = {pb:1, pc:1} (if T2 fires from M1)

*   **Firing T2b (the "shortcut"):**
    *   Input: pa
    *   Output: pd
    *   New marking M2_T2b = {pb:1, pd:1} (if T2b fires from M1)

Let's consider the scenario where T5 fires as early as possible. This means we should take the "shortcut" T2b to get a token to 'pd' quickly.

**Sequence 1: T1 -> T2b -> T4**

1.  **T1 fires:** M0 = {p0:1} -> M1 = {pa:1, pb:1}
2.  **T2b fires:** (from pa) M1 -> M2_T2b = {pb:1, pd:1}
3.  **T4 fires:** (from pb) M2_T2b -> M3_T2b_T4 = {pd:1, pe:1}

At M3_T2b_T4 = {pd:1, pe:1}, **T5 is enabled** because it has tokens in both 'pd' and 'pe'.

Now, let's check the status of T3.
**To fire T3, its input place (pc) must contain a token.**

Looking back at how `pc` gets a token: `pc` only gets a token from T2.

In the firing sequence T1 -> T2b -> T4:
*   We chose to fire T2b, which consumed 'pa'.
*   Therefore, T2 cannot fire because its input 'pa' has been consumed.
*   If T2 cannot fire, then `pc` will *never* receive a token.
*   If `pc` never receives a token, then T3 can *never* fire.

Therefore, it is **possible** for T5 to fire *before* T3. In fact, in this specific sequence, T3 is never enabled.

**Answer:** Yes, it is possible.

**Shortest firing sequence:**

1.  **T1:** (p0 becomes empty, pa gets 1, pb gets 1)
    Marking: {pa:1, pb:1}
2.  **T2b:** (pa becomes empty, pd gets 1)
    Marking: {pb:1, pd:1}
3.  **T4:** (pb becomes empty, pe gets 1)
    Marking: {pd:1, pe:1}

At this point, T5 is enabled. T3 is NOT enabled (and cannot be enabled) as 'pc' cannot receive a token because 'pa' was consumed by T2b.

Therefore, T5 can fire *before* T3.

**One shortest firing sequence:**
T1, T2b, T4
