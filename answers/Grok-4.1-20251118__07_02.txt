### Added tasks
- Task_VerifyIdentity (Verify Identity) – inserted after the start event.
- Task_RequestDocs (Request Additional Documents) – new branch from the gateway.
- Task_FinalReject (Final Reject) – replaces the simple reject path.

### Removed tasks
- Task_RejectLoan (Reject Loan) – removed from the original "no" path.

### Gateway-type changes
- Gateway_Decision changed from exclusiveGateway (name: "Eligible?") to inclusiveGateway (name: "Eligibility Check").

(Note: Additional changes such as renamed tasks (e.g., "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan"), modified sequence flow names/labels, and altered process structure/topology are not reported here as they fall outside the three requested headings.)
