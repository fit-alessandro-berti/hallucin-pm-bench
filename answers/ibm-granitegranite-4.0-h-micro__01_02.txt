**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – Determine if the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by **≤ 2 points**.  
2. **Amount Threshold Decision** – Decide whether to proceed based on the loan amount: **< €15 000** automatically approves; **≥ €15 000** requires further action.  
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – Decide whether to **approve** or **reject** the loan after the underwriter alignment and amount assessment.
