**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Top Performance Gaps  

Identifying the three worst-performing activities:

1.  **Request_Documents** (Worst #1)
    *   **Why:** Excessive wait time (150 min) due to the second-highest volume (190/day), coupled with a high rework rate (22%) triggered by the process's highest SLA breach percentage (5.5%).
    *   **Action:** Automate the first notice of loss (eFNO) workflow to accept documents immediately, reducing queue pressure and manual entry errors.

2.  **Review_Documents** (Worst #2)
    *   **Why:** Highest processing variability (stdev 9 min) and highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), causing a 30-minute wait.
    *   **Action:** Deploy an OCR tool for automated document completeness checks before human review to standardize and speed up the process.

3.  **Initial_Assessment** (Worst #3)
    *   **Why:** High backlog-driven wait time (18 min) and the second-highest SLA breach rate (3.2%).
    *   **Action:** Implement a dynamic routing rule based on claim complexity to prioritize low-risk cases for automated processing.

**Next Steps:** Requesting budget for the automation of `Request_Documents` for immediate impact.
