**MEMORANDUM**

**TO**: Chief Operating Officer
**FROM**: [Your Name], Senior Process-Mining Analyst
**DATE**: October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT**: Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Remediation

Analysis of claim-handling data reveals three key areas for improvement based on waiting times:

1.  **Request Documents**: Average wait: 36.5 hours; 95th percentile: 120 hours. *Recommendation:* Implement automated document requests for common claim types, pre-populating forms to cut waiting time by ≥ 20 %.
2.  **Send Closure Letter**: Average wait: 12.2 hours; 95th percentile: 44.0 hours. *Recommendation:* Trigger closure letters automatically upon payment approval or claim rejection, eliminating manual scheduling and potentially dropping wait times by ≥ 20 %.
3.  **Assess Liability**: Average wait: 7.8 hours; 95th percentile: 16.4 hours. *Recommendation:* Implement an expert system to auto-classify claims by risk/complexity, routing simple cases for faster assessment. This should reduce waiting time by ≥ 20 %.
