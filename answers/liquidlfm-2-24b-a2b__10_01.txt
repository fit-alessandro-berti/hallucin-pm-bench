| Activity / Step                     | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application                 | **R**                |                          |                    |                 |
| Customer Due Diligence (KYC Review) |                      | **R**                    |                    |                 |
| Order Vetting (Order Validation)    | **R**                |                          | **R**              |                 |
| Payment Clearance                   |                      |                          | **R**              |                 |
| Record Update                       |                      |                          |                    | **R**           |
| Notify Customer                     | **R**                |                          |                    | **A**           |

**Key**  
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)  
- **A** = Accountable (owns the outcome)  
- Blank = Not involved  

**Notes**  
- The Account Manager owns the end‑to‑end flow, ensuring each step is completed before moving forward.  
- The Compliance Officer performs the KYC Review once documents are received, then hands off to the Account Manager for Order Vetting.  
- The Finance Clerk initiates Payment Clearance and updates records, while IT Support refreshes the CRM after the final step.  
- Notification of the customer is the Account Manager’s final responsibility, with IT Support providing the technical support needed for the email to be sent reliably.  

This matrix aligns with the organization’s preferred terminology and clearly defines who does what at each stage.
