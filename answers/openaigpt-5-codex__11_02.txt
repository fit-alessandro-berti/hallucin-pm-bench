**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Priority Fixes  

1. **Request_Documents** – Throughput collapses to 190 cases/day from 270 upstream, while customers wait 150 minutes before a 5-minute task; rework spikes to 22% and SLA breaches to 5.5%. **Action:** Stand up a dedicated document-intake cell with automated reminder triggers to clear the queue and cut repeat requests, targeting <60 minutes wait and <10% rework within next quarter.  

2. **Review_Documents** – Average processing stretches to 25 minutes with high variability (σ = 9), keeping 185 cases/day stuck another 30 minutes and driving the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%). **Action:** Introduce a two-tier review (fast-track for standard submissions) and deploy a checklist to standardize complex reviews, aiming to halve variability and reduce SLA breaches below 5%.  

3. **Initial_Assessment** – Wait times of 18 minutes immediately after registration indicate insufficient assessor capacity; rework (1.8%) and SLA breaches (3.2%) also rise versus other early steps. **Action:** Rebalance staffing by shifting one FTE from Register_Claim coverage to Initial_Assessment during peak hours, supported by queue monitoring, to bring waits under 10 minutes and cut SLA breaches below 2%.
