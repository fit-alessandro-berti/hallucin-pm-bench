The fact is **INACCURATE** with respect to the event-log fragment.

Justification:
- In Case 1001: "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02), not after.
- In Case 1002: "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all in this case.
- In Case 1003: "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18), not after.

The data shows that when both activities occur in the same case, "Update_Inventory" actually precedes "Authorize_Refund", which is the opposite of what the fact claims.
