# MEMORANDUM

**To:** Chief Operating Officer, Acme Insurance
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Three Priority Performance Issues

---

Three activities demand immediate intervention.

**1. Request\_Documents** is the primary bottleneck. Its 150-minute average wait time is five times that of any other activity, and a 22% rework rate—the highest by a wide margin—signals that requests are routinely incomplete, forcing repeated cycles. This is where throughput visibly collapses, falling from 270 to 190 cases per day.
**Action:** Mandate a standardised digital document checklist at the point of request to eliminate ambiguous submissions and cut rework loops.

**2. Review\_Documents** carries the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and the longest processing time (25 min), with a standard deviation of 9 minutes indicating deeply inconsistent execution.
**Action:** Introduce structured review templates with mandatory completeness criteria to compress and stabilise processing time.

**3. Initial\_Assessment** exhibits the third-highest SLA breach rate (3.2%), an 18-minute wait, and a 1.8% rework rate, pointing to queue pressure relative to capacity.
**Action:** Conduct a demand-versus-capacity analysis; implement priority-based triage or add assessor capacity if queues consistently exceed SLA tolerance.

Resolving these three activities addresses both the throughput drop and the majority of SLA failures across the process.
