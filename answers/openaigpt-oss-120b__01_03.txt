**a) Decision points (gates / conditional branches)**  

| # | Decision point | Rule (one‑sentence description) |
|---|----------------|---------------------------------|
| 1 | **Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check branch** – after the risk rating is produced, the process continues to Manual‑Underwriting‑Review **only if** the rating is **High** **or** the requested amount **exceeds €250 000**; otherwise it skips step 5. |
| 2 | **TriVote gate** – the loan passes the gate when **any two of the three required approvals** (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) are obtained; the third approval is optional. |

*(No other internal decision gates are defined in prescribed workflow.)*  

---

**b) Documents required (in the order they first appear)**  

1. **Form 14B** – received with the loan application (Step 1).  
2. **Deck Memo** – prepared during Manual‑Underwriting‑Review (Step 5) *if* that step is executed.  
3. **Offer Sheet 77** – created when the binding offer is prepared (Step 7).  
4. **ID Matrix Declaration** – submitted together with the signed Offer Sheet 77 as part of the applicant‑confirmation (Step 8).  
5. **Loan Dossier 2025** – compiled to finalize the agreement (Step 9).  

*Note:* The three scorecards (Scorecard‑Cyan, Scorecard‑Magenta, Scorecard‑Yellow) are inputs to the risk check but are not treated as “documents” in the sense of deliverables required by the process.
