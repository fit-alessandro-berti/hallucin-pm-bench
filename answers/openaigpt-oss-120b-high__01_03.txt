**a) Decision points (gates / conditional branches)**  

| # | Decision point | Rule (one‑sentence description) |
|---|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | **Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check** | The applicant’s three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) are combined to produce a single risk rating of **Low, Medium, or High**. |
| 2 | **Conditional branch – “skip manual underwriting”** | If the computed risk rating is **Low or Medium** **and** the requested loan amount is **≤ €250 000**, the process jumps past the Manual‑Underwriting‑Review step; otherwise the review is performed. |
| 3 | **TriVote decision gate** | The loan passes the gate when **any two of the three required approvers** – Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer – give their approval. |

*(No other explicit gates exist in the defined workflow; steps such as “Request‑Applicant‑Confirmation” and “Finalize‑Agreement” are procedural, not decisions.)*

**b) Documents required (in the order they first appear)**  

1. **Form 14B** – received with the loan application (Step 1).  
2. **Deck Memo** – produced for the Manual‑Underwriting‑Review (Step 5).  
3. **Offer Sheet 77** – prepared as the binding offer (Step 7).  
4. **Signed Offer Sheet 77** – the applicant’s signed copy returned for confirmation (Step 8).  
5. **ID Matrix Declaration** – submitted together with the signed offer (Step 8).  
6. **Loan Dossier 2025** – the final loan agreement package (Step 9).  

These are the only documents referenced in Acme Bank’s small‑business loan‑approval process.
