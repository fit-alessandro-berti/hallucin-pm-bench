I cannot calculate the average cycle time for "Review Contract" from the given data.

Explanation:
While we can see that "Review Contract" appears in several cases (C-001, C-002, C-003, C-004), the log header doesn't include any timestamp or elapsed-time information. The data shows only case_id, activity, and resource columns. Without timing information, it's impossible to calculate the average cycle time of any activity.

Even though we have historical benchmarks for some activities, these are from a different customer segment and time period, so they cannot be used to determine the cycle time for "Review Contract" in this specific log.
