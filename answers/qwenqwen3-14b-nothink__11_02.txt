**Executive Memo – Claims Handling Process Performance (Q1-2025)**  

The three worst-performing activities in the claims handling process are **Review_Documents**, **Request_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.  

**Review_Documents** has the highest **sla_breach_pct (12.4%)** and **stdev_processing_time_min (9)**, indicating inconsistent and often delayed performance.  
**Request_Documents** exhibits the highest **rework_rate_pct (22.0%)**, suggesting frequent resubmissions and process inefficiencies, while also having a **long avg_wait_time_min (150)**.  
**Initial_Assessment** has a **high sla_breach_pct (3.2%)** and elevated **stdev_processing_time_min (4)**, signaling variability and potential bottlenecks.  

**Recommendations**:  
- For **Review_Documents**, implement standardized checklists and AI-assisted triage to reduce variability and SLA breaches.  
- For **Request_Documents**, automate document tracking and set up proactive customer communication to reduce rework.  
- For **Initial_Assessment**, provide targeted training or process automation tools to stabilize processing times and improve SLA adherence.
