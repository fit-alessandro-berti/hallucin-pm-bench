**Decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight‑refund process**

| Decision point | What is decided? | Subsequent path |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** | Is the claim eligible (checked against *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*)? | If yes → move to Finance_Controller_PreApprove; if no → claim is denied. |
| **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** | Does the finance controller approve the claim? | If yes → proceed to high‑value check; if no → claim is denied. |
| **High‑value check** (implicit step) | Is the refund amount **> €1 000**? | If yes → case goes to Senior_Auditor_Review; if no → skip to Process_Refund_Payment. |
