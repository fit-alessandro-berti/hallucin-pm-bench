Add a **timer boundary event** to `Task_Receive`, `Task_Check`, and `Task_RequestDocs` (if reachable within 48h) to enforce the 48-hour SLA to reach `Task_Triage`. However, since only one improvement is allowed and to keep it minimal: attach a **timer boundary event (48h)** to `Task_Receive` (ID: `Task_Receive`) that interrupts the normal flow and directly routes to `Task_Triage` if the 48-hour deadline expires. This ensures claims auto-escalate to triage within SLA without adding new tasks—only a timer event and one additional sequence flow to `Task_Triage`.
