Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking specifically about Process B, which is the Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing process. They want to know all the sets of tasks that can run concurrently based on the description provided. 

First, I need to look at Process B carefully. The process is outlined with several steps, some of which are in parallel blocks. The key here is to identify these parallel blocks and list the tasks within them that can be executed at the same time. The user also mentioned to exclude any tasks that must run sequentially, so I’ll need to focus only on the parallel parts.

Let me break down Process B step by step:

1. **Accept_Custom_Order** – This is the first step and it's sequential because there's no indication it's part of a parallel block.
   
2. **(Parallel Block P1)** – The description shows this as a parallel block with two tasks: 
   - **Generate_CAD_Drawing**
   - **Confirm_Materials_Availability**
   Both of these can run concurrently, as indicated by the double pipes (`||`) meaning parallel execution.

3. **Once P1 completes → (Parallel Block P2)** – After P1 is done, another parallel block (P2) starts with three tasks:
   - **Milling_Panels**
   - **Turning_Legs**
   - **CNC_Detailing**
   Again, all three can be done simultaneously.

4. **Dry_Fit_Assembly** – Sequential step.
5. **Glue_And_Clamp** – Sequential step.

6. **(Parallel Block P3)** – Then there's another parallel block (P3) with three tasks:
   - **Sand_Surfaces**
   - **Apply_Stain**
   - **Install_Hardware**
   All three of these can be done in parallel.

7. **Final_Inspection** – The last step, which is sequential.

The user specifically asked to list sets of tasks that can be executed concurrently. So, each parallel block (P1, P2, P3) should be listed separately. Each line should list the tasks within one parallel block, separated by commas.

I need to ensure that tasks from Processes A and C are not included, which they aren't here since we're only talking about Process B. Also, tasks that aren't in a parallel block should be excluded from the list since they run sequentially.

So, identifying the parallels:
- **P1:** Two tasks.
- **P2:** Three tasks.
- **P3:** Three tasks.

Now, I'll format the answer as numbered lines, each line corresponding to one parallel block with tasks separated by commas. I won't include any sequential tasks or mention other processes.

One more thing to double-check: The description uses "||" to denote parallel tasks, which confirms that within each block, the tasks can run concurrently. Also, the instruction says "may execute concurrently according to the description," so as long as the description allows it, even if in practice they might sometimes run sequentially, we list them.

Let me make sure I didn't miss any other parallel blocks or incorrectly include sequential tasks. Nope, only P1, P2, and P3 are the parallel blocks.
1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware
