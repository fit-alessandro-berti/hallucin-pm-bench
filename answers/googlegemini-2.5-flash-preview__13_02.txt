3. A low-support activity like "Manual_Fraud_Check" can mislead performance or predictive analyses because its infrequent appearance in this small sample might not represent its true frequency or impact in the overall process. Metrics or models built on this limited data might underestimate its role, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions about process bottlenecks, resource allocation, or factors influencing claim outcomes. Larger datasets are needed for representative analysis.
