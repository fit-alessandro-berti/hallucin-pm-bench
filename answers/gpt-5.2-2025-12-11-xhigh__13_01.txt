1) **“Manual_Fraud_Check” occurrences:** **1** time.

2) **Percentage of all logged events:**  
Total events in fragment = **18**.  
\( 1 / 18 \times 100 = 5.555...\% \) → **5.56%**

3) **Case(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”:** **A1002**

4) **Two sampling-related reasons the monthly estimate is unreliable (using only this fragment):**
- **Too little time coverage:** all events shown occur on **a single date (2025-05-01)** within roughly **09:00–14:05**, so it may not represent typical behavior across an entire month (day-to-day/week-to-week variation is not captured).
- **Too small / potentially non-representative sample:** only **4 cases (A1001–A1004)** are included, and nothing indicates they were randomly sampled; the observed manual-check rate could easily be unrepresentative of the broader population of cases in a month.
