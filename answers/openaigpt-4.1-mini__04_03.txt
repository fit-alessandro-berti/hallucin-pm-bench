Trace 2025-05-RX17 details:  
- severity = "High"  
- sequence of activities:  
  1. create_case  
  2. capture_event_details  
  3. Quality_Engineer_Review (QE)  
  4. Notify_Authorities (NA)  
  5. Regulatory_Affairs_Review (RA)  
  6. VP_Safety_Approval (VP)  
  7. Close_Case (CC)

---

**Rule Analysis:**  

1. **QE and RA must occur once each and in that order**  
   - QE occurs at position 3  
   - RA occurs at position 5  
   - RA occurs **after** QE ✅  
   - Satisfied.

2. **If severity = "High", VP must happen after both QE and RA**  
   - VP is at position 6  
   - QE at 3, RA at 5  
   - VP is after both QE and RA ✅  
   - Satisfied.

3. **Notify_Authorities (NA) must not occur until after QE and RA are complete**  
   - NA occurs at position 4, before RA at 5  
   - Thus, NA occurs before RA is complete ❌  
   - Violated.

4. **Close_Case (CC) may occur only after NA (and after VP if required)**  
   - CC at 7, NA at 4, VP at 6  
   - CC after both NA and VP ✅  
   - Satisfied.

**Conclusion:**  
The trace violates Rule 3 because `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete. Therefore, the trace is **non-compliant** with the ruleset.

---

**Answer:** No.  
Rule 3 is violated because `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is done. While rules 1, 2, and 4 are satisfied, this breach makes the trace non-compliant.
