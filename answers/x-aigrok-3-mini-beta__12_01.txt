No, the fact is not accurate based on the event-log fragment.

Justification:  
- In Case 1001, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund" (specifically, "Update_Inventory" at 2025-03-01 08:25:55, followed by "Authorize_Refund" at 2025-03-01 08:30:02).  
- In Case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all, though "Authorize_Refund" is present (at 2025-03-02 10:18:40).  
- In Case 1003, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund" (at 2025-03-03 10:08:07 and 2025-03-03 10:22:18, respectively), with "Quality_Check" in between, so they are not immediate.

In none of the cases does "Authorize_Refund" occur immediately before "Update_Inventory," as required by the claim.
