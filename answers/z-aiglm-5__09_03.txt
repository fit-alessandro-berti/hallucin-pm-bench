It is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95 % confidence interval because Artefact A explicitly redacts all timestamp values and data rows, leaving only the header structure. Calculating the duration of the "Approve Invoice" activity requires the specific `start_time` and `complete_time` entries for every instance of that activity, which are not present in the supplied log. Artefact B only provides a historical average throughput time between two distinct activities, which does not allow for the derivation of the specific activity duration requested.
