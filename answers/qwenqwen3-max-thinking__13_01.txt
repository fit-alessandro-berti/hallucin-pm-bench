1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.  

2. There are 18 total logged events.  
   Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ **5.56%**  

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is: **A1002**  

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:  
   - **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 18 events across 4 cases, which is insufficient to generalize to monthly activity.  
   - **Limited time window**: All events occur on a single day (2025-05-01), so it does not capture potential day-to-day or week-to-week variability in fraud check frequency.
