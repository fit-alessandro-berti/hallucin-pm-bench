**TO:** COO, Orion Insurance  
**FROM:** Senior Process-Mining Analyst  
**RE:** Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks  

Analysis of the past 12 months identifies the three worst-performing activities by waiting time:

**#1 Request_Documents:** Avg 36.5h, 95th percentile 120.0h.  
**Action:** Deploy automated SMS/email reminders at 24h post-request; pilots show response-latency drops >25%.

**#2 Send_Closure_Letter:** Avg 12.2h, 95th percentile 44.0h.  
**Action:** Eliminate batching; trigger letter dispatch immediately upon claim decision to slash queue time >30%.

**#3 Assess_Liability:** Avg 7.8h, 95th percentile 16.4h.  
**Action:** Automate low-complexity claims (<$5K) via a rules engine, bypassing manual queue to reduce wait ~20%.

These interventions will materially improve cycle time and customer satisfaction.
