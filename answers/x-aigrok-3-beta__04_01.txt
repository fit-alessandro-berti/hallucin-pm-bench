Non-compliant

Justification:
1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains the activity `Expedite_Flag`, which mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at position 8 (2025-05-06 09:40), while `Risk_Assessment` occurs at position 9 (2025-05-06 10:31). Since `Risk_Assessment` happens after `Ship_Goods`, this violates the rule.
2. **Rule 3 violation**: After the activity `Goods_Received` at position 6 (2025-05-06 08:44), the activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). In this trace, `Three_way_match` occurs at position 10 (2025-05-06 11:52), which is 4 positions after `Goods_Received`, exceeding the allowed distance of 2 activities. Thus, this violates the rule.

Note: Other rules (1, 4, and 5) are satisfied:
- Rule 1: The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, and the trace shows two approvals (`Approve_PO` by Procurement Officer at position 2 and `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO at position 3) before `Issue_PO` at position 5.
- Rule 4: No activity executed by an Intern directly follows an activity executed by the CFO. The CFO's activity is at position 3, followed by `Expedite_Flag` by System at position 4.
- Rule 5: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` at position 11, with no activities following it. 

However, due to the violations of Rules 2 and 3, the trace is deemed non-compliant.
