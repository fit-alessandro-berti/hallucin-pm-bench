Non-compliant.
1.  Rule 2 is violated: Activity `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurred *after* the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods` (event 8), despite `Expedite_Flag` (event 4) being present in the trace, which mandates `Risk_Assessment` to occur *before* `Ship_Goods`.
2.  Rule 3 is violated: Activity `Three_way_match` (event 10) occurred at a distance of 4 activities after `Goods_Received` (event 6). The rule requires `Three_way_match` to be completed within the next two activities (distance â‰¤ 2) after `Goods_Received`.
