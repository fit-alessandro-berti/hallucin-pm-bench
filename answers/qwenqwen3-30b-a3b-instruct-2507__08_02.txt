**Question 1:** No, T5 cannot fire before T3.

**Explanation:** T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. P5 is only produced by T4, which consumes P4. P4 is produced by both T3 (from P2) and T7 (from P3). However, to enable T5, P2 must be marked *after* T3 has fired (since T3 consumes P2). But T5 requires P2 *before* T3 fires—creating a circular dependency. Thus, T5 cannot fire before T3. T3 must fire to free P2 *after* T5’s prerequisite (P5) is met. No valid sequence allows T5 before T3.
