1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1 time** in this excerpt (Case 1002 at 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because:

- **Sample size**: This excerpt contains only 3 cases from March 1st, representing a tiny fraction of a month-long log
- **Time-of-day bias**: All events occur between 09:02-10:45 UTC on a single day, which may not represent patterns across different shifts, weekdays, or weekends
- **Naming inconsistencies**: The log shows three different activity names for fraud checks ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Manual Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), suggesting potential data quality issues that could hide or misrepresent manual checks elsewhere in the full log
- **Temporal clustering**: Early-month transactions might have different characteristics than mid or end-of-month volumes
