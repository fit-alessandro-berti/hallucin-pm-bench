The FACT is inaccurate. Evidence from the log:  
- **Case C002**: `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` (09:50) → `Validate_Payment` (10:05). *Pack_Items* occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.  
- **Case C004**: `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` (10:07) → `Validate_Payment` (10:20). *Check_Fraud* occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.  

In both cases, other activities directly precede `Validate_Payment`, violating the claim that it "always occurs immediately after `Receive_Order` with no other activities in between."
