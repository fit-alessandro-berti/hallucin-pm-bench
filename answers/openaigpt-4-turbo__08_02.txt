**Answer 1:** No, transition T5 cannot fire before transition T3.

**Answer 2:** Transition T3 moves a token from P2 to P4. For transition T5 to fire, it requires tokens in both P2 and P5. Transition T4, which moves a token from P4 to P5, can only occur after transition T3 has placed a token in P4 from P2. This is because P4 starts empty, and the only transitions that add a token to P4 are T3 and T7. Since T7 requires a token in P3 (via T2 from P1), and T1 initializes both P1 and P2, token at P4 from T3 must precede or be simultaneous to the token from T7. Hence, T3 must fire before T5 can occur.
