Executive Memo for Orion's COO  
Subject: Process-Performance Analysis of Key Activities  

Dear [COO's Name],  

As Orion’s senior process-performance analyst, I’ve analyzed the provided data to identify the three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches (Avg_Throughput_Time > Target_SLA) and high waiting times (Avg_Waiting_Time). The three activities, ranked by excess SLA violation and waiting time impact, are:  

1. **Risk Review**: Exceeds SLA by 300s (Avg_Throughput_Time: 600s vs. Target: 300s)—highest excess and highest waiting time (480s).  
2. **Legal Approval**: Exceeds SLA by 300s (Avg_Throughput_Time: 900s vs. Target: 600s)—second highest excess and highest waiting time (600s).  
3. **Credit Assessment**: Exceeds SLA by 60s (Avg_Throughput_Time: 300s vs. Target: 240s)—third highest excess.  

Recommendations (bullet points only):  
- Conduct a process audit of Risk Review to eliminate redundant steps (e.g., manual document checks) and automate repetitive tasks, reducing Avg_Throughput_Time by 25-30%.  
- Use predictive analytics to prioritize Legal Approval cases based on urgency/complexity, cutting Avg_Throughput_Time by 20-25%.  
- Standardize Credit Assessment criteria and automate credit report data extraction, decreasing Avg_Throughput_Time by 30%.  

These actions are data-driven and target the root causes of SLA breaches and high waiting times.  

Thank you for your attention.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
