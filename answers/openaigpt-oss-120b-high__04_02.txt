**R1:** Compliant – Manager_Approval on 03‑03 preceded Finance_Approval on 03‑04, satisfying required sequence.  
**R2:** Compliant – Ship_Goods on 03‑05 occurs within two days after Finance_Approval on 03‑04.  
**R3:** Violated – Pay_Invoice on 03‑06 is earlier than Receive_Goods on 03‑07.  
**R4:** Not Applicable – hazardous = false, so Safety_Inspection not required.  
**R5:** Violated – Change_Request on 03‑04 precedes Ship_Goods; no new Manager_Approval before that step.  
**R6:** Compliant – Case ends with Archive_Record event, fulfilling termination requirement.  

**Overall Result:** NON-COMPLIANT
