Okay, I will answer your questions based solely on the provided XES log excerpt.

1.  The activity **"Manual\_Fraud\_Check"** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt.

2.  *   a) Percentage of all *events* that include it:  1 / 48 = 0.020833. Therefore the answer is **2.08%**.
    *   b) Percentage of all *unique cases* that include it:  1 / 12 = 0.083333. Therefore the answer is **8.33%**.

3.  A low-support activity like "Manual\_Fraud\_Check," appearing in only 8.33% of cases, can skew analyses if generalised. Its infrequent occurrence might lead to underestimation of its impact on overall process performance (e.g., cycle time) or inaccurate predictions if its presence strongly influences specific outcomes. The data is a small sample, making it harder to reliably discern its true effect within the broader Claim-Payout process.
