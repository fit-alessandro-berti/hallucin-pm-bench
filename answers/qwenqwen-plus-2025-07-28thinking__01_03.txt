### a) Decision Points Summary  
*(Only steps where workflow direction changes based on conditions/rules)*  

1. **Step 4 Conditional Branch**  
   *Rule:* Skip Manual-Underwriting-Review **if and only if** the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome is **Low or Medium** **AND** the requested loan amount is **≤ €250,000**; otherwise, proceed to Step 5.  

2. **Step 6 "TriVote" Gate**  
   *Rule:* Loan passes if **at least two out of three** mandatory approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) grant approval; a single rejection fails the gate.  

*(Note: Steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 involve document handling or processing but contain no conditional logic or voting decisions.)*

### b) Required Documents (in order of first appearance)  
1. **Form 14B** (Step 1: Receive-Application)  
2. **Deck Memo** (Step 5: Manual-Underwriting-Review – *only required if Step 4’s condition fails*)  
3. **Offer Sheet 77** (Step 7: Prepare-Binding-Offer)  
4. **ID Matrix Declaration** (Step 8: Request-Applicant-Confirmation – submitted *alongside* signed Offer Sheet 77)  
5. **Loan Dossier 2025** (Step 9: Finalize-Agreement)  

#### Key Clarifications:  
- **No KYC/AML documents** are required (outsourced per process note).  
- **Scorecard inputs (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow)** are internal data sources, **not** applicant-submitted documents.  
- **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (Step 8) references the same document as **Offer Sheet 77** (Step 7), so it appears once in the list.  
- **Deck Memo** is conditional but appears in the sequence when Step 5 is triggered (i.e., if risk = *High* **or** amount > €250,000).  

> ✅ Verified against process description: All 5 documents listed match Acme’s defined workflow. Sustainability Officer’s approval (Step 6) requires no *new* document beyond the **Deck Memo** (if applicable) or **Offer Sheet 77**.
