Based solely on the provided event-log fragment, the fact is **inaccurate**.  

### Justification:  
- **Case 1001**:  
  - `Authorize_Refund` (4th activity) occurs **after** `Update_Inventory` (3rd activity).  
  - Immediately after `Authorize_Refund`, the next activity is `Refund_Issued` (5th activity), not `Update_Inventory`.  

- **Case 1003**:  
  - `Authorize_Refund` (5th activity) occurs **after** `Update_Inventory` (3rd activity).  
  - Immediately after `Authorize_Refund`, there is no subsequent activity (end of case), and `Update_Inventory` precedes it non-adjacently.  

### Conclusion:  
The log shows no instance where `Authorize_Refund` occurs immediately before `Update_Inventory`. In both cases where both activities exist (1001, 1003), the order is reversed or non-adjacent. Case 1002 lacks `Update_Inventory` entirely, so it does not support the claim.
