No.  
Rule 2 is violated: Since severity is "High," `VP_Safety_Approval` must occur after both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`. However, the trace shows `VP_Safety_Approval` appears **after** both reviews, but no evidence confirms completion of both reviews before VP was initiatedâ€”missing internal validation or completion tracking for QE and RA. Rule 1 requires both QE and RA to occur **once each and in order**, but no explicit sequence or confirmation of completion is recorded before `VP_Safety_Approval`. Hence, completion and order of QE and RA are insufficiently verified, breaching compliance.
