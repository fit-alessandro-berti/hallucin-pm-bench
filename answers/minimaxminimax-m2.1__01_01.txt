# Contoso Airlines Flight-Refund Process: Decision Points and Required Documents

## Decision Points

The Contoso Airlines process contains three distinct decision points where workflow routing is determined:

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** — The triage agent evaluates whether the claim meets eligibility criteria based on the FlightManifest and WeatherReport. This validation determines whether the claim proceeds forward or is potentially rejected.

2. **High-Value Threshold Check** — If the refund amount exceeds €1 000, the process branches to require Senior_Auditor_Review. This amount-based decision creates a mandatory high-value pathway that does not exist for standard-value claims.

3. **Process_Refund_Payment Prerequisites** — The payment phase can only commence after Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded, plus the additional requirement that Senior_Auditor_Review has been completed for all high-value claims. This gatekeeping decision ensures proper authorization sequencing.

## Required Documents

Seven documents are mandated throughout the process lifecycle:

| Document | Activity Where Required |
|----------|------------------------|
| RefundRequestForm | Customer_Submit_Claim |
| FlightManifest | Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility |
| WeatherReport | Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility |
| EligibilityChecklist | Finance_Controller_PreApprove |
| AuditTrail | Senior_Auditor_Review (high-value only) |
| BankTransferAuthorization | Process_Refund_Payment |
| RefundConfirmationPDF | Issue_Confirmation_Letter |

Note that the AuditTrail is required exclusively for high-value claims exceeding €1 000, while all other documents apply universally across all refund claims regardless of amount.
