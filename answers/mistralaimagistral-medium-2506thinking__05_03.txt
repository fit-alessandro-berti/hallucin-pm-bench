### Solution

The addition of a boundary timer event and an escalation flow enforces the SLA compliance by triggering an existing unused activity if the deadline isn't met. Here are the necessary XML changes:

```xml
<bpmn:boundaryEvent id="Boundary_Timer_01" name="SLA Escalation Timer" attachedToRef="Activity_CreateAccount">
  <bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
    <bpmn:timeDuration xsi:type="bpmn:tExpression">PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>
  </bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
</bpmn:boundaryEvent>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_Escalation_01" sourceRef="Boundary_Timer_01" targetRef="Activity_AMReview"/>
```

Justification â€“ This solution enforces the 48-hour SLA for "Create Account in Core System" by redirecting to an existing review activity if the deadline is breached, thus leveraging existing activities without introducing new ones.
