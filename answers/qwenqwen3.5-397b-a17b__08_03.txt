**Shortest firing sequence:**
T1, T2b, T4, T5

**Verification trace:**
1.  **Start:** $M_0 = \{p0: 1\}$
2.  **Fire T1:** Consumes $p0$, produces $pa, pb$. Marking: $\{pa: 1, pb: 1\}$
3.  **Fire T2b:** Consumes $pa$, produces $pd$. Marking: $\{pb: 1, pd: 1\}$ (Place $pc$ remains 0, so **T3 is not enabled**)
4.  **Fire T4:** Consumes $pb$, produces $pe$. Marking: $\{pd: 1, pe: 1\}$
5.  **Fire T5:** Consumes $pd, pe$, produces $pf$. Marking: $\{pf: 1\}$

In this sequence, **T5** fires at step 4, while **T3** never fires (as $pc$ is never marked). Thus, T5 fires before T3. The sequence length is 4, which is minimal because T1 is required to start, T5 is the target, and distinct transitions (T2b and T4) are required to generate the necessary tokens for $pd$ and $pe$ without using T3.
