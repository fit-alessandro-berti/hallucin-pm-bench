# Analysis of Petri Net PN-8

**Question 1:** Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Question 2:** A minimal firing sequence demonstrating this is:
T1, T2, T7, T4, T5

Explanation:
1. Initial marking: M0 = {P0(1)}
2. T1 fires: {P1(1), P2(1)}
3. T2 fires: {P2(1), P3(1)}
4. T7 fires: {P2(1), P4(1)}
5. T4 fires: {P2(1), P5(1)}
6. T5 fires: {P6(1)}

This sequence shows T5 firing before T3. After T1 fires, we have tokens in both P1 and P2. The token in P1 follows the path T2→T7→T4, producing a token in P5. Meanwhile, the token in P2 remains unused. When P5 has a token, T5 can fire using tokens from P2 and P5, all without ever firing T3.
