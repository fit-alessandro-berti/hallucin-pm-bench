 The fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment. The data shows that for case 1003, the activity "Authorize_Refund" does not occur immediately before "Update_Inventory". Instead, there is an additional activity "Quality_Check" between them. Therefore, the statement does not hold true for all cases in the event log.
