**Question 1:** No.

**Question 2:** Not applicable.

Explanation: T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. P5 is only marked by T4, which consumes the token in P4. P4 can be marked either by T7 (from P3) or T3 (from P2), but T3 must fire to enable P4 → P5 → T5. Since P2 is marked by T1 and no other transition produces a token in P2, T3 must fire to consume P2 and produce P4. Thus, T3 must fire before P4 is marked, hence before T4 and T5. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3. The structure enforces T3 before T5.
