### **Solution**

#### **Q1**: How many **distinct cases** are present in this fragment?

To determine distinct cases, we extract the values of the `case` attribute from the lines and count the unique ones:

- **Cases**: C001, C002, C003
- **Number of distinct cases**: **3**

#### **Q2**: For case “C002”, list the **sequence of activities** in the order they occurred.

From the log, lines corresponding to case `C002` are:`2.`, `5.`, `8.`, `10.`
Extracting the `concept:name` values in order:

- Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**Sequence**:

```csharp
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
```

#### **Q3**: Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”**.

To identify the preceding activities:

- Look at the activity (`concept:name`) on the line immediately before a `Ship_Order`.
- Check for lines containing `Ship_Order` and then inspect the previous line:

1. Line 7: `Ship_Order` (Preceded by line 6: `Check_Stock`)
2. Line 9: `Ship_Order` (Preceded by line 8: `Arrange_Delivery`)
3. Line 10: `Ship_Order` (Preceded by line 9: `Ship_Order`)

- Distinct activities preceding `Ship_Order`: Check_Stock, Arrange_Delivery

**List**:

- Check_Stock
- Arrange_Delivery
