No, the fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment.

Justification: Case 1003 shows that "Update_Inventory" occurs *after* "Authorize_Refund". Specifically, the sequence within case 1003 is: Receive_Return -> Inspect_Item -> Update_Inventory -> Quality_Check -> Authorize_Refund. Therefore, "Authorize_Refund" is not always immediately before "Update_Inventory".
