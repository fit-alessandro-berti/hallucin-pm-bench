The fact is not entirely accurate. The activity "Update_Inventory" is not present in every case where "Authorize_Refund" occurs; specifically, Case 1002 does not have the "Update_Inventory" activity, and therefore the statement cannot be universally applied to all cases represented in the given event-log fragment.

Justification:
- Case 1001: "Authorize_Refund" occurs before "Update_Inventory".
- Case 1002: "Authorize_Refund" occurs but "Update_Inventory" is absent.
- Case 1003: "Authorize_Refund" occurs before "Update_Inventory".

Conclusion:
While "Authorize_Refund" is present in the sequence before "Update_Inventory" in the first and third cases, the lack of "Update_Inventory" in Case 1002 shows that the provided statement does not hold true for the entire event-log fragment.
