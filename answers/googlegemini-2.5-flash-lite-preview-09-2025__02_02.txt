Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided XES event log fragment:

---

### Q1 How many **distinct cases** are present in this fragment?

To find the number of distinct cases, we look at the values in the `case` attribute: C001, C002, C001, C003, C002, C003, C001, C002, C003, C002.

The distinct cases are C001, C002, and C003.

**Answer:** 3

### Q2 For case **“C002”**, list the **sequence of activities** in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).

We filter the events for `case="C002"`, maintaining the temporal order (lines 2, 5, 8, 10):

1. Line 2: Receive\_Order
2. Line 5: Check\_Stock
3. Line 8: Arrange\_Delivery
4. Line 10: Ship\_Order

**Answer:** Receive\_Order $\rightarrow$ Check\_Stock $\rightarrow$ Arrange\_Delivery $\rightarrow$ Ship\_Order

---

### Q3 Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship\_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

We identify all events immediately preceding "Ship\_Order":

*   Line 7 (C001): Preceded by `Check_Stock` (Line 3).
*   Line 8 (C002): Preceded by `Arrange_Delivery`.
*   Line 9 (C003): Preceded by `Check_Stock` (Line 6).
*   Line 10 (C002): Preceded by `Arrange_Delivery` (Line 8).

The distinct preceding activities are `Check_Stock` and `Arrange_Delivery`.

Ordering them alphabetically:

**Answer:**
Arrange\_Delivery
Check\_Stock
