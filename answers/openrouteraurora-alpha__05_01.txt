Add a **timer‑catch intermediate event** after the “Check Completeness” task and before the gateway, then route the timer‑expiry to an escalation end.  

1. Replace flow **f3** with two flows:  
   * **f3a** – source = Task_Check → target = Timer_48h (a new `<bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent id="Timer_48h" name="48‑h Timer">` with `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`).  
   * **f3b** – source = Timer_48h → target = GW_Docs.  

2. Add a **default flow** from Timer_48h to a new end event **Escalated** (id = End_Escalated) that is taken when the 48‑hour timer fires.  

All existing tasks stay unchanged; the timer guarantees that any claim not reaching “Triage Claim” within 48 h follows the escalation path, satisfying the SLA.
