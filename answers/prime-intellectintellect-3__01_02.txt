Based on the **Acme Bank Micro-loan Fast-Track process (non-standard variant, May 2025)**, here are the decision points and required documents:

### Decision Points
1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate** (after step 4b):
    *   If the two risk scores (from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B) differ by **≤ 2 points**, continue to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** (step 6).
    *   Else, escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision, then continue to step 6.

2.  **Amount Threshold Decision** (step 7):
    *   If **amount < €15 000**, the system **auto-approves** and proceeds to **Disburse Funds** (step 9).
    *   If **amount ≥ €15 000**, proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** (step 8).

3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval** (step 8):
    *   The board votes *approve* or *reject*.
    *   If approved, proceed to **Disburse Funds** (step 9). If rejected, process ends.
