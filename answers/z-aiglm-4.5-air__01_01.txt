Based solely on the provided Contoso Airlines flight-refund process description and constraints, here are the decision points and required documents:

**Decision Points:**

1.  **Refund Amount Threshold:** The critical decision occurs after the initial validation and pre-approval. The process must determine if the refund amount is **greater than €1,000**.
    *   **If YES (>€1,000):** The case proceeds to the mandatory **Senior_Auditor_Review** activity.
    *   **If NO (≤€1,000):** The process skips Senior_Auditor_Review and moves directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.

**Required Documents:**

*   **Customer_Submit_Claim:**
    *   `RefundRequestForm` (completed by the passenger)
*   **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility:**
    *   `FlightManifest` (used for validation)
    *   `WeatherReport` (used for validation)
*   **Finance_Controller_PreApprove:**
    *   `EligibilityChecklist` (used for signing off)
*   **Senior_Auditor_Review:** (Only required if the refund amount decision point is YES)
    *   `AuditTrail` (must be included)
*   **Process_Refund_Payment:**
    *   `BankTransferAuthorization` (must be present)
*   **Issue_Confirmation_Letter:**
    *   `RefundConfirmationPDF` (generated and emailed by the system)

**Summary Table:**

| Activity                      | Decision Point? | Required Documents                                  |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer_Submit_Claim         | No              | `RefundRequestForm`                                 |
| Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility | No              | `FlightManifest`, `WeatherReport`                   |
| Finance_Controller_PreApprove | No              | `EligibilityChecklist`                              |
| **Senior_Auditor_Review**     | *(Result of)*   | `AuditTrail` *(Only if refund amount > €1,000)*      |
| **Decision:** Amount > €1,000 | **YES**         | (Triggers Senior_Auditor_Review)                    |
| **Decision:** Amount > €1,000 | **NO**          | (Skips Senior_Auditor_Review)                       |
| Process_Refund_Payment        | No              | `BankTransferAuthorization`                         |
| Issue_Confirmation_Letter     | No              | `RefundConfirmationPDF`                             |

**Key Notes:**

*   The only explicit decision point is the **Refund Amount Threshold (>€1,000)**.
*   The constraint "Process_Refund_Payment may begin only after Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded **and**, for high-value claims, **Senior_Auditor_Review** has been completed" reinforces that the decision determines the path taken.
*   No other decision points are defined in the process steps or constraints.
*   The legacy activity "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" does not exist and is not part of this process.
