**Decision Points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**

1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate (Step 5):** A decision to either continue or escalate is made based on whether the two risk scores differ by more than 2 points. If they do, the case is sent to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break.
2.  **Amount Threshold Decision (Step 7):** A decision is made based on the loan amount. Applications for **less than €15,000** are auto-approved. Applications for **€15,000 or more** are routed to the **Micro-loan Board**.
3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) (Step 8):** The board makes the final *approve* or *reject* decision for loans of €15,000 or more.
