**Decision points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track process**

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)**  
   – Confirm ID card and mobile phone are valid; decide whether KYC is satisfied so the case can move forward (all credit history checks are explicitly skipped).

2. **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)**  
   – The Impact Officer reviews the Community Impact Statement (CIS) and decides on the assessed community impact used downstream.

3. **Dual Underwriter Split**  
   - **Senior Underwriter A**  
     – **Senior Underwriter A** assigns an independent risk score from 0–9.  
   - **Shadow Underwriter B**  
     – **Shadow Underwriter B** assigns a separate independent risk score from 0–9.

4. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   – Compare the two risk scores:  
   • If the scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the case continues to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.  
   • If the scores differ by **> 2 points**, escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision, then continue.

5. **Harmonisation Committee** (within the Underwriter Alignment Gate path)  
   – Provides a tie-break decision on the risk outcome when the two underwriter scores are too far apart, then the case proceeds.

6. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**  
   – Collect at least **3 local references** and decide whether the Neighbourhood Feedback requirement is complete so the case can move to the amount-based decision.

7. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   – Decide based on the requested amount:  
   • If **amount < €15 000**, the system **auto-approves**.  
   • If **amount ≥ €15 000**, the case proceeds to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.

8. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**  
   – The Micro-loan Board votes to **approve** or **reject**.  
   – If approved, the process proceeds to **Disburse Funds**.
