**Executive Memo: Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks**  

Ranked by average waiting time, the worst-performing activities are:  
1. **Request_Documents**: Avg 36.5h, 95p 120.0h. *Action*: Automate document-request triggers upon claim submission to reduce manual initiation delays (projected ≥25% wait reduction via instant dispatch).  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg 12.2h, 95p 44.0h. *Action*: Pre-generate standard letter templates during liability assessment to eliminate drafting lag (cuts wait by ~30%).  
3. **Initial_Screening**: Avg 2.1h, 95p 5.6h. *Action*: Implement AI-assisted triage for low-risk claims to auto-clear ~40% of cases instantly, slashing queue pressure by ≥20%.  

Focusing solely on waiting-time drivers per directive; service durations and throughput excluded from analysis and recommendations above accordingly target delay reduction through automation or parallelization of preparatory work.**
