Based on the Acme Bank Micro-loan Fast-Track (May 2025) procedure, here are the decision points and the full list of required documents:

### **Decision Points**
1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate (Step 5):** A comparison between the scores assigned by **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**. 
    *   *Decision:* If the scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues. If the variance is higher, it is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break.
2.  **Amount Threshold Decision (Step 7):** A logic gate based on the requested loan value.
    *   *Decision:* If the **amount < €15 000**, the system triggers an auto-approval. If the **amount ≥ €15 000**, the file is routed for further human review.
3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) (Step 8):** For loans at or above the threshold.
    *   *Decision:* The board performs a final vote to either **approve** or **reject** the application.
