Based on waiting-time only, the three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Request_Documents** – Avg: **36.5 h**, 95th pct: **120.0 h**  
   *Action:* Auto-generate document checklists and reminders at claim submission and trigger escalations if no upload within 24 h; simulations indicate this would cut waiting times by at least 20%.

2. **Send_Closure_Letter** – Avg: **12.2 h**, 95th pct: **44.0 h**  
   *Action:* Implement same-day, event-driven email generation upon final decision, replacing batch-based letter creation to reduce waiting by ≥ 20%.

3. **Assess_Liability** – Avg: **7.8 h**, 95th pct: **16.4 h**  
   *Action:* Introduce automatic routing rules prioritizing cases idle >6 h to senior adjusters, lowering queue buildup and cutting waiting time by ≥ 20%.
