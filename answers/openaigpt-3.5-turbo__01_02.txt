Decision Points:
1. Amount Threshold Decision: If amount < €15 000, auto-approve; if amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to step 8.
2. Underwriter Alignment Gate: If the risk scores assigned by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤ 2 points, continue to step 6; else, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision.
