**Non-compliant**

---

### Justification

1. **Rule 1 (Dual approval before Issue_PO) — ✅ Satisfied.**
The PO amount is €12,300 (> €10,000). `Approve_PO` by *Procurement_Officer* (event 2) is followed by `Approve_PO_CFO` by *CFO* (event 3), and both occur before `Issue_PO` (event 5). Correct order and placement.

2. **Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag consequences) — ❌ VIOLATED.**
`Expedite_Flag` is present (event 4), which makes `Quality_Check` optional (none appears — that is fine). However, the rule **requires** `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. Here, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event 8 while `Risk_Assessment` does not occur until event 9 — **after** `Ship_Goods`. This is a clear violation.

3. **Rule 3 (Three_way_match within 2 activities of Goods_Received) — ❌ VIOLATED.**
`Goods_Received` is event 6. The next two activities are `Move_to_Quality` (event 7, distance 1) and `Ship_Goods` (event 8, distance 2). `Three_way_match` does not appear until event 10, at a distance of **4** from `Goods_Received`, exceeding the permitted distance of 2.

4. **Rule 4 (No Intern directly after CFO) — ✅ Satisfied.**
The only CFO activity is event 3 (`Approve_PO_CFO`). The directly following event 4 (`Expedite_Flag`) is performed by *System*, not an *Intern*. No other Intern→CFO adjacency exists.

5. **Rule 5 (Trace must end with Archive_Record) — ✅ Satisfied.**
The final event (event 11) is `Archive_Record`, with no subsequent activities.

---

**Summary:** Trace 24-EXP violates **Rule 2** (Risk_Assessment occurs after Ship_Goods instead of before) and **Rule 3** (Three_way_match is 4 steps after Goods_Received, exceeding the maximum distance of 2).
