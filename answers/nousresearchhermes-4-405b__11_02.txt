**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance - Critical Under-Performers  

Review of our Q1 claims data reveals three critical bottlenecks:  

1. **Request_Documents** - Severest throughput constraint (190 cases/day vs. 270 downstream), coupled with extreme queueing (150 min avg).  
   - *Action:* Implement parallel outbound document-request workstreams and automated customer reminders to compress cycle time.  

2. **Review_Documents** - Exceptionally high rework rate (5.3%) with large processing variability (9 min stdev) causing the highest SLAs breached (12.4%).  
   - *Action:* Standardize document review criteria via digital checklists/cards to reduce subjectivity and rework loops.  

3. **Initial_Assessment** - High rate of rework (1.8%) and long queueing (18 min) indicate upstream hand-off or skill gaps.  
   - *Action:* Assign dedicatedqueues by claim type and cross-train staff on common error patterns to reduce rework.  

These targeted interventions address the root causes visible in our metrics.
