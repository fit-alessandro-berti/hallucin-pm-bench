Non-compliant
1.  **Rule 2 Violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity #4), which mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at #8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at #9, violating this condition.
2.  **Rule 3 Violation**: `Goods_Received` occurs at #6. Rule 3 states that `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). In this trace, `Three_way_match` (activity #10) occurs at a distance of 4 activities after `Goods_Received` (#7 is distance 1, #8 is distance 2, #9 is distance 3, #10 is distance 4), thus violating the “within the next two activities” requirement.
