4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**
   - **Bias**: The sample may not be representative of the entire population. If the occurrence of manual fraud checks is not evenly distributed across all cases or times, the estimate will be biased.
   - **Small Sample Size**: With only 18 log lines, the sample size is very small. This small sample size can lead to high variance and unreliable estimates of the monthly frequency.
