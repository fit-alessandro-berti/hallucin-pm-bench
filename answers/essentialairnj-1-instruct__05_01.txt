Introduce a 48-hour timer event on the path connecting `Start_Claim` to `Task_Receive`. If the 48 hours elapse without completion of these tasks, manually intervene to auto-escalate the claim. Specifically, add a `bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent` with `bpmn:timerEventDefinition` on sequence flow `f1` leading to `Task_Receive`, setting the `timeDuration` to "PT48H". This timer acts as a safeguard for SLA compliance and should be manually handled if triggered.
