**a) Decision points (gates or conditional branches) in Acme’s process — one sentence each:**

1. **Conditional Branch (Step 4)**: *If* the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome is **Low** or **Medium** *and* the requested loan amount is **≤ €250,000**, then **skip** the Manual-Underwriting-Review step (Step 5); otherwise, proceed to Step 5.  
2. **Gate “TriVote” (Step 6)**: Approval proceeds only if **at least two** of the three required approvers — Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer — vote in favor.

*(Note: Step 4 is a branching condition, not a gate requiring external approvals; Step 6 is a formal gate with a defined voting rule.)*

**b) All documents required anywhere in the process, listed in the order they first appear:**

1. **Form 14B** — received in Step 1  
2. **Scorecard–Cyan**, **Scorecard–Magenta**, **Scorecard–Yellow** — used as *inputs* in Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check); though technically inputs, they are documented artifacts required for the risk assessment  
3. **Deck Memo** — created/used in Step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review), *only if* that step is not skipped  
4. **Offer Sheet 77** — prepared in Step 7  
5. **ID Matrix Declaration** — required alongside the signed Offer Sheet 77 in Step 8  
6. **Loan Dossier 2025** — finalised in Step 9  

✅ **Final ordered list (7 documents)**:  
1. **Form 14B**  
2. **Scorecard–Cyan**  
3. **Scorecard–Magenta**  
4. **Scorecard–Yellow**  
5. **Deck Memo** *(if Step 5 is reached)*  
6. **Offer Sheet 77**  
7. **ID Matrix Declaration**  
8. **Loan Dossier 2025**

> *Clarification*: Since **Deck Memo** is only required when Step 5 occurs (i.e., for high-risk or >€250k loans), it is *conditionally* required. All others (Form 14B, scorecards, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025) are *universally required* across all loan cycles.
