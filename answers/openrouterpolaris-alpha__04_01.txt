Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 violation: Since the trace contains Expedite_Flag (event 4), Risk_Assessment must occur before the first Ship_Goods. In this trace, Ship_Goods (event 8) occurs before Risk_Assessment (event 9), violating Rule 2.
2. All other relevant rules are satisfied:
   2.1. Rule 1: PO_Amount > €10 000; both required approvals (Procurement_Officer at event 2 and CFO at event 3) occur before Issue_PO (event 5).
   2.2. Rule 3: Three_way_match (event 10) occurs within two activities after Goods_Received (event 6); it is the 4th event after, but the rule is about “within the next two activities” after each Goods_Received—here there is only one Goods_Received, and the required control is not met; however, this is overshadowed by the stricter reading: the rule is actually violated because Three_way_match is not within two events (it is 4 steps away: 7, 8, 9, then 10). (Thus, Rule 3 is also violated.)
   2.3. Rule 4: No Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity; CFO is at event 3, followed by System (event 4), so compliant.
   2.4. Rule 5: Archive_Record is the final activity (event 11) with nothing after it, so compliant.
