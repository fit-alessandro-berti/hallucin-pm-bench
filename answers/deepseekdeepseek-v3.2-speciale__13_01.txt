4. Two sampling-related reasons:  
   - The fragment covers only a single day (May 1, 2025), which may not be representative of the entire month due to daily fluctuations, weekly patterns, or seasonal effects.  
   - The sample size is extremely small (only 4 cases and 18 events), leading to high statistical uncertainty and the possibility that the observed frequency (5.56%) is far from the true population proportion.
