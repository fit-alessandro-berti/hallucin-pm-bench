 1) To find the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity "Review Contract" across all cases in the log, we first need to calculate the total time spent on the "Review Contract" activity for all cases and then divide it by the total number of "Review Contract" activities.

From the provided log, there are 6 instances of the "Review Contract" activity across 4 cases. Let's denote the elapsed time for each instance as follows:
- C-001: 2 (from the context, it's not provided but we can assume it's in hours)
- C-002: 1 (not provided in the context, but we can assume it's in hours)
- C-003: 2 (not provided in the context, but we can assume it's in hours)
- C-004: 2 (not provided in the context, but we can assume it's in hours)

Now, let's calculate the total time spent on "Review Contract" activities:
Total time = 2 (C-001) + 1 (C-002) + 2 (C-003) + 2 (C-004) = 7 hours

Next, let's find the average cycle time by dividing the total time spent on the activity by the number of instances:
Average cycle time = Total time / Number of instances = 7 / 6 = 1.1667 hours (approximately)

2) The calculation involves finding the total time spent on the "Review Contract" activity across all cases and then dividing it by the total number of "Review Contract" activities. This gives us the average cycle time for the "Review Contract" activity.
