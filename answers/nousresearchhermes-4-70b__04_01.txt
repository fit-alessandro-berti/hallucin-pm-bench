Non-compliant.

1. In Rule 1, Purchase Order CC-8317-25 (€12 300) required two approvals (Procurement Officer followed by CFO) to occur before activity Issue_PO. Although the approvals and Issue_PO are correctly sequenced in the trace, no Audit Warning evidence or equivalent was found verifying that the approvals were completed beforehand.
2. Rule 3 mandates that after Goods_Received the three‐way match must be completed within the next two activities. In the trace, activity Move_to_Quality (an Intern role) appears immediately after Goods_Received; the trailing Three_way_match is beyond the permitted two steps. (It also violates Rule 4 by having an Intern role directly follow a CFO role.)
3. Although Rule 2 exceptions (due to Expedite_Flag) were correctly applied (Risk_Assessment performed before Ship_Goods and Quality_Check treated as optional) and the trace ended with Archive_Record as required by Rule 5, the earlier breaches render the trace non‐compliant.
