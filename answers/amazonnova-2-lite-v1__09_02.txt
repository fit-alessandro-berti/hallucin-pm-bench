**The average cycle time for the “Dual Authorization” activity cannot be determined from the provided information.**

**Explanation:**  
The frequency table shows how many times each activity started and completed, but it does **not** include any timestamps or duration data. To calculate cycle time (i.e., the time from “start” to “complete” for an activity), you need the actual start and end timestamps for each instance of the activity. Since neither timestamps nor elapsed durations are released, the average cycle time cannot be computed.
