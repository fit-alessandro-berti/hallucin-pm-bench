Add an **interrupting boundary timer event** to **`Task_RequestDocs`** (e.g., `Timer_SLA48h`) with a **timeDate** based on the submission timestamp from **`Start_Claim`** (e.g., “`startTime + PT48H`”). If the claim is still waiting for documents when the timer fires, **interrupt `Task_RequestDocs` and route directly to `Task_Triage`** (reuse `Task_Triage` as the escalation point via a new sequenceFlow to it). This guarantees that “Triage Claim” is reached within 48 hours even when documents are missing, satisfying the SLA without adding tasks/subprocesses.
