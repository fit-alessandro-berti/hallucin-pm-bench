**1.** The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time** (in case C05).  

**2.**  
a) **2.08%** of all events:  
- Total events: 48  
- Manual_Fraud_Check events: 1  
- Calculation: \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 \approx 2.08\% \)  

b) **8.33%** of all unique cases:  
- Total cases: 12  
- Cases with Manual_Fraud_Check: 1 (C05)  
- Calculation: \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 \approx 8.33\% \)  

**3.** A low-support activity like "Manual_Fraud_Check" (1/48 events, 1/12 cases) can skew performance metrics (e.g., average process duration) if generalized, as its impact is statistically insignificant in this sample. Predictive models may overlook it entirely, failing to account for its potential delays or resource demands. Overlooking rare-but-critical paths risks inaccurate process simulations and flawed decision-making.
