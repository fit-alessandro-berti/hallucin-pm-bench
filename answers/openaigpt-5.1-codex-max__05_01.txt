Attach an interrupting boundary timer event to **Task_RequestDocs** (id `Task_RequestDocs`) configured with a timeDate like `submittedAt + PT48H` (or a relative duration from submission), and add a sequence flow from that timer directly to **Triage Claim** (`Task_Triage`). This way, if the missing-documents path hasn’t reached triage within 48 hours of `Start_Claim`, the timer fires, cancels waiting for docs, and auto‑escalates the claim into `Task_Triage`, ensuring compliance with the SLA.
