**1️⃣ Count of “Manual Fraud Check”**  
- The activity **“Manual Fraud Check”** appears **once** in the excerpt (Case 1002 at 2025‑03‑01 09:07:13Z).

**2️⃣ Why the snippet can mislead the analyst (≤ 120 words)**  
The excerpt covers only a few minutes on a single day and includes just three cases. It may not represent the full process variability across the month—e.g., many cases could follow a different path, or the manual fraud check might be triggered only for high‑risk applications that are rare in this slice. Consequently, the observed frequency (1 occurrence) can be either an over‑ or under‑estimate of the true monthly count, leading to inaccurate conclusions about the activity’s overall prevalence.
