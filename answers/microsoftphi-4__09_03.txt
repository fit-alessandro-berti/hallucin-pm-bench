To compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity "Approve Invoice," as well as the standard deviation and a 95% confidence interval, we need specific data from the event log, which has been redacted. Specifically, we need:

1. The start and complete times for each instance of the "Approve Invoice" activity to calculate the duration for each instance.
2. The number of occurrences of the "Approve Invoice" activity to compute averages and perform statistical calculations.

Since every row and timestamp value in the event log has been removed for privacy, we cannot access the required start and complete times for the "Approve Invoice" activity. Without these times, we cannot calculate the individual cycle times, nor can we determine the average, standard deviation, or confidence interval.

Therefore, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity based on the provided information.
