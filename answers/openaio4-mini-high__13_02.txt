1. Manual_Fraud_Check occurs 1 time.  
2. a) 1/48 events = 2.08%  
   b) 1/12 cases = 8.33%  
3. Because it appears only once, any performance metric (e.g. average handling time) tied to that activity is based on a single outlier and lacks statistical support. Predictive models trained on this slice may over-weight or misinterpret the manual check’s influence, leading to biased or unreliable forecasts when applied to new claims. Low‐support activities thus risk skewing analyses if generalised beyond their rare occurrence.
