**No**  
- **Rule 1**: Satisfied (QE occurs before RA, both present).  
- **Rule 2**: Satisfied (VP occurs after QE and RA).  
- **Rule 3**: Violated (NA occurs *before* RA is completed).  
- **Rule 4**: Satisfied (CC occurs after NA and VP).  

The trace fails compliance due to **Rule 3** violation: `Notify_Authorities` must not occur until *both* QE and RA are complete. Here, NA happens after QE but *before* RA.
