# Analysis: Can T5 fire before T3?

I'll analyze whether T5 can fire before T3 in any reachable marking of the given Petri net.

## Key Components to Consider:
- T5 requires a token in p3 and NO token in p4 to fire
- T3 consumes a token from p2 and produces a token in p4

## Firing Sequence Analysis:

Starting from initial marking M₀ = (1,0,0,0,0,0,0) for places p0 through p6:

1. Only T1 is enabled initially
2. After T1 fires: M₁ = (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)
3. From M₁, both T2 and T3 are enabled

If we fire T2 first:
- After T2: M₂ = (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)
- At this point, T5 has a token in p3, but we need to check if p4 is empty
- T3 hasn't fired yet, so p4 remains empty
- Therefore T5 is enabled at M₂

## Concrete Firing Sequence:
T1 → T2 → T5

## Justification:
T5 can indeed fire before T3. After T1 and T2 fire, p3 has a token and p4 is still empty (since T3 hasn't fired yet). This satisfies both conditions for T5 to fire: a token in p3 and the inhibitor arc condition (no token in p4).

The answer is **yes**, T5 can fire before T3.
