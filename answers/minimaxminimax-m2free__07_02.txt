We need to compare the two BPMN XML versions and list the changes in tasks (added, removed) and gateway-type changes (Exclusive -> Inclusive). Note that we need to ignore cosmetic renamings (like task name changes) or reordered XML lines. So we need to identify tasks that were added, tasks that were removed, and the type changes of gateways.

First we should parse the tasks present in each version.

In v1, tasks (elements of type "task"):

- Task_ReviewApplication (name "Review Application")
- Task_ApproveLoan (name "Approve Loan")
- Task_RejectLoan (name "Reject Loan")

Total 3 tasks.

In v2, tasks (type "task"):

- Task_VerifyIdentity (name "Verify Identity")
- Task_ReviewApplication (name "Review Application")
- Task_ApproveLoan (name "Auto-Approve Loan")
- Task_RequestDocs (name "Request Additional Documents")
- Task_FinalReject (name "Final Reject")

Total 5 tasks.

Thus we have:

Added tasks (in v2 relative to v1):
- Task_VerifyIdentity
- Task_RequestDocs
- Task_FinalReject

Removed tasks (in v2 relative to v1):
- Task_RejectLoan

Check if any other tasks changed ID? Task_ApproveLoan stays same ID but changed name. Since name change is cosmetic, we ignore it (i.e., do not treat as removed). So removed tasks only the Reject Loan.

Now for gateway-type changes:

In v1: Exclusive Gateway with id Gateway_Decision (name "Eligible?"). ExclusiveGateway.

In v2: InclusiveGateway with id Gateway_Decision (name "Eligibility Check").

Thus the gateway changed type from exclusive to inclusive. We also note that the gateway name changed but that's cosmetic.

Thus under gateway-type changes, we should note "Gateway_Decision: ExclusiveGateway → InclusiveGateway".

Also check if any other gateway present? Only one.

Thus answer should be under headings:

- Added tasks
- Removed tasks
- Gateway-type changes

We should include the IDs (and optionally names) for clarity but ignore name changes. Use bullet points.

Now we should consider if there are any changes to flow IDs etc. Not required.

Now produce answer.

Edge Cases:

We need to ensure we ignore cosmetic renamings or reordered XML lines. So do not mention that the task name changed for ReviewApplication (still "Review Application" same? In v2 it's still "Review Application", so unchanged. Task_ApproveLoan name changed from "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan", but it's still same ID, so we ignore.

Thus answer:

Added tasks:
- Verify Identity (Task_VerifyIdentity)
- Request Additional Documents (Task_RequestDocs)
- Final Reject (Task_FinalReject)

Removed tasks:
- Reject Loan (Task_RejectLoan)

Gateway-type changes:
- Gateway_Decision: ExclusiveGateway → InclusiveGateway

Make sure to use correct heading formatting: "Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway-type changes".

Probably we should not add extra headings or text.

Now produce answer.

**Added tasks**  
- Verify Identity (id Task_VerifyIdentity)  
- Request Additional Documents (id Task_RequestDocs)  
- Final Reject (id Task_FinalReject)  

**Removed tasks**  
- Reject Loan (id Task_RejectLoan)  

**Gateway‑type changes**  
- Gateway_Decision: ExclusiveGateway → InclusiveGateway
