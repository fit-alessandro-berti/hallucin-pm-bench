No. In the log fragment, case C003 (lines 6 and 7) shows *Validate_Payment* occurring **before** *Receive_Order* (C003,10:43:00 vs. 10:45:00), and case C005 (lines 11 and 12) shows *Validate_Payment* followed by *Cancel_Order* without any *Receive_Order* event. These instances directly contradict the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order*.
