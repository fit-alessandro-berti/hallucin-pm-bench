We need to follow the exact terminology in the process. The user asks: Summarize the decision points in Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track process and list every required document. Use exactly the activity names given; do not introduce standard loan terminology.

Thus we need to provide a list of decision points with the activity names exactly as per the steps. Also, required documents list exactly as given.

We must not include any extra text that modifies terminology. We must not use standard loan terms like "credit check" or "branch manager". Must follow exact names: "Receive Micro-loan Application (RMA)", "Quick KYC Verification (KYC)", "Community Impact Assessment (CIA)", "Dual Underwriter Split", "Senior Underwriter A", "Shadow Underwriter B", "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Harmonisation Committee", "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)", "Amount Threshold Decision", "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)", "Disburse Funds". Also required documents: "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)", "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)", "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)", "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template", "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet", "Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)". Provide them.

But the user specifically asks: Summarise the decision points and list every required document. We need to be careful: The decision points are at steps where a decision is made. Those include: Quick KYC Verification (KYC) - it's a verification; if fails, process stops? Not explicitly in description. But it's a decision point: verifying ID and phone. Then Underwriter Alignment Gate (score difference <=2) and else escalate to Harmonisation Committee. Then Amount Threshold Decision (>=15k triggers board). And Final Micro-loan Board Approval. Possibly also Disburse Funds is not a decision point, just final step. So we should list these decision points with their activity names.

We must avoid adding extra explanation beyond a concise summary. Provide bullet points for decision points, each labelled with exact activity names.

Make sure to not add standard loan terminology. Use only the terms given. Use uppercase terms as they appear? Example: "Dual Underwriter Split" is a step, but not a decision point itself. But the two underwriters assign scores (4a and 4b). That's not a decision point, but the alignment gate is. So summarizing decision points: KYC verification, Underwriter Alignment Gate, Harmonisation Committee (if needed), Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval.

We might include the "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" as a decision point? It says collect at least 3 local references; that is a requirement for proceeding to next step. But it's not a decision point like approval. It's a collection step. So maybe not. But could be considered a gate: if less than 3 references, the process stops? Not specified. So perhaps not needed.

Thus answer: list of decision points with activity names.

We also need to list required documents exactly as given. Provide bullet list.

We should not add any other text, not any extra explanation. However, we can provide a short header like "Decision Points" and "Required Documents". Use exactly the activity names.

Thus final answer.

**Decision points**

- **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – confirm ID card and mobile phone (stop if verification fails).  
- **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – compare Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B scores (continue if difference ≤ 2; otherwise escalate to **Harmonisation Committee**).  
- **Harmonisation Committee** – tie‑break decision when scores differ by > 2 points.  
- **Amount Threshold Decision** – evaluate requested amount: < €15 000 → auto‑approve; ≥ €15 000 → proceed to board.  
- **Final Micro‑loan Board Approval (MBA)** – board votes *approve* or *reject*.

**Required documents**

- Digital Application Form (ML‑APP‑01)  
- Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)  
- Latest Income Statement (single pay‑stub or tax slip)  
- Community Impact Statement (CIS) template  
- Dual Underwriter Score‑Sheet  
- Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)
