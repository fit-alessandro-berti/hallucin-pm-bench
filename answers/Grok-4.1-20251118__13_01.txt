4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.  
- The fragment contains only 4 cases (traces) from a single day (2025-05-01), so the sample size is extremely small and provides almost no statistical reliability for extrapolating to an entire month.  
- There is no information indicating how these 4 cases were selected (e.g., random sample, all cases of the day, high-risk cases only, etc.), so sampling bias cannot be ruled out and representativeness of the broader monthly population is unknown.
