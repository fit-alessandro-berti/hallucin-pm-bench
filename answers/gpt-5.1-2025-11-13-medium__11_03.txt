Subject: Priority bottlenecks in application processing

Analysis of the eight process activities shows three clear bottlenecks when jointly considering SLA breaches and waiting times.

Risk Review averages 600s against a 300s SLA, exceeding its target by 300s, with a very high average waiting time of 480s. Legal Approval also averages 900s against a 600s SLA, likewise breaching by 300s, and has the highest waiting time at 600s. Credit Assessment averages 300s versus a 240s SLA, exceeding its target by 60s, with a waiting time of 200s.

These three activities drive the most significant delays in the end-to-end process and should be prioritized for intervention.

- Risk Review: Reduce the 480s waiting time by increasing review capacity or prioritization relative to other activities that are within SLA.  
- Legal Approval: Reconfigure approval scheduling to cut the 600s waiting time that drives the 300s SLA overrun.  
- Credit Assessment: Streamline hand-offs to lower the 200s waiting time and close the 60s SLA gap.
