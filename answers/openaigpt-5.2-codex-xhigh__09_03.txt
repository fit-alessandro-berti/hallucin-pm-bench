I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95 % confidence interval for “Approve Invoice” because the provided event-log stub contains only column headers and no event records or timestamps. Calculating these metrics requires the actual start_time and complete_time values (and the number of occurrences) for the “Approve Invoice” activity; none of these data are available in the artefacts, and the SLA excerpt does not supply the needed raw measurements.
