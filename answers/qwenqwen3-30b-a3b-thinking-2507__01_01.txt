### Decision Points in Contoso's Refund Process  
*(Based solely on defined activities and constraints)*  

1. **Eligibility Validation Decision**  
   - **Trigger**: After *Customer_Submit_Claim*.  
   - **Decision**: Whether the refund claim meets eligibility criteria.  
   - **Basis**: Verification against *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.  
   - **Outcome**:  
     - *Eligible*: Proceeds to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**.  
     - *Ineligible*: Process halted (no defined path for rejection).  

2. **High-Value Claim Decision**  
   - **Trigger**: After **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** succeeds.  
   - **Decision**: Whether the refund amount exceeds €1,000.  
   - **Basis**: Amount specified in the claim (explicitly defined as "greater than €1 000").  
   - **Outcome**:  
     - *≥ €1,000*: Requires **Senior_Auditor_Review** (with *AuditTrail*).  
     - *< €1,000*: Proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.

### Key Notes  
- **No legacy activities**: "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" is explicitly excluded (per constraints).  
- **Process flow**: **Process_Refund_Payment** *only* starts after *both*:  
  - **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** succeeds **AND**  
  - For high-value claims, **Senior_Auditor_Review** (with *AuditTrail*) is completed.  
- **All artifacts strictly sourced** from the defined process description.  
- *No documents* are listed for steps not explicitly named (e.g., no "rejection letter" or "payment receipt").
