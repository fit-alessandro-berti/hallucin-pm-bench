### Summary of Changes between BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2  

#### Added tasks  
- **Verify Identity** (preceding "Review Application")  
- **Request Additional Documents** (new branch after the gateway)  

#### Removed tasks  
- **Reject Loan** (replaced by **Final Reject**, but considered a cosmetic rename and ignored)  

#### Gateway-type changes  
- **Exclusive Gateway** (v1, named "Eligible?") → **Inclusive Gateway** (v2, named "Eligibility Check")  

### Notes  
- **Ignore cosmetic renamings**:  
  - "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan"  
  - "Reject Loan" → "Final Reject"  
  - Gateway name change ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check")  
- **Ignore reordered XML lines**: SequenceFlow order differences are irrelevant.  
- **Process flow implications**:  
  - The gateway change (Exclusive → Inclusive) allows potential concurrency (e.g., "eligible" + "missing docs" could both execute), though the model still uses mutually exclusive labels.  
  - The new "Request Additional Documents" task adds a third path after the gateway.
