Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 is violated: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (Activity #4), which makes `Quality_Check` optional — but this does not excuse the violation of the condition that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. Here, `Ship_Goods` (Activity #8) occurs at timestamp 2025-05-06 09:40, while `Risk_Assessment` (Activity #9) occurs afterward at 10:31 — violating Rule 2’s strict precedence requirement.

2. Rule 3 is violated: After `Goods_Received` (Activity #6), the next two activities are `Move_to_Quality` (#7) and `Ship_Goods` (#8). `Three_way_match` (#10) is the *third* activity after `Goods_Received`, exceeding the allowed distance of ≤2. The rule demands that `Three_way_match` occur within the next two activities — i.e., by Activity #8 at the latest. It does not.

3. Rule 4 is violated: Activity `Move_to_Quality` (Activity #7) is executed by `Intern`, and it directly follows `Expedite_Flag` (#4) — but that’s not the issue. However, `Approve_PO_CFO` (#3) is executed by `CFO`, and the very next activity involving a human role is `Move_to_Quality` (#7) by `Intern`, but they are separated by `Issue_PO` (#5, System) and `Goods_Received` (#6, Warehouse_Clerk). So no *direct* CFO → Intern sequence. So Rule 4 is **not** violated.

   Correction: Rule 4 is **not** triggered here — because `CFO` (#3) is followed by `Expedite_Flag` (#4, System), then `Issue_PO` (#5, System), then `Goods_Received` (#6, Warehouse_Clerk), then `Move_to_Quality` (#7, Intern). So no direct CFO → Intern transition. Rule 4 compliant.

   BUT — Rule 5 is satisfied: Trace ends with `Archive_Record` (#11) and nothing follows — compliant.

   However, Rules 2 and 3 are both violated.

Final justification: Trace 24-EXP violates **Rule 2** (`Risk_Assessment` after `Ship_Goods`) and **Rule 3** (`Three_way_match` appears too late, beyond 2 activities after `Goods_Received`). Therefore, it is **Non-compliant**.
