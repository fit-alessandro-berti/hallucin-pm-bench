**No**

**Justification:**

*   **Rule 1 is satisfied:** Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occur exactly once, and QE happens before RA. 
*   **Rule 2 is satisfied:** The case has `severity = "High"`, and `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) correctly occurs after both QE and RA are complete.
*   **Rule 3 is violated:** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs *before* `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA). The rule explicitly requires that NA must not happen until *both* QE and RA are complete. 
*   **Rule 4 is satisfied:** `Close_Case` (CC) occurs at the very end of the trace, successfully following both NA and VP (which was required due to the "High" severity). 

Because Rule 3 was violated, the trace is not compliant with ruleset R.
