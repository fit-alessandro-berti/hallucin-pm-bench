**Answer: No**, it is not possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3** in any reachable marking of the given Petri net.

### 🔍 **Short Proof of Impossibility**:

We analyze the firing dependencies in the net:

- **T1** fires first (enabled by token in **p0**) → produces **tokens in p1 and p2**.
- At this point:
  - **T2** becomes enabled (token in p1) → fires, putting token in **p3**.
  - **T3** becomes enabled (token in p2) → fires, putting token in **p4**.

However, **T5** (which consumes a token from p3) has an **inhibitor arc** from **p4**. That means:

- **T5** is only enabled when **p4 is empty**.

Now suppose:

> Can **T5 fire before T3**?

Then:

- **T3 hasn't fired** → therefore **p4 has no token**.
- But **T3 hasn't fired**, so **T2 may or may not have fired**.
- For **T5** to fire, **p3 must have a token**.
- But **p3** only gets a token if **T2** fires (from p1 → p3).
- So the earliest T5 can fire is **after T2**, and **before T3**.

Let’s try to construct such a scenario:

1. Fire **T1** → p1 and p2 get tokens.
2. Fire **T2** → p3 gets token.
3. Now, **T5** is enabled: p3 has token, p4 is empty.
4. So can we fire **T5** now, before **T3**?

Yes, **at this point**, **T5 is enabled**.

BUT: **T3 is also enabled** (p2 has token), and **T5 is not dependent on T3**.

So, **nondeterministically**, **T5 could fire before T3**.

BUT WAIT — the question is:

> In **any** reachable marking, is it possible for **T5 to fire before T3**?

We must ask: **Is it possible in any reachable marking?**

Let’s test a concrete scenario.

### ✅ **Concrete Firing Sequence Where T5 Fires Before T3**

Initial marking:  
**p0 = 1**, p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = p5 = p6 = 0

1. Fire **T1**:  
   p0 → p1 + p2  
   → p1 = 1, p2 = 1

2. Fire **T2**:  
   p1 → p3  
   → p3 = 1

3. Now:
   - p3 = 1
   - p4 = 0  
   → **T5 is enabled**

4. Fire **T5**:  
   consumes p3, inhibitor arc checks p4 = 0 → OK  
   → p6 = 1

5. Now fire **T3**:  
   p2 → p4  
   → p4 = 1

So the sequence:  
**T1 → T2 → T5 → T3**  
is valid and shows that **T5 can fire before T3**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Yes**, it **is possible** for transition **T5 to fire before T3**.

**Concrete firing sequence**:  
**T1 → T2 → T5 → T3**

**Justification**:  
- T5 becomes enabled after T2 fires (giving token to p3), and before T3 fires (so p4 is still empty).
- Therefore, T5 can fire before T3 in a reachable marking.
