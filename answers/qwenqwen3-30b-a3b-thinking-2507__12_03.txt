No  

**Justification**:  
The FACT claims "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order," but this is violated in two cases:  

- **Case C002**:  
  `Receive_Order` (09:30:00) → **`Pack_Items`** (09:50:00) → `Validate_Payment` (10:05:00)  
  → *`Validate_Payment` does **not** immediately follow `Receive_Order`; `Pack_Items` occurs first.*  

- **Case C004**:  
  `Receive_Order` (10:05:00) → **`Check_Fraud`** (10:07:00) → `Validate_Payment` (10:20:00)  
  → *`Validate_Payment` does **not** immediately follow `Receive_Order`; `Check_Fraud` occurs first.*  

While C001 and C003 *do* satisfy the sequence (`Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment`), the word "always" requires the sequence to hold for **every** case. Since C002 and C004 violate the rule, the FACT is **incorrect**.
