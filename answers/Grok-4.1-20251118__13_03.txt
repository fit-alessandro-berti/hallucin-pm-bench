1️⃣ The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs **1 time** in the excerpt.

2️⃣ This snippet contains only 3 cases and shows just one manual fraud check (Case 1002). An analyst seeing only this tiny sample (3 out of potentially thousands of cases for March 2025) might conclude that manual fraud checks are rare (~33%) or even exceptional. In the full log, the actual frequency could be much higher or lower depending on overall volume, fraud patterns, or system changes during the month. With such limited data, any proportion derived from this excerpt is statistically meaningless and likely to mislead. (78 words)
