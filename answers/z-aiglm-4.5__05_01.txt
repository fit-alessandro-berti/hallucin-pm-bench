Add a boundary timer event (ID: e.g., "Timer_48h") to "Task_RequestDocs" with a 48-hour duration. Connect it to "Task_Triage" via a new sequence flow (ID: e.g., "f_timer"). If "Task_RequestDocs" isn't completed within 48 hours, the timer triggers, bypassing the incomplete doc request and forcing the process directly to "Task_Triage". This ensures the SLA is met without adding tasks.
