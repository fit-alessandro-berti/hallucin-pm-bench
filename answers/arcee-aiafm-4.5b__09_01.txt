Based on the provided data and historical benchmarks for "Receive Renewal Request" (0.8 h), "Negotiate Terms" (7.2 h), and "Legal Sign-off" (1.1 h), I can determine the average cycle time for "Review Contract" as follows:

1) **Average Cycle Time for "Review Contract"**:
   - "Review Contract" appears 3 times in the log:
     - C-001: 1 occurrence
     - C-002: 1 occurrence
     - C-003: 1 occurrence
   - Total "Review Contract" occurrences = 3
   - Using historical benchmarks:
     - "Receive Renewal Request" = 0.8 h
     - "Negotiate Terms" = 7.2 h
     - "Legal Sign-off" = 1.1 h
   - Calculating weighted average:
     - W1 = 0.8 h × 1 = 0.8 h
     - W2 = 7.2 h × 1 = 7.2 h
     - W3 = 1.1 h × 1 = 1.1 h
     - Total = 0.8 + 7.2 + 1.1 = 9.1 h
     - Average = 9.1 / 3 ≈ 3.0333 h ≈ 3.03 h

2) **Explanation of the Calculation**:
   - I used the known durations from the historical benchmark for each stage.
   - Since "Review Contract" appears three times, I applied the weighted average of the historical metrics to estimate its average duration.
   - The "receive" stage (0.8 h) had the highest weight (one occurrence), the "negotiate" stage (7.2 h) next (one occurrence), and the "legal sign-off" stage (1.1 h) least (one occurrence).
   - This method assumes uniform distribution of "Review Contract" throughout the overall process duration for each case.

Therefore, the average cycle time for "Review Contract" is **3.03 hours**.

Answer:
1) The average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract" across all cases in the log is approximately **3.03 hours**.

2) I calculated this by using the historical benchmark durations for "Receive Renewal Request" (0.8 h), "Negotiate Terms" (7.2 h), and "Legal Sign-off" (1.1 h) and applying weighted averages based on how many times "Review Contract" appeared in the log (three times).
