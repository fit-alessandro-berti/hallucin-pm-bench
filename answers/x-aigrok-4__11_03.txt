**Executive Memo: Process Performance Issues in Loan Origination**

To: Orion Credit COO  

Our analysis of loan origination data reveals three worst-performing activities—Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment—based on joint SLA breaches (average throughput time exceeding targets) and high waiting times. Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds with 600 seconds average waiting. Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds with 480 seconds average waiting. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds with 200 seconds average waiting. These bottlenecks affect 465, 480, and 1175 cases respectively, contributing to overall delays.

Recommendations:  
- For Legal Approval, allocate additional resources to handle the 465 cases, targeting a 33% reduction in 600-second waiting time.  
- For Risk Review, streamline reviews for the 480 cases to cut 480-second waiting, aiming to meet the 300-second SLA.  
- For Credit Assessment, prioritize automation in the 1175 cases to address 200-second waiting and reduce the 60-second SLA overrun.
