To determine if transition T5 can fire before transition T3, we need to analyze the firing sequences and the conditions required for each transition to fire.

### Net Analysis:

1. **Initial Marking**: 
   - \( p0 = 1 \)
   - \( pa = pb = pc = pd = pe = pf = 0 \)

2. **Transition T1**:
   - Input: \( p0 \)
   - Output: \( pa + pb \)
   - New marking: \( pa = 1, pb = 1, p0 = 0 \)

3. **Transition T2** (Normal Path):
   - Input: \( pa \)
   - Output: \( pc \)
   - New marking: \( pc = 1, pa = 0 \)

4. **Transition T2b** (Shortcut):
   - Input: \( pa \)
   - Output: \( pd \)
   - New marking: \( pd = 1, pa = 0 \)

5. **Transition T3**:
   - Input: \( pc \)
   - Output: \( pd \)
   - New marking: \( pd = 1, pc = 0 \)

6. **Transition T4**:
   - Input: \( pb \)
   - Output: \( pe \)
   - New marking: \( pe = 1, pb = 0 \)

7. **Transition T5**:
   - Input: \( pd \) and \( pe \)
   - Output: \( pf \)
   - New marking: \( pf = 1, pd = 0, pe = 0 \)

8. **Transition T6**:
   - Input: \( pf \)
   - Output: \( pc \)
   - New marking: \( pc = 1, pf = 0 \)

### Conditions for T5 to Fire Before T3:

- **T5** requires both \( pd \) and \( pe \) to be marked.
- **T3** requires \( pc \) to be marked.

### Possible Firing Sequence:

1. **T1** fires: \( pa = 1, pb = 1, p0 = 0 \)
2. **T2b** fires: \( pd = 1, pa = 0 \)
3. **T4** fires: \( pe = 1, pb = 0 \)
4. **T5** fires: \( pf = 1, pd = 0, pe = 0 \)

At this point, T5 has fired, and T3 has not yet fired because \( pc \) was never marked.

### Conclusion:

Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. The shortest firing sequence that achieves this is:

\[ \text{T1}, \text{T2b}, \text{T4}, \text{T5} \]
