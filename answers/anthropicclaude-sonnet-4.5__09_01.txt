# Answer

**The requested value cannot be derived from the data provided.**

## Explanation

To calculate the average cycle time (duration) of the activity "Review Contract," I would need **timestamp data** showing when each "Review Contract" activity started and when it completed.

However, the event log header explicitly states:

> "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted"

### What the data *does* show:
- "Review Contract" occurs in cases C-001, C-002, C-003, and C-004
- The resources performing this activity (drafter_3, drafter_1, drafter_4, drafter_3)
- The sequential position of activities within each case

### What is missing:
- Start/end timestamps for any activity
- Duration or elapsed-time measurements
- Any temporal data that would allow cycle-time calculation

### Note on the benchmark data:
The historical benchmark provided contains average durations for three activities ("Receive Renewal Request," "Negotiate Terms," and "Legal Sign-off"), but it:
1. Does **not** include "Review Contract"
2. Comes from a different customer segment (FY-2023)
3. Is explicitly marked as "**not** drawn from this log"

Therefore, it cannot be used as a substitute for calculating the actual cycle time of "Review Contract" in the current event log.
