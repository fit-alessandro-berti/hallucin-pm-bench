Here is the RACI matrix for FinCo’s order-to-cash workflow, adhering to the strict terminology policy:

| **Activity**          | **Account Manager (AM)** | **Compliance Officer (CO)** | **Finance Clerk (FC)** | **IT Support (IT)** |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Receive Application** | **R** (Responsible)     |                            |                        |                     |
| **KYC Review**         |                          | **R** (Responsible)       |                        |                     |
| **Order Vetting**      | **R** (Responsible)     |                            |                        |                     |
| **Payment Clearance**  |                          |                            | **R** (Responsible)   |                     |
| **Record Update**      |                          |                            |                        | **R** (Responsible) |
| **Notify Customer**    | **R** (Responsible)     |                            |                        |                     |

### Notes:
- **Accountable (A)** roles are implicit for each activity’s primary role (e.g., AM is accountable for *Receive Application* and *Order Vetting*).
- **Consulted (C)** and **Informed (I)** roles are omitted for brevity, as the process assumes minimal cross-role dependencies.
