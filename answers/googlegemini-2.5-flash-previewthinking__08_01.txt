Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire *before* transition T3.

Here is one concrete firing sequence from the initial marking where T5 fires before T3:

Sequence: **T1, T2, T5**

**Justification:**

1.  Starting from the initial marking M0 = {p0: 1}, only T1 is enabled. Firing T1 consumes the token in p0 and produces tokens in p1 and p2.
    M0 --[T1]--> M1 = {p1: 1, p2: 1}.
2.  In M1, both T2 (requires p1) and T3 (requires p2) are enabled. T5 is not enabled at this point because it requires a token in p3, which is currently empty.
3.  To enable T5, place p3 must receive a token. This can only happen by firing T2 (p1 -> p3). Let's fire T2.
    M1 --[T2]--> M2 = {p2: 1, p3: 1}. (T2 consumed p1, produced p3; the token in p2 remains as T3 hasn't fired).
4.  In M2, T3 is enabled (requires p2 >= 1) and T5 is also enabled (requires p3 >= 1 AND p4 == 0). At this point, p3 has a token, and p4 is still empty because T3 hasn't fired yet.
5.  Since both T3 and T5 are enabled in M2, we have the choice to fire either. If we choose to fire T5 next:
    M2 --[T5]--> M3 = {p2: 1, p6: 1}.
6.  In this sequence (T1, T2, T5), transition T5 fired, and transition T3 had not fired yet. Therefore, T5 fired before T3 in this reachable state.
