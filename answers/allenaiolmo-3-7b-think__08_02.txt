**Question 1 Answer:** Yes.  
**Explanation:** To fire T5, both P2 and P5 must be present. After T1 (producing P1 and P2), T2 can fire to create P3, then T7 fires to produce P4. T4 then fires on P4 to generate P5. At this point, P2 remains (since T3 hasn’t fired yet), allowing T5 to fire before T3.  

**Minimal Sequence:** T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5.
