The **average cycle time of “Review Contract”** **cannot be derived** from the provided data.

**Explanation:**  
The log header only includes `case_id`, `activity`, and `resource` columns. It does **not** include timestamps (e.g., start or end times) or elapsed durations for individual activities. Since cycle time is defined as the time elapsed *for a specific activity* (i.e., end timestamp − start timestamp), and no timing information is present in the data, the average duration (in hours) for “Review Contract” cannot be calculated.

> Note: The historical benchmark values (e.g., 0.8 h for “Receive Renewal Request”) refer to a different customer segment and year and **cannot** be used to infer activity durations for “Review Contract” in this dataset.
