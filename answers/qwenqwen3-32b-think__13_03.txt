1️⃣ The exact activity **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in the excerpt (CaseID 1002).  

2️⃣ An analyst with only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks due to **small sample size** and **case-specific patterns**. The excerpt includes only three cases (1001, 1002, 1003) and a narrow timeframe (March 1). Case 1002 undergoes a manual fraud check, while others bypass it (e.g., 1001 uses automatic checks, 1003 labels its check as “Fraud Check (Automatic)” vs. “Automatic Fraud Check”). This variability in naming and workflow paths may not reflect broader trends. Additionally, the sample omits cases that might typically include manual checks, leading to skewed conclusions about their prevalence in the full month-long log.
