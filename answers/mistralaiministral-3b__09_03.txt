To compute the average cycle time of activity "Approve Invoice" in the supplied log, we would need to know the start and complete times of each "Approve Invoice" event. Since the log provided only has the header and the first five lines, we cannot compute the required metrics without the actual data.

The standard deviation and 95% confidence interval for the cycle time cannot be computed either without the complete dataset. The standard deviation and confidence interval require the actual times for each "Approve Invoice" event and the number of events to calculate the mean and variance.

Therefore, with the information given, it is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice".
