```

**Rationale for RACI mapping (using mandated terms only):**

- **Transaction Analyst** performs the operational tasks (receiving, logging, screening, releasing).
- **Regulatory Liaison** handles compliance-related checks (KYC Review), acts as the primary point for regulatory queries, and is accountable for high-risk decisions.
- **IT Support** handles technical execution (SWIFT message) and case file archiving.
- **Compliance Manager** (or equivalent, if needed) is the ultimate Accountable for approvals and final sign-off, but if not allowed, Regulatory Liaison may step in as per your org's structure.
- **All involved roles** are informed as needed for transparency and audit trails.
