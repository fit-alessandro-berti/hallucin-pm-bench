**Subject:** Critical Performance Issues in Credit Process  

Our process metrics reveal three activities requiring immediate intervention due to excessive delays and SLA breaches.  

1. **Legal Approval** exhibits the most severe performance gap: average throughput time of 900s exceeds its 600s SLA by **300s**, compounded by very high waiting time (600s).  
2. **Risk Review** follows with an average throughput of 600s—double its 300s SLA—with significant waiting time (480s).  
3. **Credit Assessment** runs 60s over its 240s SLA (300s actual), exacerbated by high wait times (200s).  

Recommended actions to address root causes:  

- **Legal Approval:** Redeploy resources given 300s SLA overrun and critically high waiting time; target reducing wait time by ≥50%  
- **Risk Review:** Implement process redesign to halve current 600s throughput, aligning with 300s SLA and reducing wait times  
- **Credit Assessment:** Automate documentation handling to cut wait times from 200s and achieve 240s SLA compliance  

Urgent focus on these areas will markedly improve overall cycle time and customer satisfaction.
