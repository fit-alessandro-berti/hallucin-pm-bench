To meet the 48-hour SLA, the process must handle delays in the document collection step.

The best improvement is to attach an **interrupting timer boundary event** to `Task_RequestDocs`. Set this timer's duration to 48 hours. Create a new sequence flow from this timer event that directly targets `Task_Triage`.

If the 48-hour period from claim submission is about to expire while the process is in the `Task_RequestDocs` step, the timer will fire. This will interrupt the task and immediately route the claim to `Task_Triage` for auto-escalation. This ensures every claim reaches triage within the specified timeframe, satisfying the SLA without adding any new tasks.
