Based on the Contoso Airlines flight-refund process definition, here are the decision points and the required documentation:

### **Decision Points**

1.  **Eligibility Validation (Triage):** The Triage Agent evaluates the claim against external data to decide if the refund request meets basic criteria.
2.  **Refund Value Threshold (High-Value Branch):** A logical gateway occurs after the Finance Controller’s pre-approval. The process branches based on the refund amount:
    *   **Value ≤ €1,000:** The case proceeds directly to payment.
    *   **Value > €1,000:** The case is routed for a mandatory Senior Auditor Review.
3.  **Payment Authorization:** A final verification occurs within the finance team to ensure that the **BankTransferAuthorization** is signed and that all necessary preceding steps (Pre-approval and, if applicable, the Auditor Review) are complete before executing the transaction.

### **Required Documents**

The process requires the following seven (7) specific artifacts:

*   **RefundRequestForm:** Completed by the passenger during submission.
*   **FlightManifest:** Used by the triage agent to validate the passenger's presence/booking.
*   **WeatherReport:** Used by the triage agent to verify flight conditions.
*   **EligibilityChecklist:** Utilized by the Finance Controller for sign-off.
*   **AuditTrail:** Mandatory for all high-value claims (> €1,000) during the Senior Auditor Review.
*   **BankTransferAuthorization:** Required for the finance team to execute the payment.
*   **RefundConfirmationPDF:** Generated and emailed to the passenger as the final step.
