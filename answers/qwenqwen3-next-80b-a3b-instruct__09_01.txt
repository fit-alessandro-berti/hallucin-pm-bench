1) The average cycle time of the activity “Review Contract” cannot be derived.

2) The event log provides the sequence of activities and resources involved in each case, but it does not include any timestamps or duration values for individual activities. Without elapsed time data for “Review Contract” (or any activity), it is impossible to calculate its average cycle time, even though historical benchmarks are provided for other activities. The system requires raw duration data to compute averages — which is not present.
