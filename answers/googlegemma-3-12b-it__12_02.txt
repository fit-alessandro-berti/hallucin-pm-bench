No.

The statement is inaccurate. While *Validate_Payment* often follows *Receive_Order*, it does not *always* do so. For instance, case C003 begins with *Validate_Payment* (line 6) before the *Receive_Order* activity (line 7). Similarly, case C005 starts with *Validate_Payment* (line 11) and ends with *Cancel_Order* (line 12), lacking a preceding *Receive_Order*. Therefore, *Validate_Payment* does not consistently follow *Receive_Order* within this log fragment.
