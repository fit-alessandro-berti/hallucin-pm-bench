1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs once in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst, based on this snippet alone, could misestimate the prevalence of manual fraud checks due to the limited data set. This excerpt reflects only three cases, presenting a potentially unrepresentative sample of the entire month's process flow. If, in the remainder of the log, there are significantly more or fewer instances of cases requiring a manual fraud check—or variations in process routes depending on case characteristics—the analyst's perspective could be skewed. Without visibility of the full event log, it's challenging to accurately assess the frequency or trigger conditions for manual checks.
