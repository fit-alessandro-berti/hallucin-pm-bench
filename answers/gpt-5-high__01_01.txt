Decision points
- Eligibility validation (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility): Is the claim eligible based on the FlightManifest and WeatherReport? 
  - If eligible, proceed to Finance_Controller_PreApprove; if not, the process cannot move forward.
- Finance pre-approval (Finance_Controller_PreApprove): Does the controller sign off using the EligibilityChecklist?
  - Must succeed to proceed; if not, the process cannot move to payment.
- High-value routing: Is the refund amount greater than €1 000?
  - If yes, route to Senior_Auditor_Review and include the AuditTrail; if no, skip this review.
- Payment start gate (Process_Refund_Payment): Are all prerequisites met?
  - Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded; and for high-value claims, Senior_Auditor_Review is completed; and a signed BankTransferAuthorization is present. Only then may payment be executed.
