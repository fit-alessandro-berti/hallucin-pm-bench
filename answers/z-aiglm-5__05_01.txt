To enforce the SLA, attach an **Interrupting Timer Boundary Event** to **`Task_RequestDocs`**. Set the timer duration to 48 hours. When triggered, this event should cancel the active task and flow directly to **`Task_Triage`**. This modification ensures that even if documents are missing, the claim advances to the triage stage within the required time limit, preventing the process from stalling and meeting the "auto-escalation" requirement without adding new tasks.
