**Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Brief**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** [Current]  
**Subject:** Top Underperforming Activities & Actions  

The three worst-performing activities, based on highest combined wait times, rework rates, processing times, variability, and SLA breaches, are:  

1. **Request_Documents** (throughput 190; avg_wait_time_min 150—highest; rework_rate_pct 22.0%—highest; sla_breach_pct 5.5%). *Excessive queueing and rework bottleneck throughput.* **Action:** Deploy 2-3 additional staff to cut wait time to <30 min, matching Review_Documents.  

2. **Review_Documents** (throughput 185; avg_processing_time_min 25—highest; stdev_processing_time_min 9—highest; rework_rate_pct 5.3%; sla_breach_pct 12.4%—highest). *High variability and duration drive breaches.* **Action:** Standardize process to cap stdev at 2 min, aligning with Approve_Claim.  

3. **Initial_Assessment** (avg_wait_time_min 18—highest early-stage; sla_breach_pct 3.2%—second-highest). *Queueing elevates early breaches.* **Action:** Automate triage to reduce wait to <10 min, per Check_Coverage benchmark.  

These fixes target 20%+ throughput gains.
