**Memo**

To: COO, Orion Insurance  
From: Senior Process-Mining Analyst  
Date: April 12, 2025  
Subject: Top 3 Bottleneck Activities by Waiting Time  

Based on the last 12 months’ data, the three worst‑performing activities by waiting time are:  

1. **Request_Documents** – Avg wait: 36.5 h, 95th %: 120.0 h  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter** – Avg wait: 12.2 h, 95th %: 44.0 h  
3. **Assess_Liability** – Avg wait: 7.8 h, 95th %: 16.4 h  

To reduce waiting times by at least 20%:  

- **Request_Documents**: Implement an automated document‑request system with proactive reminders and a claimant portal to expedite submissions.  
- **Send_Closure_Letter**: Automate generation and dispatch using digital channels immediately upon claim closure.  
- **Assess_Liability**: Introduce a predictive triage model and dynamic workload allocation to cut queue times.  

We will track the impact through updated performance metrics.
