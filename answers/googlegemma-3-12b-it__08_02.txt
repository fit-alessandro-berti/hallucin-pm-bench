Okay, let's analyze this Petri net.

**Question 1:** No, it is *not* possible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

**Question 2:** T5 requires both P2 and P5 to have tokens. T3 consumes P2.  The only path to P5 is through T4, which *requires* P4. P4 is produced by either T2 (via T7) or T3. Therefore, T3 *must* fire before T4, leading to P5, and subsequently, before T5 can fire. No firing sequence can circumvent this dependency. This dependency is structural within the net itself.
