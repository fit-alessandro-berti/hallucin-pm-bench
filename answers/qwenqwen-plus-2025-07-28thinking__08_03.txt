**Answer:**  
Yes, it is possible for **T5** to fire before **T3**.  

**Shortest firing sequence:**  
`T1, T2b, T4, T5`  

**Verification step-by-step:**  
1. **Initial marking**: `p0=1`, all others = 0.  
2. **T1 fires** (enabled by `p0=1`):  
   - Consumes `p0`, produces `pa=1`, `pb=1`.  
   - Marking: `pa=1`, `pb=1` (others 0).  
3. **T2b fires** (enabled by `pa=1`):  
   - Consumes `pa`, produces `pd=1`.  
   - Marking: `pb=1`, `pd=1` (others 0).  
4. **T4 fires** (enabled by `pb=1`):  
   - Consumes `pb`, produces `pe=1`.  
   - Marking: `pd=1`, `pe=1` (others 0).  
5. **T5 fires** (enabled by `pd=1` and `pe=1`):  
   - Consumes `pd` and `pe`, produces `pf=1`.  
   - **T3 has not fired** in this sequence.  

**Explanation**:  
The shortcut transition **T2b** directly routes a token from `pa` to `pd` without requiring **T3** (which depends on `pc`). Thus, **T5** can fire via `pd` (from **T2b**) and `pe` (from **T4**), bypassing **T3** entirely. The sequence `T1 → T2b → T4 → T5` is minimal (length 4) and achieves this.  

**Why this ordering is possible**:  
- **T2b** and **T4** are concurrent after **T1**, allowing `pd` and `pe` tokens to accumulate independently of `pc`.  
- **T3** is never required to fire before **T5** in this path, as `pd` is populated via **T2b**, not **T3**.  

No shorter sequence exists (all require **T1** first, followed by at least 3 transitions to enable **T5**).
