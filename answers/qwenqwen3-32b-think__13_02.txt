3. Low-support activities like **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** (which occurs in 1 case here) can mislead analytics because they are underrepresented in training data for predictive models (e.g., predicting fraud likelihood or case duration). Performance metrics (e.g., average processing time) may exclude manual checks, creating an overly optimistic view of efficiency. Similarly, rare paths like manual fraud checks might lack process rules in automation systems, leading to errors when such cases arise. Small samples hinder accurate generalization.
