Let’s analyze whether **T5** can fire *before* **T3** in any reachable marking.

---

## **Restating the Question:**
"Is it possible, in any sequence starting from the initial marking, for T5 to fire before T3?"

---

## **Step 1: Key properties to note**
- **T5** needs: one token each in **pd** and **pe**
- **T3** needs: one token in **pc**

### **Transitions producing the inputs to T5:**
- **pd** can be reached by **T2b** (from pa) or **T3** (from pc)
- **pe** is reached only by **T4** (from pb)

### **Critical observation:**  
- **T3** produces **pd** from **pc**.
- But **T2b** can also produce **pd** from **pa**, skipping **pc** and thus **T3**.

---

## **Step 2: Would it be possible to get tokens in both pd and pe without firing T3?**

Let’s try to construct such a marking.

### **Initial marking:**  
- p0: 1  (all others 0)

### **T1 fires**  
- p0 → pa, pb  
New marking: pa:1, pb:1

### **Split into two parallel branches:**  
- Option 1: **T2b** fires (pa → pd):  
    - pa:1 → pd:1  
    - pb:1 remains

- Option 2: **T2** fires (pa → pc), but this is the "normal" path; we are specifically trying *not* to fire T3 yet.

Let’s use option 1 (fire **T2b**):

**Marking**: pd:1, pb:1

### **T4 fires (pb → pe):**  
- pd:1, pe:1

Now, marking:  
- pd:1, pe:1

#### At this point:
- **T5** is enabled (**pd** and **pe**), and **T3** has *not* fired yet.

→ **Therefore:** **YES, T5 can fire before T3.**

---

## **Step 3: Give one shortest firing sequence**

Here is one, from the initial marking:

1. **T1**  – (p0 → pa, pb)
2. **T2b** – (pa → pd)
3. **T4**  – (pb → pe)
4. **T5**  – (pd + pe → pf)

In this sequence, **T3** has never fired before **T5**.

---

## **Final answer**

---

### **YES, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.**

**Shortest firing sequence:**
```
T1, T2b, T4, T5
```
In this sequence, T5 fires before any firing of T3.
