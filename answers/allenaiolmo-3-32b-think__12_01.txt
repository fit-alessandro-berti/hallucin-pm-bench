No, the fact is **not accurate**.  

**Justification**:  
- In **Case 1001**, `Update_Inventory` occurs at 2025-03-01 08:25:55, followed by `Authorize_Refund` at 2025-03-01 08:30:02. Here, `Update_Inventory` precedes `Authorize_Refund`.  
- In **Case 1003**, `Update_Inventory` occurs at 2025-03-03 10:08:07, followed by `Authorize_Refund` at 2025-03-03 10:22:18. Again, `Update_Inventory` precedes `Authorize_Refund`.  

The claim requires `Authorize_Refund` to occur **immediately before** `Update_Inventory`, but in both cases where both activities exist, the reverse is true. Case 1002 lacks `Update_Inventory` entirely, so it does not contradict the claim but does not support it either.
