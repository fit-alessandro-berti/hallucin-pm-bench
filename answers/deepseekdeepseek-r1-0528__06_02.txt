Here are the concurrent task sets for **Process B â€” Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing**, based on the defined parallel blocks:

1. **Generate_CAD_Drawing**, **Confirm_Materials_Availability**  
   *(Parallel Block P1: These tasks execute concurrently after Accept_Custom_Order and before P2)*  

2. **Milling_Panels**, **Turning_Legs**, **CNC_Detailing**  
   *(Parallel Block P2: These tasks execute concurrently after P1 completes and before Dry_Fit_Assembly)*  

3. **Sand_Surfaces**, **Apply_Stain**, **Install_Hardware**  
   *(Parallel Block P3: These tasks execute concurrently after Glue_And_Clamp and before Final_Inspection)*  

**Key notes**:  
- Sequential tasks (e.g., `Accept_Custom_Order`, `Dry_Fit_Assembly`, `Glue_And_Clamp`, `Final_Inspection`) are excluded as they cannot run in parallel with other steps.  
- Only the explicit parallel blocks (P1, P2, P3) from Process B are included.  
- No tasks from Processes A or C are referenced.
