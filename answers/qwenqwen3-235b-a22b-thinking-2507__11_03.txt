Subject: Urgent Process Bottlenecks Requiring Intervention  

Three activities jointly breach SLA targets and exhibit high waiting times: Legal Approval (900s throughput vs. 600s SLA, exceeding by 300s with 600s waiting time), Risk Review (600s throughput vs. 300s SLA, exceeding by 300s with 480s waiting time), and Credit Assessment (300s throughput vs. 240s SLA, exceeding by 60s with 200s waiting time). Legal Approval’s waiting time constitutes 67% of its throughput, Risk Review’s 80%, and Credit Assessment’s 67%, indicating severe queue delays.  

• Reallocate staff from Draft Offer (240s throughput, 30s waiting time, 300s SLA slack) to Legal Approval to clear backlog.  
• Cross-train 2 personnel from Verify Identity (120s throughput, 80s waiting time) to augment Risk Review capacity.  
• Automate data validation in Credit Assessment to reduce its 200s waiting time, leveraging its high case volume (1,175).
