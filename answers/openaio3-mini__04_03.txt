Answer: No

Justification:
• Rule 1 is partially met since QE (event 3) and RA (event 5) each occur once and QE comes before RA.
• Rule 2 is satisfied because VP_Safety_Approval (event 6) occurs after both QE and RA.
• Rule 3 is violated because Notify_Authorities (event 4) occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review (event 5).
• Rule 4 is adhered to since Close_Case (event 7) occurs after NA.
Thus, the trace is non-compliant due to the violation of Rule 3.
