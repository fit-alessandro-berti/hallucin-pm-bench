**Q1.** No.

**Q2.**  
After T1 fires, tokens are in P1 and P2.  
- T5 needs tokens in **both P2 and P5**.  
- P5 can only be marked by firing T4.  
- T4 requires a token in **P4**.  
- P4 can be reached either via T3 (from P2) or T7 after T2 (from P1→P3→P4).  

To have P5 marked while still having a token in P2 (needed for T5), the only path is via P1: T1, T2, T7, T4.  
This uses no token from P2, so P2 remains marked.  
Therefore T3 is not needed at all, and **cannot be required to precede T5**.  

Thus T5 can never be forced to occur before T3.
