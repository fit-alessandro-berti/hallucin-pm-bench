Okay, here’s a RACI matrix for FinCo’s Order-to-Cash workflow, strictly adhering to the prescribed terminology and capitalization:

**RACI Matrix – FinCo Order-to-Cash**

| Activity                 | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application       | R                     |                       |                    |                 |
| KYC Review                |                       | R                       |                    |                 |
| Order Vetting             | R                     |                       |                    |                 |
| Payment Clearance         |                       |                       | R                  |                 |
| Record Update             |                       |                       |                    | R               |
| Notify Customer           | R                     |                       |                    |                 |

**Key:**

*   **R** – Responsible (The person who *does* the work)
*   **A** – Accountable (The person who is ultimately answerable for the correct completion of the task)
*   **C** – Consulted (The person whose opinion is sought)
*   **I** – Informed (The person who needs to be kept up-to-date)

**Notes:**

*   The Account Manager is primarily responsible for the initial contact, data completeness checks, and customer notifications.
*   The Compliance Officer is responsible for the KYC Review.
*   The Finance Clerk initiates the Payment Clearance.
*   IT Support is responsible for the Record Update.
