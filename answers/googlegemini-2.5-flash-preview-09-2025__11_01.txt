**SUBJECT: Action Plan for Top 3 Waiting Time Bottlenecks**

The three most severe waiting time bottlenecks require immediate attention:

| Rank | Activity | Avg Wait (h) | 95p Wait (h) | Recommended Action |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **#1** | **Request_Documents** | 36.5 | 120.0 | Automate document request/chaser emails (target: 20% reduction via immediate issuance). |
| **#2** | **Send_Closure_Letter** | 12.2 | 44.0 | Implement system trigger for immediate letter generation post-decision (target: 25% reduction). |
| **#3** | **Assess_Liability** | 7.8 | 16.4 | Dedicate specialized staff to clear the longest-waiting cases daily (target: 20% reduction by addressing 95p delay). |

Addressing these three areas will significantly improve cycle time and customer satisfaction.
