Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2 Violation:** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (Event 4), which triggers the requirement that `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` (Event 8) occurs before `Risk_Assessment` (Event 9).
2. **Rule 3 Violation:** Following `Goods_Received` (Event 6), `Three_way_match` (Event 10) does not occur within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The actual distance is 4 (Events 7, 8, and 9 intervene).
