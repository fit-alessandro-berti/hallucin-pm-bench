**To:** Orion Credit COO
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Subject:** Critical SLA Breaches and Waiting-Time Bottlenecks

Three activities exhibit severe underperformance based on **SLA breaches** and **excessive waiting times**, directly impacting throughput and customer experience:

1. **Legal Approval**
   - **Throughput time (900s)** exceeds the **600s SLA by 300s (50% breach)**.
   - **Waiting time (600s)** accounts for **67% of total time**, indicating idle delays.
2. **Risk Review**
   - **Throughput time (600s)** surpasses the **300s SLA by 300s (100% breach)**.
   - **Waiting time (480s)** constitutes **80% of total time**, signaling process stagnation.
3. **Credit Assessment**
   - **Throughput time (300s)** breaches the **240s SLA by 60s (25% breach)**.
   - **Waiting time (200s)** represents **67% of total time**, highlighting inefficiency.

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Legal Approval:** Implement **parallel processing** for low-risk cases (e.g., pre-approved templates) to reduce waiting time by **≥40%** (target: ≤360s).
- **Risk Review:** Introduce **automated tiered escalation**—route standard cases to junior analysts, reserving senior review for exceptions, cutting waiting time by **≥60%** (target: ≤192s).
- **Credit Assessment:** Integrate **real-time data validation APIs** to eliminate manual checks, reducing waiting time by **≥50%** (target: ≤100s).
