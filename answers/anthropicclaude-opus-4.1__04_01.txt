Let me analyze Trace 24-EXP against each rule in P2P-2025.R1:

**Rule 1**: PO_Amount = €12,300 (exceeds €10,000)
- Activity #2: `Approve_PO` by Procurement_Officer ✓
- Activity #3: `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO ✓
- Activity #5: `Issue_PO` occurs after both approvals ✓
- **COMPLIANT**

**Rule 2**: Trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (Activity #4)
- `Quality_Check` becomes optional (not present in trace - acceptable)
- `Risk_Assessment` must occur before first `Ship_Goods`
- First `Ship_Goods`: Activity #8
- `Risk_Assessment`: Activity #9 (occurs AFTER `Ship_Goods`)
- **NON-COMPLIANT**

**Rule 3**: After `Goods_Received` (Activity #6), `Three_way_match` must occur within next 2 activities
- Activities after `Goods_Received`: #7 `Move_to_Quality`, #8 `Ship_Goods`, #9 `Risk_Assessment`, #10 `Three_way_match`
- Distance from #6 to #10 = 4 activities (exceeds limit of 2)
- **NON-COMPLIANT**

**Rule 4**: No Intern activity may directly follow CFO activity
- CFO activity: #3 `Approve_PO_CFO`
- Next activity: #4 `Expedite_Flag` by System (not Intern)
- Intern activity: #7 `Move_to_Quality` follows #6 by Warehouse_Clerk
- **COMPLIANT**

**Rule 5**: Must finish with `Archive_Record` with nothing after
- Last activity: #11 `Archive_Record`
- **COMPLIANT**

**Non-compliant**

Justification:
1. Rule 2 violation: `Risk_Assessment` (activity #9) occurs after `Ship_Goods` (activity #8), but the rule requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods` when `Expedite_Flag` is present.
2. Rule 3 violation: `Three_way_match` (activity #10) occurs 4 activities after `Goods_Received` (activity #6), exceeding the maximum distance of 2 activities.
