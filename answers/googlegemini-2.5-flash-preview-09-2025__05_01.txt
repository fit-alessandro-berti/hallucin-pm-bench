To enforce the 48-hour SLA for reaching **Task\_Triage** without adding new tasks, introduce a Timer Boundary Event on **Task\_Receive** set for 48 hours.

Specifically: Replace a **Task** with a **Receive Task** (still ID: **Task\_Receive**) and attach an intermediate Timer Catch Event (e.g., ID: **Timer\_SLA**) configured with a duration of `PT48H`.

If the timer triggers (SLA breach), the Timer Event's flow should bypass the existing sequence flow (**f2**, **f3**, **GW\_Docs**, **f4**, **f5**, **f6**) and transition directly to the **Task\_Triage**, effectively auto-escalating the claim by skipping the document handling steps. The flow entering **Task\_Triage** via the timer path represents the escalation path.
