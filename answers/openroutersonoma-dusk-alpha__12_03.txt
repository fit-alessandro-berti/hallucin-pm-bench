No

### Justification
The FACT is inaccurate because there is at least one case where "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order" with no intervening activities. Specifically:

- In CaseID C002, the sequence is: Receive_Order (09:30:00) → Pack_Items (09:50:00) → Validate_Payment (10:05:00). Here, "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," violating the "immediately after with no other activities in between" condition.

In the other cases, "Validate_Payment" does follow immediately after "Receive_Order" (C001, C003, C004), but the presence of a counterexample in C002 is sufficient to falsify the claim that it "always" occurs this way.
