I cannot compute the average cycle time of the activity “Approve Invoice,” its standard deviation, or the 95% confidence interval because the event log stub provided contains no actual data entries—only the column headers are visible, and all rows and timestamp values have been redacted. Without any recorded start and complete times for the “Approve Invoice” activity, it is impossible to calculate these time-based metrics.
