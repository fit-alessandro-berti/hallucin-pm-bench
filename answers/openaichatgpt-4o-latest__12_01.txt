The fact is inaccurate.

Justification:  
In Case 1001 and Case 1003, “Update_Inventory” occurs before “Authorize_Refund,” not after. Specifically:

- Case 1001:
  - Update_Inventory at 08:25:55  
  - Authorize_Refund at 08:30:02  

- Case 1003:
  - Update_Inventory at 10:08:07  
  - Authorize_Refund at 10:22:18  

Therefore, “Authorize_Refund” does not always occur immediately before “Update_Inventory.”
