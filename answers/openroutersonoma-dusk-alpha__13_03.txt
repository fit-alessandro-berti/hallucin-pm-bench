1️⃣ The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs 1 time in this excerpt (in CaseID 1002 at 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).

2️⃣ This snippet covers only a few hours on March 1, 2025, with just three cases, one of which involves a manual fraud check. An analyst might misestimate frequency by extrapolating this small sample to the full month, overlooking potential daily variations, workload peaks later in the day or month, or case-specific triggers (e.g., automatic vs. manual paths). Without broader data, this could inflate or deflate perceived commonality, ignoring the log's 31-day span and thousands of potential cases. (78 words)
