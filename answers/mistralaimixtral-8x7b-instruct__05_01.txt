 To bring the "FastClaimOnboarding" process into SLA, we can introduce a timer event to monitor the time between the start of the process and the "Triage Claim" task. If the 48-hour SLA is not met, an interrupting boundary timer event can be added to the "Triage Claim" task (element ID: Task_Triage). This event will auto-escalate the claim, ensuring SLA compliance. The timer's activation (using the 'activationGroup' attribute) should be set to cover only the relevant sequence flow, i.e., from the start event to Task_Triage, to avoid interrupting other flow paths. This improvement will help meet the SLA without adding new activities, as required.
