 1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs 1 time in this fragment.
2. This activity represents 1/18 ≈ 0.0556 or 5.56% of all logged events.
3. The case identifier(s) that contain **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** is A1002.
4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of monthly frequency of manual fraud checks from this fragment is unreliable are:
   a. Small sample size: With only 18 events in the fragment, it does not provide a large enough sample to accurately estimate the monthly frequency.
   b. Non-random sampling: The event log is a sequence of events for a single day, not a random sample from a month. This means the frequency of manual fraud checks in this fragment may not reflect the true frequency in a random selection of events from a month.
