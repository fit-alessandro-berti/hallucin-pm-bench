1. **No**  
2. The FACT is incorrect. Here are the relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences:  
   - **C002**: `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment` (an activity `Pack_Items` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`).  
   - **C004**: `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment` (an activity `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`).  

   In these cases, `Validate_Payment` does **not** immediately follow `Receive_Order` without intervening activities.
