Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Brief
To: COO, Acme Insurance
From: Senior Process Performance Analyst

Based on Q1 data, three key activities require immediate focus due to significant performance challenges:

Review Documents: This activity exhibits the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), driven by its high average processing time (25 min), considerable variability (stdev 9 min), and a notable rework rate (5.3%).
Action: Investigate root causes for rework and processing time variation influencing SLA breaches.

Request Documents: Shows the most severe bottlenecks with an exceptionally high 150-min average wait time and a very high 22.0% rework rate. This significantly impacts downstream throughput.
Action: Analyze root causes for the high rework rate and propose solutions to reduce queueing time.

Initial Assessment: Positioned early in the process, this step contributes significantly to the initial throughput drop (280 to 270 cases/day). It has a notable 18-min wait time and relatively high processing time (12 min).
Action: Assess resource allocation and workflow efficiency specifically for the Initial Assessment team.
