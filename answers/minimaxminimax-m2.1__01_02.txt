# Acme Bank Micro-loan Fast-Track: Decision Points and Required Documents

## Decision Points

The process contains two critical decision gates that determine the workflow:

**1. Underwriter Alignment Gate** (Step 5)
At this gate, the system compares the risk scores assigned by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B. If the scores differ by **2 points or less**, the process continues to Step 6. If the scores differ by **more than 2 points**, the application is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision before proceeding.

**2. Amount Threshold Decision** (Step 7)
This gate determines the final approval authority based on loan size. If the requested amount is **less than €15,000**, the system auto-approves the application and proceeds directly to disbursement. If the amount is **€15,000 or greater**, the application moves to Step 8 for Final Micro-loan Board Approval.
