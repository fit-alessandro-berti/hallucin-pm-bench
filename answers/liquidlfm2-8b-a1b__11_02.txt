**Executive Memo: Claims Handling Process Performance Review**

The Q1–2025 Claims Handling process shows Q3 key bottlenecks across core activities. The three worst performers are:  

1. **Request Documents**: Highest avg wait time (18 min) and rework rate (22%), with avg processing time just 4 minutes—indicating delays in external coordination hampering workflow starts and increasing error cycles.  
2. **Approve Claim (Stdev: 9 min)**: Despite short avg processing (6 min), its 9-minute variability reveals inconsistent decision quality, causing SLA breaches (12.4 min avg) and downstream delays.  
3. **Review Documents**: Longest avg processing (30 min) and SLA breach (12.4 min), driven by complex case evaluation. High variability amplifies unpredictability and downtime.  

Recommendations:  
- For **Request Documents**: Implement automated document pre-approval checks to reduce exogenous delays.  
- For **Approve Claim**: Introduce standardized assessment templates and training to reduce variability.  
- For **Review Documents**: Automate initial document validation to cut processing time and improve consistency.  

Data confirms performance gaps stem from coordination lags, inconsistent decision-making, and inefficiency—targeted interventions here can significantly improve throughput and SLA compliance.
