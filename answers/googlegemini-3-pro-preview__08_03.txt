Based on the analysis of the Petri net provided, here is the answer to your query.

**Answer:** Yes

It is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**. transition **T2b** acts as a "bypass" or shortcut, moving a token from place **pa** directly to **pd**, effectively skipping the path containing **T3** (which sits between **pc** and **pd**).

**Shortest Firing Sequence:**
1.  **T1** (consumes p0 $\to$ produces pa, pb)
2.  **T2b** (consumes pa $\to$ produces pd)
3.  **T4** (consumes pb $\to$ produces pe)
4.  **T5** (consumes pd, pe $\to$ produces pf)

*(Note: The order of steps 2 and 3 is interchangeable; **T1, T4, T2b, T5** is also a valid shortest sequence.)*
