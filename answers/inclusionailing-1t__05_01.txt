Add a **timer intermediate event** after Task_Check to enforce the 48-hour SLA to Triage. If the path through Task_RequestDocs causes the total time from Start_Claim to Task_Triage to exceed 48 hours, the timer triggers an escalation (e.g., send alert) without adding tasks.  

Specifically:  
- Insert a **parallel gateway** after Task_Check (before GW_Docs).  
- From there, one flow goes to GW_Docs (existing logic), another triggers a **timer catch event** set for 48 hours from Start_Claim.  
- The timer’s outgoing flow routes directly to Task_Triage *and* sends an escalation notification via existing **Task_Notify**, reusing it by attaching an interrupting boundary event or connecting escalation as a message flow input.  
This ensures Triage starts within SLA—either via docs completion or auto-escalation—without new tasks. Uses only events and gateways with current elements (Start_Claim, f3, f5–f9).
