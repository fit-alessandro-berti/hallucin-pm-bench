Given the provided artefacts, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time (or any other metric) for the activity "Approve Invoice" because:

The event log (Artefact A) contains no actual data rows or timestamps, only column headers. Without the raw event data (e.g., start and complete times for "Approve Invoice" cases), no statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, or confidence intervals) can be performed. The SLA catalogue (Artefact B) provides historical benchmarks but does not contain the specific data needed for the requested calculations. Thus, the task cannot be completed with the given information.
