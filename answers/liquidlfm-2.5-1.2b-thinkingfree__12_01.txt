No, the stated fact is inaccurate. In the provided event log, within **Case 1001**, the sequence **Update_Inventory** occurs prior to **Authorize_Refund** (Impossible: Update at 08:25, Authorize at 08:30), contradicting the assertion. Thus, "Authorize_Refund" does not precede "Update_Inventory" in the same case. The data specifically contradicts the claim. - (Based strictly on provided data, no supporting evidence confirms adherence to the fact.)
