Based solely on the provided event log header:

1)  **The requested average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived.**

2)  **Explanation:** The event log header provided *only* contains the columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `resource`. Crucially, **timestamps** (start and end times for each activity) and **elapsed-time** fields have been explicitly redacted ("timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted"). Cycle time calculation requires the duration of each activity instance, which is derived from timestamps or elapsed time data. Since this data is completely absent from the provided log, it is impossible to calculate the duration of any activity, including "Review Contract", let alone its average across cases. The historical benchmark provided is irrelevant as it is from a different customer segment and not derived from this specific log data.
