**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1 violation**: The purchase order (PO) has a total amount of €12,300, which exceeds the €10,000 threshold. According to Rule 1, **two approvals** are required: first by a *Procurement Officer* and then by the *CFO*, **before** activity `Issue_PO`. In this trace, `Approve_PO` (by Procurement Officer) and `Approve_PO_CFO` (by CFO) occur **before** `Issue_PO`, so this rule is **satisfied**.

2. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains the activity `Expedite_Flag`. According to Rule 2, this makes `Quality_Check` optional, which is not violated. However, `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Risk_Assessment` occurs **after** `Ship_Goods`. This is **not compliant** with Rule 2.

3. **Rule 3 compliance**: After `Goods_Received` (activity #6), the activity `Three_way_match` occurs at activity #10. The number of activities between #6 and #10 is **4** (activities #7, #8, #9, #10), which is **greater than 2**. Therefore, Rule 3 is **violated**.

4. **Rule 4 compliance**: Activity #7 is executed by the *Intern* and follows the activity #6, which is executed by the *Warehouse_Clerk*. There is **no activity executed by the CFO immediately before an activity executed by the Intern**, so Rule 4 is **not violated**.

5. **Rule 5 compliance**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (activity #11), and there are no activities after it. Therefore, Rule 5 is **satisfied**.

**Conclusion**: The trace is **Non-compliant**, as it violates **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**.
