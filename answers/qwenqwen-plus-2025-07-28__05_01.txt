Add an intermediate timer event after "Start_Claim" to monitor the 48-hour SLA. Insert a **boundary timer event** on "Task_Receive" with a duration of "PT48H". If the task isn't completed within 48 hours, the timer triggers and redirects flow to an escalation path. However, since no new tasks can be added, reuse an existing escalation path by redirecting the timer to "Task_Triage" via sequence flow to ensure triage occurs. This ensures claims are triaged within SLA. Update flow to allow timer bypass if already completed.  

**Affected elements**: Add boundary timer on `Task_Receive`, link to `Task_Triage` with conditional logic to avoid duplication.
