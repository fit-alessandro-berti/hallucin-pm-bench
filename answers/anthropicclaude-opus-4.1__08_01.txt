I need to analyze whether T5 can fire before T3 in any reachable marking of this Petri net.

Let me trace through the possible executions from the initial marking M0 = (1,0,0,0,0,0,0).

**Initial state:** p0 has 1 token, all other places empty.

**Step 1:** Only T1 can fire (requires token in p0)
- T1 fires: M0 → M1 = (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)
- Now p1 and p2 each have 1 token

**Step 2:** From M1, we can fire T2 or T3
- If T2 fires: M1 → M2 = (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)
  - p3 has 1 token, p2 has 1 token, p4 is empty
- If T3 fires: M1 → M3 = (0,1,0,0,1,0,0)
  - p1 has 1 token, p4 has 1 token, p3 is empty

**Analyzing T5's firing conditions:**
T5 requires:
- 1 token in p3 (normal arc)
- 0 tokens in p4 (inhibitor arc)

**From marking M2** (after T1→T2):
- p3 = 1 token ✓
- p4 = 0 tokens ✓
- **T5 is enabled and can fire!**

Therefore, the sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** allows T5 to fire before T3.

**Answer: YES**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Concrete firing sequence:** T1 → T2 → T5

**Justification:** After T1 fires, both parallel branches are initiated (tokens in p1 and p2). If we fire T2 first (consuming the token from p1 and producing one in p3), we reach a marking where p3 has a token and p4 is still empty (since T3 hasn't fired yet). This satisfies T5's enabling condition: it needs a token in p3 and zero tokens in p4 (due to the inhibitor arc). Thus T5 can fire before T3 ever fires.
