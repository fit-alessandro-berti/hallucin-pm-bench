**Answer 1.** Yes, T5 can fire before T3.

**Answer 2.**  
A minimal firing sequence is:  

**T1, T2, T7, T4, T5**

Explanation:  
- T1: M0 = {P0} → {P1, P2}  
- T2: {P1, P2} → {P2, P3}  
- T7: {P2, P3} → {P2, P4}  
- T4: {P2, P4} → {P2, P5}  
- T5: {P2, P5} → {P6}  

Here T5 fires using the token in P2 before T3 ever occurs; afterward P2 is empty, so T3 can no longer fire.
