**Executive Memo: Process Bottlenecks and Improvement Opportunities**  

The three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:  

1. **Request_Documents** (Avg: 36.5h, 95p: 120.0h)  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter** (Avg: 12.2h, 95p: 44.0h)  
3. **Assess_Liability** (Avg: 7.8h, 95p: 16.4h)  

**Recommendations:**  
- **Request_Documents**: Automate document requests via a digital portal to reduce manual follow-ups (target: 20% reduction).  
- **Send_Closure_Letter**: Implement a centralized email system with automated templates to cut delays (target: 20% reduction).  
- **Assess_Liability**: Introduce a triage system to prioritize complex cases, reducing idle time (target: 20% reduction).  

These actions are data-driven and focused on reducing waiting time.
