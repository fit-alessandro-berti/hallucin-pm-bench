Of course. Here is the analysis based solely on the provided data.

1.  The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1** time in the excerpt.

2.  a) Percentage of all *events* (48 total): (1 / 48) * 100 = **2.08%**
    b) Percentage of all *unique cases* (12 total): (1 / 12) * 100 = **8.33%**

3.  A low-support activity like this, present in only one case, is an outlier. Performance metrics (e.g., average duration) for this path are based on a single data point, making them statistically insignificant. Predictive models trained on this log would likely overfit to the common path (`Auto_Fraud_Check`) and fail to accurately predict the rare, resource-intensive `Manual` path, leading to unreliable forecasts and resource planning.
