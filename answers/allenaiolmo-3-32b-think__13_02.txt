3. Low-support activities like "Manual_Fraud_Check" risk distorting analysis because rare events may represent edge cases critical to understanding process variability. With only one instance here, models or metrics could overlook dependencies (e.g., manual checks might correlate with higher-risk claims or unique fraud patterns). This scarcity may lead to underestimating their impact on outcomes (e.g., approval rates) or misrepresenting process bottlenecks, as generalizations based on frequent activities (e.g., "Auto_Fraud_Check") fail to capture rare but significant behaviors.
