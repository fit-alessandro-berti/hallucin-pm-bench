**Answer:** No

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1**: The `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) activities must occur once each and in that order.
In the given trace, `QE` occurs before `Notify_Authorities` and `RA` follows `Notify_Authorities`. This violates the required order of QE followed by RA.**Violation of Rule 1**.
2. **Rule 2**: If the case-level attribute `severity = "High"`, the `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) activity must happen **after both QE and RA**.
In the given trace, `VP` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` and `QE`, but not after `RA`. This violates the requirement for VP to occur strictly after QE and RA.**Violation of Rule 2**.
3. **Rule 3**: The `Notify_Authorities` (NA) activity must not occur until after `QE` and `RA` are complete.
In the given trace, `NA` occurs before `RA`, which violates the rule that NA must occur only after both QE and RA are completed.**Violation of Rule 3**.
4. **Rule 4**: The `Close_Case` (CC) activity may occur only after `NA` (and, if required by Rule 2, after VP).
Since `NA` is already out of order, this rule is not applicable for evaluation in this trace.**No explicit violation or compliance here**.

In summary, **trace 2025-05-RX17 is non-compliant with all applicable rules** due to the improper sequencing of QE, RA, and NA, as well as the premature execution of VP.
