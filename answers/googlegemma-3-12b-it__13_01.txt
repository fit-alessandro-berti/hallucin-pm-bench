1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time.
2. There are a total of 18 events in the log. One event is "Manual_Fraud_Check", so the percentage is 1 / 18 = 0.0556. Rounded to two decimal places, this is 5.56%.
3. The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is A1002.
4. Here are two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:

    *   **Small Sample Size:** The fragment contains only 18 events, which is a small sample size. Extrapolating to a monthly frequency based on such a small sample may not accurately reflect the overall pattern over a longer period.
    *   **Time Bias:** The fragment is limited to a single day (2025-05-01). The frequency of "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" could vary significantly from day to day or across different times of the month, and this fragment does not capture that variation.
