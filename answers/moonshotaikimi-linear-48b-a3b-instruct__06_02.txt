Therefore, I need to go through the description of Process B – Custom Furniture Manufacturing and identify all places where tasks can run "in parallel" or "may proceed in parallel."

The key phrase is "may execute concurrently," which means that for each parallelism block, any tasks listed there can happen simultaneously.

The description is:

Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing  
1. Accept_Custom_Order  
2. (Parallel Block P1) → Generate_CAD_Drawing  ||  Confirm_Materials_Availability  
3. Once P1 completes → (Parallel Block P2) → Milling_Panels  ||  Turning_Legs  ||  CNC_Detailing  
4. Dry_Fit_Assembly  
5. Glue_And_Clamp  
6. (Parallel Block P3) → Sand_Surfaces  ||  Apply_Stain  ||  Install_Hardware  
7. Final_Inspection

I need to identify each parallel block and list the tasks within each block.

Parallel Block P1: Generate_CAD_Drawing and Confirm_Materials_Availability. So that is one set: "Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability".

Parallel Block P2: Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing. So that is another set: "Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing".

Parallel Block P3: Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware. So a third set: "Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware".

Now, I need to list each set as a line, separated by commas. The order of tasks within a set might not matter, but the description shows the order: I should preserve the order listed in the document.

The tasks in P1 are ordered as: Generate_CAD_Drawing first then Confirm_Materials_Availability. So I'll list them in that order.

P2: Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing. Good.

P3: Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware. Good.

Now, I should not mention any tasks from A or C. Also exclude tasks that must run sequentially. In this process, there are tasks that are sequential (like Dry_Fit_Assembly, Glue_And_Clamp, Final_Inspection) but they are not part of any parallel block. However, the question says "exclude any tasks that must run sequentially." Does that mean we ignore them entirely? The question says "Only considering Process B... enumerate every set of tasks that may execute concurrently". So we only consider the tasks that appear in the parallel blocks. The sequential tasks are not part of any concurrency set, so we exclude them.

Thus the answer should be three lines:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

Thus, final answer as numbered lines.

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware
