1. **“Manual_Fraud_Check” occurrences:** **1** time.

2. **Percentage of all logged events:**  
   - Total events in the fragment: **18**  
   - Manual fraud checks: **1**  
   - Percentage = \( \frac{1}{18} \times 100 \) = **5.56%** (rounded to two decimals)

3. **Case(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”:** **A1002**

4. **Two sampling-related reasons the monthly estimate is unreliable (using only this fragment):**
   - **Too small a sample size:** Only **18 events / 4 cases** are observed, with just **1** fraud-check occurrence; this makes any rate estimate highly variable and sensitive to random chance.
   - **Non-representative time window:** All events occur on a **single date (2025-05-01)**, so this is not a sample spanning a month; it may miss day-to-day/weekly variation and cannot reliably represent a full month’s behavior.
