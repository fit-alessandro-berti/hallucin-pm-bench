Below is the answer broken down by parts:

──────────────────────────────
a) Decision Points

1. Risk/Amount Branch (Step 4): If the Tri-Color Risk Check results in a Low or Medium risk rating and the requested loan amount is at most €250,000, then the process skips the manual underwriting review (Step 5); otherwise, the application proceeds to manual underwriting.
2. TriVote Approval (Step 6): The application must pass a “TriVote” decision gate where all three roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) must review the case and any two approvals out of the three are sufficient for the application to pass.

b) Documents in Order of First Appearance

1. Form 14B (collected at application receipt in Step 1)
2. Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow (used as inputs in the Tri-Color Risk Check in Step 3)
3. Deck Memo (created during the Manual Underwriting Review in Step 5)
4. Offer Sheet 77 (prepared as the binding offer in Step 7)
5. Signed Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration (returned by the applicant as confirmation in Step 8)
6. Loan Dossier 2025 (final agreement document produced in Step 9)
