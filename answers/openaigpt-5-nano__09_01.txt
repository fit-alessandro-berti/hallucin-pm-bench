Cannot derive the requested average cycle time from the provided data.

Why:
- The log excerpt includes only case_id, activity, and resource. Timestamps and elapsed-time values are redacted, so there are no durations to compute how long the “Review Contract” activity took per case.

What I can say from the data:
- “Review Contract” appears in 4 cases: C-001, C-002, C-003, and C-004.

What you’d need to compute the average:
- Per-event durations for the “Review Contract” occurrences (e.g., the time from the previous event to the start of “Review Contract,” or from the end of “Review Contract” to the next event), or explicit elapsed times for each “Review Contract” instance.
- With those, compute the four durations, then average them (sum/4).

If you provide timestamps/elapsed times for each event, I’ll calculate the exact average cycle time in hours and show the brief calculation.
