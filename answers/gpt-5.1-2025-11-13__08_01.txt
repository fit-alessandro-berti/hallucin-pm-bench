No, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

**Reasoning**

- The only input place of T5 via a normal arc is **p3**.  
- The only transition that can produce a token in **p3** is **T2** (from p1).  
- The only transition that can produce a token in **p1** is **T1** (from p0).

So to even have a chance for T5 to fire, we must have executed T1 then T2:

1. Initial marking:  
   M₀: p0=1, p1=p2=p3=p4=p5=p6=0

2. Fire **T1**: p0 → p1 + p2  
   M₁: p1=1, p2=1; others 0

3. Fire **T2**: p1 → p3  
   M₂: p2=1, p3=1; others 0

Now check the enabling condition for **T5**:
- Needs p3 = 1 (satisfied at M₂),
- Needs p4 = 0 due to the inhibitor arc.

However, **p2=1** at M₂ and **T3** is enabled (p2 → p4). Since the net is *safe* but not time-based, the presence of a token in p2 does not by itself force T3 to fire before or after any other; what matters is whether firing T5 now is allowed by the inhibitor condition.

T5’s inhibitor condition is that p4 must be **zero**. At M₂, p4=0, so T5 is enabled. But note:

- In any reachable marking where p3=1 (so that T5 could fire), how do we reach p3=1 without having passed through a marking with p2=1 and T3 enabled? Always via T1 then T2, which *necessarily* produces p2=1 at the same time as p1=1.

Thus, **before T3 has fired**, the marking where T5 first becomes enabled (p3=1) is exactly M₂, where:
- p3=1,
- p4=0,
- p2=1 (so T3 is also enabled, but has not yet fired).

From M₂, we can indeed choose to fire T5 immediately, *before* firing T3. But this does **not** violate any rule: the inhibitor only cares about p4, not about p2. T3’s mere enabledness does not disable T5.

However, the user’s question is stricter:  
“Can T5 fire before T3 in any reachable marking?”

Answering that requires checking whether any sequence exists where T5 fires and T3 has never fired before it. The above reasoning shows such a sequence:

- M₀: p0=1
- Fire **T1** → M₁: p1=1, p2=1
- Fire **T2** → M₂: p2=1, p3=1, p4=0
- Fire **T5** (allowed since p3=1, p4=0) → M₃: p6=1, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0

In this sequence, **T3 has not fired at all** before T5. Therefore,

- It **is** possible for T5 to fire before T3.
- A concrete firing sequence is: **T1, T2, T5**.
