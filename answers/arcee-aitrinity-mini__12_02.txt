The claim that *Validate_Payment* always *follows* *Receive_Order* is **not** verified by the log, as demonstrated by the following line numbers:  
C003 (line 6: *Validate_Payment* precedes Receive_Order in line 7), and C005 (line 11: *Validate_Payment* has no preceding *Receive_Order* in this segment). Additionally, C002 and C004 show valid sequence compliance, but these cases do not negate the failures, confirming the statement overgeneralizes the order.
