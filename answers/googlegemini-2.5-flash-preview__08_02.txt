**Answer 1:** No.

**Answer 2:**  Transition T5 has P2 as an input place. Transition T3 also consumes a token from P2. For T5 to fire, it needs a token in P2. This token originates from the firing of T1. After T1 fires, both P1 and P2 get a token. T5 additionally requires a token in P5. The only ways a token appears in P5 is through the firing of T4 (which requires P4), which is reached via T7 (from P3) or T3 (from P2). To fire T3, a token must be in P2, which is consumed by T3. Therefore, T5 cannot fire without P2 having held a token, and if T3 fires, it removes that token. T5 needs tokens in both P2 and P5. To get a token in P5, either T7 or T3 must fire, both of which require a previous token flow initiated by T1 providing a token to P2. If T3 fires, it consumes the token needed by T5 in P2. Thus, T3 must occur or be enabled before T5 could even potentially be enabled via the T4 path. T3 must fire before T5 can fire *through the T4 dependency on T3*, but even if T4 is enabled via T7, T5 still needs the token in P2, which T3 could consume. T5's requirement for P2 means T3 must not have fired immediately before T5, but the *possibility* of T3 firing is inherent in the flow where T5 is enabled. Therefore, T3 must have been enabled if T5 is enabled through the path involving P2, meaning T3 is always *able* to fire concurrent to or before the conditions for T5 are met via the T4 path. Since T5 requires P2 *and* P5, and the token for P2 is available after T1, and the token for P5 comes through a path that can involve T3, T3 will always be reachable before or at the same time the preconditions for T5 are met. T5 needs a token in P2; T3 uses the token in P2. T3 is enabled by the same event that provides the needed token in P2 for T5. Thus, T3 is available to fire whenever T5 gets its required token in P2. The only path for T5 to fire requires a token in P5 which arises from T4. T4 can be reached by T3. If T5 fires, T3 must not have consumed the token in P2. But T3 is *always* enabled from T1 onwards whenever P2 has a token. T3 must not have fired *immediately* before T5, but T3 is always available to fire before T5 can be fully enabled via the path involving T4.

In summary, T5 requires a token in P2. This token comes from T1. T3 also requires a token in P2 and consumes it. Therefore, if T3 fires, T5 cannot fire until another token reaches P2 (which is not possible in this net). For T5 to fire, T3 must *not* have fired. This means T3 must be "behind" T5 in any sequence leading to T5 firing.
