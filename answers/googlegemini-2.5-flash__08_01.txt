Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire *before* transition T3.

**Concrete Firing Sequence:** T1, T2, T5

**Justification:**

1.  **Initial Marking:** {p0:1}. Only T1 is enabled.
2.  **Fire T1:** Consumes 1 from p0, produces 1 into p1 and 1 into p2.
    *   **Marking:** {p1:1, p2:1}
    *   At this point, both T2 (requires p1) and T3 (requires p2) are enabled. T5 is not enabled as p3 contains 0 tokens.
3.  **Fire T2:** (We choose to fire T2 before T3). Consumes 1 from p1, produces 1 into p3.
    *   **Marking:** {p2:1, p3:1}
    *   In this marking:
        *   T3 is *still enabled* because p2 still contains 1 token (it has not yet fired).
        *   T5 is now enabled because it requires p3 (which has 1 token) AND p4 (which has 0 tokens, as T3 has not yet fired).
4.  **Fire T5:** (T5 is enabled in the current marking). Consumes 1 from p3, produces 1 into p6.
    *   **Marking:** {p2:1, p6:1}
    *   At this point, T5 has fired. T3 has still not fired (p2 still contains 1 token).

This sequence demonstrates that T5 can fire while T3 is enabled but has not yet fired, and thus T5 fires before T3.
