Okay, I need to summarize the decision points in Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track process and list all the required documents exactly as per the given system information. Let me carefully go through each step and note down where decisions occur and what documents are mentioned.

First, let's identify the decision points in the process:

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)**: Confirming ID card and mobile phone, which is a pass/fail decision.
2. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: If Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B's risk scores differ by more than 2 points, it escalates to the Harmonization Committee. Otherwise, continue.
3. **Amount Threshold Decision**: If the loan amount is less than €15,000, the system auto-approves. If it's €15,000 or more, it requires Board approval.
4. **Final Micro-Loan Board Approval**: If the amount is ≥ €15,000, the Board approves or rejects.

So, the key decision points are:
- If KYC fails, the application might be rejected.
- Whether the scores from the two Underwriters align or need Harmonization Committee intervention.
- The determination based on loan amount: auto-approve or need for Board approval.
- Final Board's decision on larger loans.

Now, for the required documents listed under "Required documents at submission time":
1. Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
2. Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
3. Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
4. Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
5. Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
6. Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)

I need to note that the process explicitly skips credit history checks and doesn't require any credit-bureau pull, which aligns with the non-standard nature mentioned. The document names should be exactly as provided in the list.

One thing to ensure is that all document names are listed correctly, using the exact labels: Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01), Proof of Address (which includes the age), Latest Income Statement, Community Impact Statement (CIS) template, Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet, and Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF).

For the decision points, I need to describe them concisely using the exact activity names from the process, avoiding any standard loan terminology. So, instead of saying "loan approval," I'll refer to the specific approval gates mentioned.

Put it all together in a clear, organized response.
