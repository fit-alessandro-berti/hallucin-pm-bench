  - *All tasks use strict mandated terms:*  
    - "KYC Review" replaces "customer due diligence".

  - "IT Support" is included verbatim from the source text.  
- **Coverage:**

  - **Transaction Analyst** handles frontline activities (logging, screening, releasing payments).  
  - **IT Support** owns technical execution (SWIFT, archiving).  
  - **Regulatory Liaison** is **Informed** post-archiving (step 6).
