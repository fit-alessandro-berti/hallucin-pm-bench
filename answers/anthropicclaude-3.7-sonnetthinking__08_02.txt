# Analysis of Petri Net PN-8

## Question 1
Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

## Question 2
The minimal firing sequence that demonstrates this is: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

## Explanation
When T1 fires (AND-split), tokens are placed in both P1 and P2. From this marking, we have two parallel paths:
- Path 1: P1 → T2 → P3 → T7 → P4
- Path 2: P2 → T3 → P4

If we follow Path 1 (T2, T7), the token in P2 remains untouched. After T4 fires (consuming from P4 and producing in P5), we have tokens in both P2 and P5, enabling T5 to fire. This entire sequence occurs without ever firing T3, demonstrating that T5 can fire before T3.
