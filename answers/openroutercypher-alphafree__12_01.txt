No, the claim is not accurate.

Reviewing the relevant cases:

- **Case 1001**  
    - Sequence: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued  
    - **Authorize_Refund** occurs *after* **Update_Inventory**.  
- **Case 1003** presents the same order:  
    - Sequence: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund  
    - Again, **Authorize_Refund** occurs *after* **Update_Inventory**.  

Since “Authorize_Refund” appears to always come *after* “Update_Inventory”—rather than before—the claim lacks support in the data fragment.
