**Answer: Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**  

The shortest firing sequence that makes this happen is  

```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```

*(the order of T2b and T4 can be swapped; both give the same length)*

### Why this works  

1. **Initial marking** M₀ :  p0 = 1, all other places = 0  

2. **Fire T1** (parallel split)  

   - consumes the token from *p0*  
   - produces one token in *pa* and one token in *pb*  

   Marking M₁ : pa = 1 , pb = 1  

3. **Fire T2b** (shortcut)  

   - consumes the token from *pa*  
   - produces a token in *pd* (no token ever reaches *pc* or *pc → pd* yet)  

   Marking M₂ : pd = 1 , pb = 1  

4. **Fire T4**  

   - consumes the token from *pb*  
   - produces a token in *pe*  

   Marking M₃ : pd = 1 , pe = 1  

5. **Fire T5** (synchronising join)  

   - consumes the token from *pd* and the token from *pe*  
   - produces a token in *pf*  

   Marking M₄ : pf = 1  

At the moment **T5 fires**, the transition **T3** has never been enabled nor fired; the only way the token arrived in *pd* was via **T2b**, the shortcut that bypasses *pc* and therefore bypasses **T3**.

### Minimality argument  

* To enable **T5** we need a token in **pd** *and* a token in **pe**.  
* Tokens in **pd** can only be produced by **T2b** (shortcut) or by **T3** (which we want to avoid).  
* Tokens in **pe** can only be produced by **T4**.  

Both **T2b** and **T4** require the tokens created by **T1** (the only transition that puts tokens into *pa* and *pb*). Consequently any run that lets **T5** fire before **T3** must contain at least:

1. **T1** – to create *pa* and *pb*  
2. **T2b** – to create *pd* without using **T3**  
3. **T4** – to create *pe*  
4. **T5** – the target transition  

Thus four transition firings are the **minimum** possible; any shorter sequence would lack either the required token in *pd* or the required token in *pe*.  

Hence the sequence `T1, T2b, T4, T5` (or `T1, T4, T2b, T5`) is the shortest one that lets **T5** fire before **T3**.
