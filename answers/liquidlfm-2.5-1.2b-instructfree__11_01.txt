**Executive Memo: Process Performance – Waiting-Time Analysis**

Over the past year, our process mining analysis revealed three activities with the highest average waiting times, strictly by waiting-time:

1. **Submit_Claim** – average waiting time: 1.2 (95th percentile: 1.2) – Recommendation: Streamline submission forms to reduce evaluation delays.  
2. **Approve_Payment** – average waiting time: 9.7 (95th percentile: 9.7) – Recommendation: Automate approval workflows with AI-based risk assessment.  
3. **Reject_Claim** – average waiting time: 1.8 (95th percentile: 0.6) – Recommendation: Implement real-time validation checklists to expedite decision-making.

Addresses of these bottlenecks directly benefit process efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Subject: Address Top Waiting-Time Performance Issues  

Please focus on the proposed data-driven actions to cut waiting times by at least 20% across these activities. Your immediate attention to this will have a measurable impact on Orion’s operational performance.
