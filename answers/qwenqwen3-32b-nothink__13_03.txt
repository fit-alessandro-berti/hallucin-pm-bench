1️⃣ The **exact** activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because this snippet shows only a few cases and a short time window. For example, Case 1002 is the only one with a manual fraud check, while others use automatic checks. This could suggest manual checks are rare, but in reality, they might be more common under different conditions (e.g., high-risk applications). The limited sample size and lack of context (e.g., case attributes) can lead to biased conclusions about process behavior.
