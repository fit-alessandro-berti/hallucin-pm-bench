# SLA Improvement Recommendation

Add a boundary timer event to "Task_Check" set for 48 hours that connects directly to "Task_Triage". This creates an auto-escalation path that bypasses the documentation gateway when the SLA threshold is approached.

```
<bpmn:boundaryEvent id="Timer_48h" attachedToRef="Task_Check">
  <bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
    <bpmn:timeDuration>P2D</bpmn:timeDuration>
  </bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
</bpmn:boundaryEvent>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="f_escalate" sourceRef="Timer_48h" targetRef="Task_Triage"/>
```

This ensures claims reach triage within the 48-hour window even when documentation is incomplete, satisfying the SLA while maintaining the normal flow for properly documented claims.
