**No**

**Justification:**
*   **Rule 1 (Satisfied):** `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, and both appear exactly once.
*   **Rule 2 (Satisfied):** Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.
*   **Rule 3 (Violated):** `Notify_Authorities` occurs at step 4, but `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` does not occur until step 5. The rule requires NA to happen only after **both** QE and RA are complete.
*   **Rule 4 (Satisfied):** `Close_Case` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.

The trace is non-compliant due to the violation of Rule 3.
