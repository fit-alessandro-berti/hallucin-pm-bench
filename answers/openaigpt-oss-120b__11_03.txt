**Subject: Performance Gaps in Core Processing Activities**  

Our analysis of end‑to‑end processing shows three activities where both SLA adherence and waiting times are most problematic.  

* **Legal Approval** – Avg. throughput 900 s vs SLA 600 s ( +300 s). Avg. waiting 600 s.  
* **Risk Review** – Avg. throughput 600 s vs SLA 300 s ( +300 s). Avg. waiting 480 s.  
* **Credit Assessment** – Avg. throughput 300 s vs SLA 240 s ( +60 s). Avg. waiting 200 s.  

**Recommendations**  
- Implement a streamlined, checklist‑based “fast‑track” legal review for standard offers to cut waiting time by at least 50 %.  
- Deploy a rule‑based, automated risk‑review engine (AI‑assist) to reduce manual handling and achieve a 30 % reduction in total processing time.  
- Re‑balance credit‑assessment workload by adding a dedicated analyst for high‑volume segments, targeting a 40 % drop in waiting time.
