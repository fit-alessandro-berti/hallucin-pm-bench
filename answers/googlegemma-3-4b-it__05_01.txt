Here’s an improvement to ensure the “FastClaimOnboarding” process meets the 48-hour SLA without adding new activities:

Introduce a Timer Event linked to the “Start_Claim” event. Configure this timer to fire after 48 hours. Upon the timer’s activation, immediately reconnect the sequence flow from “Start_Claim” (id: “f1”) back to “Task_Receive” (id: “Task_Receive”). This ensures the claim is immediately processed, preventing it from exceeding the SLA threshold and triggering an automatic escalation – effectively looping the claim back to the beginning for immediate action.
