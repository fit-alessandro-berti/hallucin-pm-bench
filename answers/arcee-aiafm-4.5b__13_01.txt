Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occur in this fragment?**

Looking at the log lines, we find:
- A1002: "Log: Manual_Fraud_Check"
- A1002: "Log: Manual_Fraud_Check"

So, the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **2 times**.

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**

There are 18 log lines in total.
Number of occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check": 2

Percentage = (Number of occurrences / Total number of events) * 100
Percentage = (2 / 18) * 100 = 11.11%

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**

Case identifiers containing "Manual_Fraud_Check":
- A1002

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**

Two sampling-related reasons:
1. **Small total dataset**: With only 18 log lines, the dataset is very small. This makes it difficult to make reliable statistical inferences about monthly frequency.
2. **Lack of patterns or regularity**: The occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check" is limited to a specific part of the sequence (A1002), suggesting potential clustering rather than a uniform monthly pattern. A single cluster might not represent monthly frequency accurately.

Alright, let's summarize our answers:

1. 2
2. 11.11%
3. A1002
4. 1. Small dataset
   2. Lack of regular monthly pattern
