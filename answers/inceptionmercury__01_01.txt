In Contoso Airlines' flight-refund process, there are specific decision points and required documents that guide the flow of the refund claim. Here's a summary:

### Decision Points:
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**:
   - The triage agent decides if the claim is eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**:
   - The finance controller decides to pre-approve the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*.

3. **High-value branch decision:
   - If the refund amount is greater than â‚¬1,000, the case proceeds to *Senior_Auditor_Review*. This is a decision point where the need for an audit is determined.

4. **Senior_Auditor_Review**:
   - The senior auditor reviews the case, which includes examining the *AuditTrail*, to decide on the approval of high-value claims.

5. **Process_Refund_Payment**:
   - The finance team decides to execute the payment once the *BankTransferAuthorization* is signed, and all prior approvals (including the senior auditor's review for high-value claims) are in place.

### Required Documents:
- **RefundRequestForm**: Completed by the passenger to submit the claim.
- **FlightManifest**: Used by the triage agent to validate eligibility.
- **WeatherReport**: Used by the triage agent to validate eligibility.
