Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in some reachable marking of the Petri net.

**Concrete Firing Sequence:**  
T1 → T2 → T5 → T3  

**Justification:**  
- In the initial marking (p0(1), all others 0), transition T1 fires first: it consumes the token from p0 and produces tokens in p1 and p2, resulting in marking M1: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0).  
- In M1, transition T2 fires next: it consumes the token from p1 and produces a token in p3, resulting in marking M2: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0).  
- In M2, since p3 contains a token and p4 is empty (satisfying T5's inhibitor condition), transition T5 fires: it consumes the token from p3 and produces a token in p6, resulting in marking M3: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1).  
- T3 fires later: it consumes the token from p2 and produces a token in p4, resulting in marking M4: p0(0), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(1), p5(0), p6(1).  

In this sequence, T5 fires in marking M3 before T3 fires in marking M4. Thus, T5 fires before T3.

**Key Insight:** T3 is the only transition that produces tokens in p4. If T3 has not yet fired (as in M2, where p4 is empty), T5 can fire when p3 contains a token, as its inhibitor arc from p4 is inactive.
