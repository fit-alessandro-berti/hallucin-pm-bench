**Answer to Question 1:** No.

**Explanation (≤120 words):**  
To fire T5, both P2 and P5 must be marked. P5 is produced only by T4, which requires P4. P4 can be marked either by T3 (from P2) or by T7 (via P1→P3→P4). However, T7 depends on T2, which needs P1, and P1 comes from T1. So the only way to get P5 without T3 is: T1 → T2 → T7 → T4, yielding P5, while P2 remains from T1. Thus, T5 can fire using P2 (from T1) and P5 (from T2–T7–T4), **without T3 ever firing**. Therefore, T5 **can** fire before T3.

**Bonus – Minimal firing sequence:**  
[T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]
