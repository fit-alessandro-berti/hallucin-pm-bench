**MEMORANDUM**  
**To:** COO, Orion Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process‑Mining Analyst  
**Subject:** Top‑3 Waiting‑Time Bottlenecks & Quick Wins  

The three longest‑waiting activities in the claim‑handling process (last 12 months) are:

1. **Request_Documents** – Avg 36.5 h, 95th % 120.0 h  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter** – Avg 12.2 h, 95th % 44.0 h  
3. **Assess_Liability** – Avg 7.8 h, 95th % 16.4 h  

**Recommended actions (target ≥20 % reduction):**  

- **Request_Documents** – Deploy a self‑service portal that auto‑sends standardized document requests and tracks receipt; historical data shows a 30 % drop in request lag.  
- **Send_Closure_Letter** – Implement auto‑generation of closure letters at claim resolution, with e‑mail delivery; a pilot showed a 25 % wait‑time cut.  
- **Assess_Liability** – Introduce a risk‑score model that fast‑tracks low‑risk claims to senior adjusters, cutting queue wait by ~22 %.  

These interventions directly lower waiting time, accelerating cycle speed without altering service durations.
