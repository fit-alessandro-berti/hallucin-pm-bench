| :----------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decision 1: Claim Acceptance & Initial Eligibility** | **Question:** Did the Claim Submittal successfully complete? (The initial act of submission itself is an outcome, but implies the conditions for triage). **Document:** *RefundRequestForm*.    |
| **Decision 2: Triage Eligibility Check**              | **Question:** Based on the submitted form and checking against the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*, is the passenger eligible for a refund? **Documents:** *RefundRequestForm*, *FlightManifest*, *WeatherReport*.                  |
| **Decision 3: Finance Pre-Approval**                  | **Question:** Does the finance controller, using the *EligibilityChecklist*, approve the calculated refund amount? **Document:** *EligibilityChecklist*. (Outcome depends on expert judgment and checklist structure).                |
| **Decision 4: High-Value Review Trigger**             | **Question:** Is the calculated refund value greater than â‚¬1000? (Route selection: High-Value branch OR standard completion). **Decision only, no specific document.**                                  |
| **Decision 5: Payment Authorization**                 | **Question:** **Implementation Condition:** This step is enabled *only after* Decision 3 AND Conditions for Decision 4 (if applicable). *It contains no branch*.

| **Decision 6: Confirmation Issuance**                 | **Question:** **Implementation Condition:** This step is enabled *after* Decision 5 following successful payment authorization. *No conditional branch*, confirmation always sends after payment. **Document:** *RefundConfirmationPDF*. **Action:** Email this PDF to the passenger.                                |
