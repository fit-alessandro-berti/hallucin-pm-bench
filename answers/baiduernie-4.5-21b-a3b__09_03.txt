1. To compute the average cycle time for the "Approve Invoice" activity, we need pairs of start_time and complete_time values for all transactions where the activity is "Approve Invoice". These pairs are missing from the provided artefact (only the header is shown). Without the exact timestamps for when each invoice was initiated (start_time) and completed (complete_time), it is impossible to calculate the cycle time for "Approve Invoice".

2. Since the start_time and complete_time data for "Approve Invoice" activities are unavailable, we cannot calculate the standard deviation or construct a 95% confidence interval for this metric. These calculations rely directly on the timestamp differences for each transaction, which are missing.

3. I cannot compute the required metrics because the event-log stub provides no specific timestamps for the "Approve Invoice" activity or its start and complete times. Essential data required to determine cycle times, standard deviations, or confidence intervals (specific start_time and complete_time values for transactions) are entirely redacted in the provided artefact. Without this data, no valid calculations can be performed.
