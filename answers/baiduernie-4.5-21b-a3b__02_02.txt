Let's answer each question step by step based on the provided XES event log.

### **Q1: How many **distinct cases** are present in this fragment?**

To find the number of distinct cases, we look at the `case` attribute in each event:

1. C001  
2. C002  
3. C001  
4. C003  
5. C002  
6. C003  
7. C001  
8. C002  
9. C003  
10. C002  

The distinct cases are: **“C001”**, **“C002”**, and **“C003”**.

**Answer to Q1:**  
There are **3 distinct cases**.

### **Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

Filter the events for `case="C002"` and list their `concept:name` in chronological order of their `time:timestamp`:

- (2) Receive_Order → (5) Check_Stock → (8) Arrange_Delivery → (10) Ship_Order

**Answer to Q2:**  
The sequence for **“C002”** is:  
```
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
```

---

### **Q3: Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**

First, we collect all events where `concept:name = "Ship_Order"` and note what occurred immediately before them (i.e., the previous event's `concept:name`):

- Line 7: Ship_Order preceded by Check_Stock (C001)
- Line 8: Ship_Order preceded by Arrange_Delivery (C002)
- Line 9: Ship_Order preceded by Ship_Order (C003)
- Line 10: Ship_Order preceded by Ship_Order (C002)

Remove duplicates and sort alphabetically:

**Activities preceding Ship_Order:**  
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
Ship_Order
```

**Answer to Q3:**  
The distinct activities immediately preceding “Ship_Order” (sorted alphabetically) are:  
```
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock  
Ship_Order  
```

---

### **Final Answers:**

**Q1:** There are **3 distinct cases**.  

**Q2:** For case **“C002”**, the sequence is:  
```
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
```

**Q3:** Across all cases, the distinct activities immediately preceding “Ship_Order” (sorted alphabetically) are:  
```
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock  
Ship_Order  
```
