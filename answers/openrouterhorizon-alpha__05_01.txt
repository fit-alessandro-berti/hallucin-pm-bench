Add a boundary timer to Task_Receive to enforce the 48-hour SLA to reach Task_Triage.

Change Start_Claim to a timer-start + message-start combination is unnecessary. Instead:
- Attach an interrupting timer boundary event (e.g., Boundary_Timer_48h) to Task_Receive with timeDuration PT48H.
- On timeout, route directly to Task_Triage via a new sequenceFlow (e.g., f2_timeout) that bypasses Task_Check and GW_Docs.
- Keep existing path (f2→f3→GW_Docs) for on-time cases.

This guarantees the claim reaches Task_Triage within 48 hours. Optionally, mark the timeout path with an escalation code in the sequenceFlow documentation to indicate auto-escalation.
