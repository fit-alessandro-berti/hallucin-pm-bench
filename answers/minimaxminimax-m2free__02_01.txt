I need to answer these questions based strictly on the XES event log fragment. Let me carefully extract the information from the events provided. There are 10 event lines, deliberately shuffled. I must only use facts that can be read directly from this fragment.

Let me first parse through all the events and identify the case IDs, timestamps, and activities:

1. Event 1: case A-9321, "Receive_Order", timestamp 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00
2. Event 2: case A-9321, "Validate_Order", timestamp 2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00  
3. Event 3: case B-1045, "Receive_Order", timestamp 2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00
4. Event 4: case B-1045, "Validate_Order", timestamp 2025-04-14T08:17:00.000+00:00
5. Event 5: case A-9321, "Pack_Items", timestamp 2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00
6. Event 6: case B-1045, "Quality_Check", timestamp 2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00
7. Event 7: case B-1045, "Pack_Items", timestamp 2025-04-14T09:10:00.000+00:00
8. Event 8: case A-9321, "Ship_Order", timestamp 2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00
9. Event 9: case B-1045, "Ship_Order", timestamp 2025-04-14T09:25:00.000+00:00
10. Event 10: case C-77, "Quality_Check", timestamp 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00

Now let me answer each question:

Q1. How many distinct case IDs appear in the fragment?

Looking at the case IDs from all events:
- A-9321 (appears in events 1, 2, 5, 8)
- B-1045 (appears in events 3, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- C-77 (appears in event 10)

So there are 3 distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77.

Q2. Which activity immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case A-9321?

For case A-9321, looking at all events and their timestamps:
- Receive_Order at 08:02:00


- Validate_Order at 08:16:00
- Pack_Items at 09:01:00
- Ship_Order at 09:20:00

I'll analyze the sequence to determine the immediate predecessor of "Ship_Order". The events show a clear progression from Receive_Order through Validate_Order, then Pack_Items, and finally Ship_Order. The timestamp reveals that Pack_Items directly precedes Ship_Order at 09:20:00.

Q3. What is the earliest timestamp in the fragment?

Comparing all timestamps, the earliest is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00 from the Receive_Order event in case A-9321.

Q4. How many times does "Quality_Check" occur?

Examining the events, "Quality_Check" appears twice: in case B-1045 at 08:45:00 and in case C-77 at 10:00:00.

Q5. Identifying activities not starting any case requires checking each event's initial appearance.

Analyzing the first events for each case:
- A-9321 begins with Receive_Order
- B-1045 starts with Receive_Order  
- C-77 initiates with Quality_Check

Comparing activities:
- Receive_Order is not a first event
- Validate_Order is not a first event
- Pack_Items is not a first event
- Quality_Check is a first event for C-77
- Ship_Order is not a first event

The activities never appearing as first events are Receive_Order, Validate_Order, Pack_Items, and Ship_Order.
