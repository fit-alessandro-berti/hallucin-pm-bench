**No**

The claim is inaccurate because there are two cases where Validate_Payment occurs *before* Receive_Order rather than following it. In case C003 (lines 6-7), Validate_Payment happens at 10:43 and Receive_Order happens later at 10:45. Similarly, in case C005 (lines 11-12), Validate_Payment occurs at 12:00 before any Receive_Order activity is recorded for that case. While cases C001, C002, and C004 do show Validate_Payment following Receive_Order, the word "always" makes the claim false since at least two counterexamples exist in the log fragment.
