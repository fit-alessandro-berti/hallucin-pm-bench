Add a non-interrupting boundary event (timer) attached to **Task_Triage**. Configure the timer to trigger after **48 hours** from process start. When it expires, throw an **escalation event** to auto-escalate the claim. This ensures if the task hasn't started within 48 hours (measured from **Start_Claim**), the escalation fires immediately upon timer expiry. No new tasks are added.  

*Reference:* Attach boundary event to `Task_Triage` with timer duration `PT48H`.
