### 4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.

1. **Insufficient sample size**: With only 18 logged events, the sample size is too small to provide a reliable estimate of the overall frequency of manual fraud checks, especially if the activity is rare.
2. **Sampling bias**: The fragment might not represent the full range of cases or time periods, potentially excluding months with higher or lower frequencies of manual fraud checks, leading to an inaccurate estimate.
