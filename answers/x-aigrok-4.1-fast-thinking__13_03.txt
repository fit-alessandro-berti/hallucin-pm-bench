**2️⃣** This snippet spans only ~1.5 hours on March 1 (09:02–10:45 UTC), covering 3 cases (IDs 1001–1003, likely early in the month). It shows 1 “Manual Fraud Check” across 15 events/3 cases (~33% of cases). A full month-long log (31 days) likely has thousands of cases, so this tiny, temporally limited sample risks over- or underestimating frequency due to non-representative early-day/low-volume bias.
