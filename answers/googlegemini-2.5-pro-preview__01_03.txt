Okay, I am an expert on Acme Bank's SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process as defined.

Here are the answers based strictly on the provided process description:

**a) Summarise every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process, describing its rule in one sentence each.**

1.  **Conditional Skip of Manual Underwriting (Step 4):** Manual-Underwriting-Review (step 5) is skipped if the risk from Tri-Color-Risk-Check is Low or Medium AND the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less; otherwise, step 5 is performed.
2.  **Decision-Gate “TriVote” (Step 6):** The loan application passes this gate if it receives approvals from at least two out of the three designated officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer).

**b) List ALL documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear.**

1.  **Form 14B** (Step 1: Receive-Application)
2.  **Scorecard–Cyan** (Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
3.  **Scorecard–Magenta** (Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
4.  **Scorecard–Yellow** (Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
5.  **Deck Memo** (Step 5: Manual-Underwriting-Review)
6.  **Offer Sheet 77** (Step 7: Prepare-Binding-Offer)
7.  **ID Matrix Declaration** (Step 8: Request-Applicant-Confirmation)
8.  **Loan Dossier 2025** (Step 9: Finalize-Agreement)
