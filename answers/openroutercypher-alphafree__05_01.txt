Add a timer event to "Task_Triage" with a 48-hour limit. Connect "Start_Claim" directly to "Task_Triage" using a new sequence flow with a timer condition of 48 hours. This creates an auto-escalation path.

**Changes:**
1. Add timer event to "Task_Triage" for 48 hours.
2. Create new sequence flow from "Start_Claim" to "Task_Triage" with timer.

**Expected Outcome:**  
If claims arenâ€™t completed within 48 hours, the timer triggers "Task_Triage" bypassing the existing steps, ensuring SLA compliance.
