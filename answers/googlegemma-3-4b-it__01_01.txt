Okay, here’s a summary of the decision points within Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process, along with the required documents at each stage:

**1. Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**

*   **Decision Point:**  Determining if the refund request is eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.
*   **Required Documents:**
    *   *RefundRequestForm*
    *   *FlightManifest*
    *   *WeatherReport*

**2. High-value branch – Senior_Auditor_Review (Triggered if refund amount > €1,000)**

*   **Decision Point:**  Is the refund amount greater than €1,000?
*   **Required Documents:**
    *   *RefundRequestForm*
    *   *FlightManifest*
    *   *WeatherReport*
    *   *EligibilityChecklist* (used by Finance Controller)
    *   *AuditTrail* (required during Senior Auditor Review)



**Important Note:**  There are no other decision points within the defined Contoso Airlines flight-refund process. The process flows linearly after the initial triage step, with the high-value branch being the only conditional path.
