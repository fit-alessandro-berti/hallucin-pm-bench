Let me analyze the trace step by step against each rule in P2P-2025.R1.

Rule 1: Any purchase order (PO) whose total amount exceeds €10,000 must obtain two approvals, first by a Procurement Officer and then by the CFO, before activity Issue_PO.
- In the trace: Approve_PO by Procurement_Officer (#2) and then Approve_PO_CFO by CFO (#3) both occur before Issue_PO (#5).
- The PO amount is €12,300 > €10,000, so this requires both approvals.
- ✓ Compliant with Rule 1.

Rule 2: If the trace contains activity Expedite_Flag:
   • activity Quality_Check becomes optional
   • activity Risk_Assessment must occur before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods.
- The trace contains Expedite_Flag (#4).
- Quality_Check does not appear in the trace, which is allowed since it's optional with Expedite_Flag.
- Risk_Assessment occurs at #9, but Ship_Goods is at #8.
- ✗ Violation: Risk_Assessment must occur before the first Ship_Goods.

Rule 3: After Goods_Received, activity Three_way_match must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2).
- Goods_Received is at #6.
- The next two activities are #7 (Move_to_Quality) and #8 (Ship_Goods).
- Three_way_match doesn't occur until #10.
- ✗ Violation: Three_way_match occurs more than two activities after Goods_Received.

Rule 4: No activity executed by the role Intern may directly follow an activity executed by the role CFO.
- CFO's last activity is Approve_PO_CFO at #3.
- The next activity is Expedite_Flag by System, which is fine.
- The Intern's activity is at #7 (Move_to_Quality), which follows activity #6 by Warehouse_Clerk.
- ✓ No Intern activity directly follows CFO activity.

Rule 5: The trace must finish with Archive_Record and contain nothing after it.
- The last activity is Archive_Record (#11).
- ✓ Compliant with Rule 5.

Summary:
- Rule 1: Compliant
- Rule 2: Non-compliant (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods)
- Rule 3: Non-compliant (Three_way_match more than 2 activities after Goods_Received)
- Rule 4: Compliant
- Rule 5: Compliant

Therefore, the trace is Non-compliant due to violations of Rules 2 and 3.
Non-compliant

1. Violation of Rule 2: The trace contains Expedite_Flag at #4, requiring Risk_Assessment to occur before the first Ship_Goods. However, Risk_Assessment occurs at #9 while Ship_Goods occurs earlier at #8.

2. Violation of Rule 3: After Goods_Received (event #6), Three_way_match must occur within the next two activities, but it happens at #10 (Move_to_Quality > Ship_Goods > nothing > Three_way_match), which is more than two activities later. The distance between Goods_Received (#6) and Three_way_match (#10) is 4 positions, which exceeds the allowed distance of ≤2.

Although the trace complies with Rules 1, 4, and 5, the violations of Rules 2 and 3 make the entire trace non-compliant.
