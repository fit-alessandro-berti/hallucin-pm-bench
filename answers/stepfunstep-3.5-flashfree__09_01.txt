The requested average cycle time for the activity “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the provided event log. The log only includes case_id, activity, and resource fields, with timestamps and elapsed-time fields explicitly redacted. Cycle time calculations require start and end times or duration data for each activity instance, which are absent in this dataset.
