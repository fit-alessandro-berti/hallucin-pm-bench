**1. Answer: No**

**2. Justification:**

The FACT claims that **“Validate_Payment” always occurs immediately after “Receive_Order,” with no other activities in between**.

Let's examine the evidence:

- **Case C001:**  
  - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T09:12:00  
  - Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T09:15:00  
  - **Between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment:** No activities (Validate_Payment is immediate).

- **Case C002:**  
  - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T09:30:00  
  - Pack_Items at 2025-01-03T09:50:00  
  - Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T10:05:00  
  - **Between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment:** Pack_Items occurs (not immediate).

- **Case C003:**  
  - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T09:40:00  
  - Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T09:44:00  
  - **Between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment:** No activities (Validate_Payment is immediate).

- **Case C004:**  
  - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T10:05:00  
  - Check_Fraud at 2025-01-03T10:07:00  
  - Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T10:20:00  
  - **Between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment:** Check_Fraud occurs (not immediate).

**Conclusion:**  
There are cases (C002 and C004) where **Validate_Payment does NOT occur immediately after Receive_Order**; other activities intervene. Therefore, the FACT is **not accurate**.

---

**Final Answer:**  
**No** — The FACT is inaccurate because, for C002 and C004, other activities occur between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.
