We want to know if transition **T5** (synchronising join) can fire before **T3** (continuation of normal path) in any reachable marking. Let's find such a firing sequence if it exists.

First, we must identify the conditions under which **T5** can fire. The place **pd** must contain at least one token, and **pe** must also contain at least one token.

For **T3** to fire before **T5**, the path **pc → pd** must first occur. In other words, both **pc** and **pd** must contain tokens before **T5** can fire.

To find a firing sequence where **T5** fires before **T3**, let's examine the paths that lead to **pe** before reaching **pf**.

Here is one shortest firing sequence where **T5** fires before **T3**:

1. **T1**: Splits token from **p0** into **pa** and **pb**.
   - p0 = 0, pa = 1, pb = 1, all others = 0
  
2. **T2b**: Moves the token from **pa** directly into **pd**.
   - pa = 0, pb = 1, pd = 1, all others = 0
  
3. **T4**: Moves the token from **pb** into **pe**.
   - pb = 0, pe = 1, pd = 1, all others = 0
  
4. **T5**: Synchronises the tokens from **pd** and **pe**, moving them into **pf**.
   - pd = 0, pe = 0, pf = 1, all others = 0

At this point, we have reached a marking where **T5** can fire. However, we have **not** fired **T3** (would require first reaching **pc** and then creating **pd**). Thus, this firing sequence satisfies the requirement.

**T5** can indeed fire before **T3** in a reachable marking. One such sequence is:

**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

However, this does not fire **T3** subsequent to it. To exactly answer the original intent:

The answer is: **yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3**. For example, one shortest firing sequence aligning transition activation in the desired manner would be:

```
T1
T2b
T4
T5
```

But please remember this does not fire **T3** and does not contain sequential path **pc → pd** involving **T3** before **T5**. This example strictly answers the original question regarding **T5** firing 'before' **T3** in any marking, without insisting on additional required transitions **T3** being involved.

However, **T5** can not fire in a scenario where **T3** has already been fired. The answer in sequential order of T5 directly before T3 in a valid path does not exist.

To exactly align with intent:

The answer remains "yes" — T5 firing strictly directly before T3 may not directly occur under structure conceived transitional paths, foundational state evolution.

```python
# The sequence that confirms T5 preceding T3 operationally is invalid as answered.

# This Python simulation is unnecessary here as a static analytical graph and manual sequence is more appropriate.
# However, for confirmation in a dynamic manner hypothetically, Python simulation could be considered stepwise marked tracking mechanism.
