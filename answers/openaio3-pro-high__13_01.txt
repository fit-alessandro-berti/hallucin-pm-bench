1. Count of “Manual_Fraud_Check” events: 1

2. Percentage of all logged events: (1 ÷ 18) × 100 = 5.56 %

3. Case identifier(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”: A1002

4. Why a monthly estimate based on this fragment is unreliable (sampling issues):
   • Very small sample size (18 events / 4 cases): a single additional fraud-check would change the rate drastically, so the estimate has high sampling variance.  
   • Narrow time window: all events occur within a few hours on 1 May; the fragment is not a random or stratified sample of the whole month, so any day-of-week or intra-month patterns are missed (temporal sampling bias).
