**Answer:** No  

**Justification**

| CaseID | Ordered activities (by timestamp) | Does “Validate_Payment” follow “Receive_Order” directly? |
|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **C001** | Receive_Order → **Validate_Payment** → Pack_Items | **Yes** – no intervening activity |
| **C002** | Receive_Order → Pack_Items → **Validate_Payment** | **No** – *Pack_Items* occurs between the two |
| **C003** | Receive_Order → **Validate_Payment** → Ship_Order | **Yes** – no intervening activity |
| **C004** | Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → **Validate_Payment** → Pack_Items | **No** – *Check_Fraud* occurs between the two |

The statement *“Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between.”* is contradicted by **C002** and **C004**, where other activities (Pack_Items and Check_Fraud, respectively) intervene. Hence the FACT is **incorrect**.
