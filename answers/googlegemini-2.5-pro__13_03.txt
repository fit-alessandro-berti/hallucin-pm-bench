2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency because this excerpt is a small, potentially unrepresentative sample. It contains only three cases from a single day. In this data, "Manual Fraud Check" occurs in one of three cases (33%). This ratio is unlikely to hold true for the entire month's log, which could contain thousands of cases with different characteristics. Process behavior can vary significantly day-to-day or week-to-week. Relying on such a limited snapshot could lead to a significant overestimation or underestimation of the actual prevalence of this manual activity across the full dataset.
