T1 T2b T4 T5

## Explanation
To determine if T5 can fire before T3, identify a sequence where T5 becomes enabled without T3 firing. T5 requires tokens in pd and pe.

- Fire T1: Consumes token from p0, produces tokens in pa and pb. Marking: pa=1, pb=1.
- Fire T2b: Consumes token from pa, produces token in pd (bypassing pc and T3). Marking: pb=1, pd=1.
- Fire T4: Consumes token from pb, produces token in pe. Marking: pd=1, pe=1.
- At this point, T5 is enabled (tokens in pd and pe) and T3 has not fired (pc=0, so T3 is not enabled).

Thus, firing T5 next is possible before T3. This sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) is shortest, as T5 requires at least these four firings to enable without involving T3.
