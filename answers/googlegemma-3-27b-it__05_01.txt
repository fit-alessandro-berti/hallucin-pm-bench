To meet the 48-hour SLA without adding tasks, introduce a **Timer Intermediate Catch Event** after “Receive Claim” (Task_Receive). Configure this timer to fire after 48 hours. 

Connect a sequence flow from the timer event to “Task_Triage”, bypassing “Task_Check” and “GW_Docs”. This ensures claims automatically flow to triage if they aren’t processed within the timeframe. This assumes auto-escalation means direct routing for triage rather than a separate escalation process. The existing flow from “Task_Check” (f3 & f5/f6) remains for claims progressing normally.
