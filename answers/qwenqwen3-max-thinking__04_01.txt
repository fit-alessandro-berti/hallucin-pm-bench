Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains the activity `Expedite_Flag` (event 4). According to Rule 2, when `Expedite_Flag` is present, `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at event 9. This violates the requirement that `Risk_Assessment` must precede `Ship_Goods`.

2. **Rule 3 is satisfied**: `Goods_Received` occurs at event 6, and `Three_way_match` occurs at event 10. The distance between them is 3 activities (events 7, 8, 9), which exceeds the allowed maximum of 2. However, upon closer inspection, the rule states that `Three_way_match` must be completed **within the next two activities**, meaning it must appear at event 7 or 8. Since it appears at event 10, this is also a **Rule 3 violation**.

3. **Rule 4 is satisfied**: The only `CFO` activity is event 3 (`Approve_PO_CFO`). The next activity (event 4) is performed by `System`, not `Intern`, so Rule 4 is not violated.

4. **Rule 5 is satisfied**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event 11) and nothing follows it.

5. **Rule 1 is satisfied**: The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, and the trace shows both required approvals: `Approve_PO` by `Procurement_Officer` (event 2) and `Approve_PO_CFO` by `CFO` (event 3), both occurring before `Issue_PO` (event 5).

**However, due to violations of Rule 2 and Rule 3, the trace is Non-compliant.**
