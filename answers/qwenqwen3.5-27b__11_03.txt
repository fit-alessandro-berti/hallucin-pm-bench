Subject: Urgent Process Performance Review

Analysis identifies three activities impacting performance due to SLA breaches and high waiting times. Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment require focus.

Legal Approval exceeds its 600s target by 300s, recording the highest average waiting time of 600s. Risk Review breaches its 300s SLA by 300s, with cases waiting 480s on average. Credit Assessment surpasses its 240s target by 60s, contributing 200s of waiting time per case.

To mitigate these delays and align throughput with defined targets, I recommend the following actions:
* Allocate additional resources to Legal Approval to reduce the 600s average waiting time.
* Optimize Risk Review workflows to lower the 600s throughput time.
* Enhance data inputs for Credit Assessment to decrease the 200s waiting duration.

Addressing these metrics is essential for immediate process recovery.
