I cannot compute the average cycle time of “Approve Invoice” (nor its standard deviation or 95 % confidence interval) because the provided event log contains only column headers with all rows and timestamps redacted. Without any actual start_time and complete_time entries for “Approve Invoice,” there is no underlying sample from which to calculate durations or derive statistical measures.
