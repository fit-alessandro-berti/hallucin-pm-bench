**1.** The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.  

**2.** Percentage of all logged events:  
\[
\frac{1}{18}\times 100 = 5.56\%
\]  
(rounded to two decimal places).

**3.** Case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”: **A1002**.

**4.** Two sampling‑related reasons the monthly‑frequency estimate is unreliable:  

1. **Tiny and non‑representative sample** – the fragment covers only 18 events from a single day (May 1, 2025). Such a limited snapshot cannot capture the variability in manual fraud‑check occurrences that would appear over an entire month or across different days, leading to high sampling error.  

2. **Selection bias / incomplete coverage** – the fragment includes only cases that happened to be recorded in this dataset; many other cases (e.g., orders on other dates, weeks, or in other business units) are missing. Consequently, the observed frequency may be systematically over‑ or under‑estimated compared to the true monthly rate.
