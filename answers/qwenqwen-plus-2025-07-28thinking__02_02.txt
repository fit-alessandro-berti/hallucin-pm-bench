### Answers:

**Q1** How many **distinct cases** are present in this fragment?  
**Answer:** 3  
*(The distinct case IDs are C001, C002, and C003.)*

---

**Q2** For case **“C002”**, list the **sequence of activities** in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).  
**Answer:**  
`Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`  
*(Ordered by timestamps: Receive_Order (09:15:10) → Check_Stock (09:22:55) → Arrange_Delivery (10:15:20) → Ship_Order (10:25:40).)*

**Q3** Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).  
**Answer:**  
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```  
*(Rationale: For C002, Ship_Order is preceded by Arrange_Delivery; for C001 and C003, Ship_Order is preceded by Check_Stock. Alphabetical order places "Arrange_Delivery" before "Check_Stock".)*
