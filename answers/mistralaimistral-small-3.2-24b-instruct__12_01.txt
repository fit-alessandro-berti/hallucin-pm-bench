The fact is **inaccurate** based on the event-log fragment. Hereâ€™s the justification:

- **Case 1001**: "Authorize_Refund" occurs **after** "Update_Inventory" (violating the claim).
- **Case 1002**: "Authorize_Refund" occurs **before** "Refund_Issued" (no "Update_Inventory" in this case, so irrelevant to the claim).
- **Case 1003**: "Authorize_Refund" occurs **after** "Update_Inventory" (violating the claim).

The claim is false because in **Cases 1001 and 1003**, "Authorize_Refund" follows "Update_Inventory," not the other way around.
