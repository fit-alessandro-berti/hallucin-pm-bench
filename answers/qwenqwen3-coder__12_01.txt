No, the fact is **not accurate**.

### Justification:
The claim states that **“Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately *before* “Update_Inventory”** within the same case.

However, in the provided event-log fragment:

- In **Case 1001**, **“Update_Inventory”** occurs **before** **“Authorize_Refund”**.
  - Sequence:
    - `08:25:55`: **Update_Inventory**
    - `08:30:02`: **Authorize_Refund**

- In **Case 1003**, **“Update_Inventory”** also occurs **before** **“Authorize_Refund”**.
  - Sequence:
    - `10:08:07`: **Update_Inventory**
    - `10:22:18`: **Authorize_Refund**

Thus, in both cases where both activities occur, **“Update_Inventory” precedes “Authorize_Refund”**, which contradicts the claim that **“Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory”**.

### Conclusion:
The data **do not support** the given claim. In fact, they show the **opposite** sequence for the relevant cases (1001 and 1003). Case 1002 does not contain the “Update_Inventory” activity at all, so it cannot be used to support or refute the claim.
