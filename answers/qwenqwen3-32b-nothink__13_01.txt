#### **4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**

1. **Small sample size**: The event log only contains 18 events from a single day, which is insufficient to represent a full month of activity.
2. **Temporal bias**: The data are from one day (May 1, 2025), and there is no indication that this day has typical activity levels or patterns that reflect the entire month.

✅ **Answer:**
1. The data represent a very small subset of total cases and events, making the estimate sensitive to sampling bias.
2. The data are collected over a single day, which may not be representative of monthly variations in fraud check frequency.
