1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in the excerpt.

2️⃣ This snippet contains only three cases (1001–1003). One case uses “Manual Fraud Check,” while two use automatic variants (“Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)”). Because the sample is extremely small and may not be representative, an analyst cannot infer the true frequency of manual checks across the full month. Additionally, naming inconsistencies (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) may obscure pattern recognition, and rare or batched manual reviews might be under- or over-represented in this limited window.
