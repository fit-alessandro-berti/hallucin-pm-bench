Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to parse through the given XES event log fragment and extract the necessary information. The log has 10 events, each with a case identifier, concept name (activity), and timestamp. The lines are out of order, so I'll need to use the timestamps to determine the chronological order if needed.

**Question 1: How many distinct cases are present?**

To find the number of distinct cases, I need to look at the `case` attribute in each event and count the unique values. Let's list them out:

- C456 appears in events 1, 4, 7, 9.
- C123 appears in events 2, 5, 6, 10.
- C789 appears in events 3, 8.

So, the unique cases are C456, C123, and C789. That's 3 distinct cases.

**Question 2: For case “C456”, which activity immediately precedes “Ship_Order”?**

First, identify all events related to case C456:

1. Validate_Order at 09:20:00
4. Ship_Order at 09:40:00
7. Pack_Items at 09:35:00
9. Create_Order at 09:10:00

Now, sort these by timestamp to find the order:

- Create_Order (09:10:00)
- Validate_Order (09:20:00)
- Pack_Items (09:35:00)
- Ship_Order (09:40:00)

The activity immediately before Ship_Order is Pack_Items.

**Question 3: Which activity appears exactly once in the entire fragment?**

Let's list all activities and their counts:

- Create_Order: 3 times (C123, C456, C789)
- Validate_Order: 2 times (C123, C456)
- Pack_Items: 2 times (C123, C456)
- Ship_Order: 2 times (C123, C456)
- Cancel_Order: 1 time (C789)

So, Cancel_Order appears exactly once.

Now, summarizing the answers:

1. **3**
2. **Pack_Items**
3. **Cancel_Order**
• 3 distinct cases present: C456, C123, and C789
• For case "C456", Pack_Items immediately precedes Ship_Order
• Cancel_Order appears exactly once in the entire fragment
