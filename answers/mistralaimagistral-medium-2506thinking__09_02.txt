**Summary and Answer:**

The calculation of the average cycle time for the activity “Dual Authorization” requires knowing the time difference between its start and completion for each instance. The provided frequency table only includes counts of occurrences for each activity and lifecycle stage but does not contain any timestamp information. Since cycle time is inherently dependent on the temporal data, and none was provided in the "information above," it is impossible to determine the average cycle time based solely on the given data.

Therefore, the answer is:

The average cycle time cannot be determined because no timestamp data was provided.

\boxed{\text{The average cycle time cannot be determined because no timestamp data was provided.}}
