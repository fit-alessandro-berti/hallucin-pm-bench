The requested metrics cannot be computed. Artefact A, the event-log stub, has had all data rows and timestamp values redacted for privacy. To calculate the cycle time for the activity "Approve Invoice," the `start_time` and `complete_time` for each instance of this activity are required. Since these values are missing, it is impossible to derive the average, standard deviation, or any confidence interval from the supplied log. Artefact B is also not suitable as it provides a historical average for a different metric (the time between two distinct activities), not the cycle time of the single activity in question.
