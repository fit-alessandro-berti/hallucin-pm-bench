**Question 1:**
Yes, transition T5 can fire before T3 in certain reachable markings. For instance, after firing T1 and T7, tokens are distributed such that T5 (with {P2, P5}) and T3 (with {P2}) have overlapping preconditions. A subsequent firing of T3 enables T5.

**Question 2 (bonus):**
A minimal firing sequence demonstrating this is [T1, T7, T3, T4, T5]. Initially, T1 splits tokens to P1 and P2. Firing T7 leads to {P3, P4}. T3 consumes {P2}, while T4 propagates {P4}. Firing T5 with {P2, P5} completes the sequence. This demonstrates the non-deterministic nature of AND-split and synchronizing join constructs in Petri nets.
