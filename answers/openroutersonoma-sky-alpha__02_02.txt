Q1 3  
Q2 Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
Q3 Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock  

## Explanation

The reasoning process involves parsing the provided XES event log fragment to extract and analyze case and activity information systematically.

For Q1, the distinct cases are identified by examining the case attribute in each of the 10 events. The cases present are C001 (events 1, 3, 7), C002 (events 2, 5, 8, 10), and C003 (events 4, 6, 9), resulting in three unique cases.

For Q2, the events for case C002 are filtered from the log: event 2 (Receive_Order), event 5 (Check_Stock), event 8 (Arrange_Delivery), and event 10 (Ship_Order). These are ordered chronologically by timestamp, yielding the sequence Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order.

For Q3, the Ship_Order events are located (events 7 for C001, 9 for C003, and 10 for C002). For each, the immediately preceding event in the same case is determined: for C001, it is Check_Stock (event 3); for C003, it is Check_Stock (event 6); for C002, it is Arrange_Delivery (event 8). The distinct preceding activities are Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock, which are then sorted alphabetically to list as Arrange_Delivery followed by Check_Stock.
