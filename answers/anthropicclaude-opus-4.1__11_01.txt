**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Chief Operating Officer  
**FROM:** Senior Process Mining Analyst  
**RE:** Critical Waiting Time Bottlenecks - Immediate Action Required

**Three Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time:**

**#1. Request_Documents**  
- Average wait: 36.5 hours | 95th percentile: 120.0 hours  
- **Action:** Implement automated document request system with pre-filled templates and direct customer portal uploads, eliminating manual processing delays.

**#2. Send_Closure_Letter**  
- Average wait: 12.2 hours | 95th percentile: 44.0 hours  
- **Action:** Deploy auto-generation for standard closure letters triggered immediately upon claim resolution, requiring human review only for complex cases.

**#3. Assess_Liability**  
- Average wait: 7.8 hours | 95th percentile: 16.4 hours  
- **Action:** Create specialized fast-track queue for straightforward liability assessments (single-party, clear documentation), routing only complex multi-party cases to senior adjusters.

These targeted interventions should reduce waiting times by 20-40% within 90 days of implementation.
