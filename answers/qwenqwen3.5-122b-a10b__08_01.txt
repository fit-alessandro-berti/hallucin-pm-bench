**Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

**Concrete Firing Sequence:**
$$ \langle T_1, T_2, T_5 \rangle $$

**Justification:**
1.  **Initial Marking ($M_0$):** Only $p_0$ contains a token.
2.  **Fire $T_1$:** Consumes $p_0$, produces tokens in $p_1$ and $p_2$. (Marking: $p_1=1, p_2=1$).
3.  **Fire $T_2$:** Consumes $p_1$, produces a token in $p_3$. (Marking: $p_3=1, p_2=1$).
4.  **Enable $T_5$:** Transition $T_5$ requires a token in $p_3$ (present) and an **inhibitor** check on $p_4$ (must be 0). Since $T_3$ has not fired yet, $p_4$ remains empty ($0$ tokens). Thus, $T_5$ is enabled.
5.  **Fire $T_5$:** $T_5$ fires. At this point in the sequence, $T_3$ has not fired.

Therefore, a valid execution path exists where $T_5$ fires while $T_3$ has not yet occurred.
