**To:** COO, Acme Insurance
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Date:** Q1 2025 Performance Brief
**Subject:** Critical Bottlenecks in Claims Handling

The three worst-performing activities are:

1.  **Request_Documents:** This is the primary bottleneck, with an extreme 150-minute average wait time. The 22% rework rate indicates frequent errors or omissions, causing cases to loop back and clog the queue.
    *   **Action:** Implement a standardized checklist for assessors to ensure document requests are complete and accurate the first time, targeting the high rework rate.

2.  **Review_Documents:** This activity has the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and significant processing time variability (stdev=9). The 5.3% rework rate suggests quality issues.
    *   **Action:** Provide additional training on complex document cases to reduce variability and rework, thereby decreasing SLA breaches.

3.  **Initial_Assessment:** This stage has a high wait time (18 min) and the second-highest SLA breach rate (3.2%), creating an early bottleneck.
    *   **Action:** Re-allocate resources to this front-line activity to reduce the queue and prevent delays from propagating through the process.
