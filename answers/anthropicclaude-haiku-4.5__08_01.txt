# Analysis: Can T5 fire before T3?

## Answer: **NO**, it is impossible.

## Proof:

**Initial marking:** p0=1, all others=0

**Necessary preconditions:**
- For T5 to fire, we need: p3≥1 AND p4=0 (due to the inhibitor arc)
- For T3 to fire, we need: p2≥1

**Key observation:**
- The *only* way to place a token in p3 is via **T2**, which requires p1≥1
- The *only* way to place a token in p2 is via **T1**
- **T1 is the only transition that can fire initially** (it requires p0=1)

**Firing sequence analysis:**

1. **T1 must fire first** (it's the only enabled transition)
   - After T1: p1=1, p2=1, p0=0

2. **To enable T5**, we need p3≥1 and p4=0
   - To get a token in p3, we must fire **T2** (requires p1≥1) ✓
   - After T2: p1=0, p3=1, p2=1
   - **T4 is now enabled** (requires p3=1 and p4=0)

3. **But T3 is also enabled** (requires p2=1)

4. **If T3 fires before T4:**
   - After T3: p4=1
   - Now p4=1, so **T5 becomes disabled** (inhibitor arc blocks it)
   - T4 can then fire, consuming both p3 and p4

5. **If T4 fires instead of T3:**
   - After T4: p3=0, p4=0, p5=1
   - Now p3=0, so **T5 becomes disabled** (requires p3≥1)

**Conclusion:** Once we reach a marking with p3≥1 (necessary for T5), we cannot avoid either firing T3 (which blocks T5 via the inhibitor) or firing T4 (which removes the token from p3). Therefore, **T5 can never fire before T3**.
