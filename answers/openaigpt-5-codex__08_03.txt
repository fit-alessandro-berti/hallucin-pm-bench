**Yes.**  
A shortest firing sequence that lets **T5** occur before any firing of **T3** is:

`T1 → T2b → T4 → T5`

Step-by-step markings (tokens shown as counts):

1. Start: `p0=1`
2. After **T1**: `pa=1, pb=1`
3. After **T2b**: `pd=1, pb=1`
4. After **T4**: `pd=1, pe=1`
5. Now **T5** is enabled (pd & pe present) and fires, without any occurrence of **T3**.

This sequence is shortest because:
- **T1** must fire to produce `pa` and `pb`.
- **T5** needs tokens in both `pd` and `pe`.
- The only way to get `pe` is **T4** (from `pb`).
- The only way to obtain `pd` without using **T3** is via the shortcut **T2b** (from `pa`).

Thus **T5** can indeed fire before **T3**, and the sequence above achieves it in the minimum number of steps.
