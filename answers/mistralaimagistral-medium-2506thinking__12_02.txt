The stated fact is **No**.

The justification is that there are two instances of "Validate_Payment" that violate the stated fact.

1. For case **C003**, "Validate_Payment" occurs at line 6 (10:43:00) before "Receive_Order" at line 7 (10:45:00), violating the claim that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order.

2. For case **C005**, "Validate_Payment" occurs at line 11 without any preceding "Receive_Order", further disproving the fact.

So, if the fact stated is always true, then it should hold for all instances.
But since we have counter-examples on both C003 and C005, the fact claim of ordering is invalidated.

\boxed{No}
