**Answer 1:** Yes.  
**Answer 2:** A minimal sequence is T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5. After T1 fires, T2 and T7 can proceed, filling P3 and P4. T4 then moves a token to P5. At this point, P2 (from T1) and P5 (from T4) are both marked, allowing T5 to fire before T3. T3 requires P2, but T5 only needs P2 to still have a token, which it does until T3 fires. Thus, T5 can fire before T3.
