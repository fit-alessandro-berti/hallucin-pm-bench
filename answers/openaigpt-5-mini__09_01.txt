I cannot compute that average from the provided log. The snippet shows only case_id, activity and resource — the timestamps/elapsed-time fields needed to calculate activity durations have been redacted. 

To compute the average cycle time you would need, for each occurrence of “Review Contract”, either
- the elapsed time for that activity, or
- start and end timestamps to derive the elapsed time.

Then average those elapsed times (sum of Review Contract durations ÷ number of Review Contract occurrences).
