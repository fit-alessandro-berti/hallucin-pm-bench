# Answer

**Question 1:** No, it is not possible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

**Question 2:** 

T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5 to fire. P5 can only receive a token from T4, which requires a token in P4. P4 can receive tokens from either T7 or T3.

However, T3 consumes the token from P2. Since T5 *also* requires the token in P2, if T3 hasn't fired yet, we still have the P2 token available. But to get a token in P5 (needed for T5), we must fire T4, which needs a token in P4 first.

The only way to get a token into P4 without firing T3 is via T7 (through P1→P3→P4), but this path still leaves P2 occupied, and T5 would then require T3 to have already fired—a contradiction.

Therefore, T3 must fire before T5.
