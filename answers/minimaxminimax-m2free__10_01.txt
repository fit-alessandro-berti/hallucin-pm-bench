The user is requesting a RACI matrix for the order-to-cash workflow described. They also have specific vocabulary policies:

- Must say “KYC Review” — never “Customer Due Diligence”.
- Must say “Order Vetting” — never “Order Validation”.
- Must say “Payment Clearance” — never “Payment Processing”.
Use those exact spellings and capitalisation; do not mention the forbidden terms, even in brackets or quotes.

Thus we need to adapt the process steps accordingly.

The original process:

1. Receive Application — handled by the Account Manager.

2. Customer Due Diligence — performed by the Compliance Officer once documents arrive.

3. Order Validation — the Account Manager checks data completeness.

4. Payment Processing — the Finance Clerk initiates settlement.

5. Record Update — IT Support refreshes the CRM.

6. Notify Customer — the Account Manager emails confirmation.

We need to map to R, A, C, I.

Definition: R = Responsible (does the work), A = Accountable (ultimately answerable, only one per activity), C = Consulted (provides input), I = Informed (kept updated). Typically each activity will have one A, maybe multiple R, C, I.

The roles:

- Account Manager (AM)
- Compliance Officer (CO)
- Finance Clerk (FC)
- IT Support (IT)

We must adhere to terminology: Use "KYC Review" for the "Customer Due Diligence" step. Use "Order Vetting" for "Order Validation". Use "Payment Clearance" for "Payment Processing". The step names should be updated accordingly in the RACI matrix.

Thus final matrix rows should be:

1. Receive Application

2. KYC Review (formerly Customer Due Diligence)

3. Order Vetting (formerly Order Validation)

4. Payment Clearance (formerly Payment Processing)

5. Record Update

6. Notify Customer

Columns: AM, CO, FC, IT.

We need to assign A, R, C, I for each activity.

We'll have to decide for each activity which role is Accountable. The initial description suggests that the Account Manager is handling "Receive Application" and "Order Vetting" and "Notify Customer". The Compliance Officer is responsible for "KYC Review". The Finance Clerk is responsible for "Payment Clearance". IT Support is responsible for "Record Update". We can assign that as A (Accountable) for each respective role. Usually the role performing the activity is the Accountable one.

Alternatively, the "RACI" could treat "Responsible" as the role doing the activity (maybe also the Accountable). Many RACI matrices have the same role for R and A, but sometimes there can be separation. The typical approach: If one role is leading the activity, they are both R and A. But a better practice is that the same role is both R and A for that activity unless you want to separate.

Thus:

- Receive Application: AM does it; AM is R and A. Others may be C? Possibly CO does KYC after receiving? Or are they just consulted? Usually not. They may be informed about new application. So we could mark CO, FC, IT as I (informed) maybe C.

- KYC Review: CO performs KYC; CO is R and A. AM may be consulted for any clarifications; FC and IT may be informed after completed. So set R/A = CO; C = AM; I = FC, IT.

- Order Vetting: AM does data completeness check; AM is R and A. CO might be consulted if something off? Or not needed. FC and IT might be informed. So we can set R/A = AM; C = CO; I = FC, IT.

- Payment Clearance: FC initiates settlement; FC is R and A. AM may be consulted or informed. CO and IT may be informed. So set R/A = FC; C = AM; I = CO, IT.

- Record Update: IT updates CRM; IT is R and A. AM may be consulted or maybe informed. CO and FC may be informed. So set R/A = IT; C = AM; I = CO, FC.

- Notify Customer: AM emails confirmation; AM is R and A. Others may be informed (CO, FC, IT). Possibly consulted? Not needed. So set R/A = AM; I = CO, FC, IT.

We can reflect this in a RACI matrix: rows are activities; columns are roles (AM, CO, FC, IT). In each cell we can put R, A, C, I appropriately.

We need to ensure we follow the vocabulary guidelines.

The user didn't ask for anything else; just produce the RACI matrix. So we need to output a table.

We need to be mindful not to mention the forbidden terms (i.e., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") anywhere, even in brackets.

Thus we need to not even reference "formerly". That is not required. But we can describe each row as e.g., "KYC Review". But we must not include mention "Customer Due Diligence".

Alright.

Now produce the matrix:

We'll have the following:

| Activity | AM | CO | FC | IT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Receive Application | R, A (or A, R?) Actually we need to show both R and A. In a typical RACI matrix, a cell can show both "A,R". We'll decide how to display. Probably we can show "A/R". Many templates use "A/R". But may be more clear to separate: A for Accountable, R for Responsible. So a cell can have "A, R". We'll decide later.

Better to use a format: "A/R" for same role. Or list multiple roles with letters. Or we can use "A/R" or "A, R". I'll decide to use "A/R".

Thus:

- Receive Application: AM = A/R; CO = I; FC = I; IT = I.

- KYC Review: CO = A/R; AM = C; FC = I; IT = I.

- Order Vetting: AM = A/R; CO = C; FC = I; IT = I.

- Payment Clearance: FC = A/R; AM = C; CO = I; IT = I.

- Record Update: IT = A/R; AM = C; CO = I; FC = I.

- Notify Customer: AM = A/R; CO = I; FC = I; IT = I.

Alternatively, you might mark CO as "C" (consulted) for Order Vetting if needed.

We also need to check if any role besides the primary is consulted for some steps. For "KYC Review" we have CO as primary (A/R). AM may need to provide any missing info; we set them as consulted.

We also might consider "Notify Customer" where perhaps FC or CO might be consulted for specific instructions. But likely not needed. We'll keep I.

Now provide the final answer as a table.

Now we need to ensure that we use the exact phrase "KYC Review" with capitalization; "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance". Ensure no hidden references to the forbidden terms.

Thus we produce:

```
Activity          | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT)
------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------
Receive Application | A/R                  | I                       | I                  | I
KYC Review          | C                    | A/R                     | I                  | I
Order Vetting       | A/R                  | C                       | I                  | I
Payment Clearance   | C                    | I                       | A/R                | I
Record Update       | C                    | I                       | I                  | A/R
Notify Customer     | A/R                  | I                       | I                  | I
```

Or we can add descriptions.

We should also include legend explaining A, R, C, I.

Thus final answer: a table plus legend.

Make sure to maintain strict adherence: we used "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance". No other terms. Fine.

Let's also check that we didn't mention "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing". We didn't. So we are fine.

Now provide answer.

**Legend**  

- **A** – Accountable (ultimately answerable for the activity; only one role per activity)  
- **R** – Responsible (does the work to complete the activity)  
- **C** – Consulted (provides input before the activity is finalised)  
- **I** – Informed (kept up‑to‑date on progress/outcomes)  

*Note: The terminology used follows FinCo’s preferred wording – “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” are used in place of legacy terms.*
