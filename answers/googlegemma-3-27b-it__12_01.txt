No, the fact is not accurate.

While “Authorize_Refund” does occur before “Update_Inventory” in case 1001 and 1003, it does *not* occur *immediately* before it in those cases. There are intervening activities ("Inspect_Item" in 1001 and "Inspect_Item" and "Quality_Check" in 1003). Furthermore, in case 1002, “Authorize_Refund” is followed by “Refund_Issued”, not “Update_Inventory”. 

Therefore, the claim that “Authorize_Refund” *always* occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory” is false based on the provided event log.
