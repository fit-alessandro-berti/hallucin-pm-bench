# Analysis of Process Event Log

## Question 1: Frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check"
Exactly 1 time. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears only once in the log fragment, specifically for case A1002 on 2025-05-01T10:50:00.

## Question 2: Percentage of All Events
5.56%

Calculation:
- Total number of events in log: 18
- Number of "Manual_Fraud_Check" events: 1
- Percentage: (1/18) Ã— 100 = 5.56%

## Question 3: Case Identifier(s) with Manual Fraud Check
A1002

## Question 4: Why Monthly Estimate Would Be Unreliable
Two sampling-related reasons:

1. **Limited time coverage**: The fragment only contains data from a single day (2025-05-01) spanning approximately 5 hours, which is insufficient to represent an entire month's patterns.

2. **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 4 cases and 18 events total, which is too small to provide a statistically reliable estimate of monthly frequencies. The observed rate of 25% of cases (1 out of 4) requiring manual fraud checks may not be representative of the true monthly rate.
