Here are the decision points in Contoso’s flight-refund process and the documents they rely on:

- **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
  • Decision: Does the claim align with the FlightManifest and is it justified by the WeatherReport?  
  • Documents: RefundRequestForm (submitted by the customer), FlightManifest, WeatherReport.

- **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
  • Decision: Sign-off on the claim based on the EligibilityChecklist.  
  • Documents: EligibilityChecklist (applied to the validated claim and its supporting details).

- **High-value branch check**  
  • Decision: Is the refund amount greater than €1 000? If yes, route to Senior_Auditor_Review.  
  • Documents: Claim details with the refund amount; high-value cases then require an AuditTrail for review.

- **Senior_Auditor_Review** (only for claims > €1 000)  
  • Decision: Review and clear high-value cases.  
  • Documents: AuditTrail (along with prior approvals).

For completeness, the required artefacts across the process are:
- RefundRequestForm
- FlightManifest
- WeatherReport
- EligibilityChecklist
- AuditTrail (for high-value claims)
- BankTransferAuthorization (must be signed before Process_Refund_Payment)
- RefundConfirmationPDF (issued at the end with the confirmation letter)
