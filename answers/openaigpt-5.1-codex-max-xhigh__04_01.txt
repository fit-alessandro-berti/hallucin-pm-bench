Non-compliant  
1. Because `Expedite_Flag` is present, Rule 2 requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur before the first `Ship_Goods`, but here `Ship_Goods` is at step 8 and `Risk_Assessment` only at step 9, so the sequencing requirement is violated.  
2. After `Goods_Received` at step 6, Rule 3 mandates that `Three_way_match` be completed within the next two activities; it occurs at step 10, beyond the allowed distance, so this rule is not satisfied.
