I’m unable to compute the average cycle time, its standard deviation, or a 95 % confidence interval for the “Approve Invoice” activity.

The event‑log data that would provide the necessary start and completion timestamps for each instance of this activity have been removed. Without the actual timestamp values (and the corresponding case identifiers to link them), the cycle‑time calculation cannot be performed, and consequently neither the variability nor the confidence interval can be derived.
