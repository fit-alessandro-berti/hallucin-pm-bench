1. Count  
   Manual_Fraud_Check appears 1 time.

2. Percentages  
   a) Events: 1 / 48 = 2.08 %  
   b) Cases: 1 / 12 = 8.33 %

3. Because Manual_Fraud_Check occurs in only one event and one case, models trained on this slice treat it as noise: performance metrics (e.g., average throughput time from Fraud‐Check to payout) will be dominated by Auto_Fraud_Check yet reported as if generally valid. Predictive algorithms may over-fit, learning spurious rules (“Manual_Fraud_Check ⇒ instant approval”) that hardly ever happen in reality, yielding unreliable forecasts and misleading improvement priorities once the full population—where the activity is still rarer or absent—is analysed.
