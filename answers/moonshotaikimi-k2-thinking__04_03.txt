**No**  

- **Rule 1** – Satisfied: `Quality_Engineer_Review` (position 3) occurs once and before the single `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (position 5).  
- **Rule 2** – Satisfied: Severity is “High” and `VP_Safety_Approval` (position 6) occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3** – **Violated**: `Notify_Authorities` (position 4) is executed before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (position 5); NA must not occur until *both* QE and RA are complete.  
- **Rule 4** – Satisfied: `Close_Case` (position 7) occurs after NA and, as required by Rule 2, after VP.  

Because Rule 3 is violated, the trace is non‑compliant.
