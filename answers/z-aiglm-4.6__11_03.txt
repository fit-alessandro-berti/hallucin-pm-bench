Subject: Analysis of SLA Performance and Bottlenecks

This memo identifies the three activities with the most severe performance issues, based on SLA breaches and excessive waiting times. Our analysis highlights critical bottlenecks in Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment. Risk Review and Legal Approval both exceed their SLAs by 300 seconds, while Credit Assessment exceeds its target by 60 seconds. These activities also exhibit the longest average waiting times, with Legal Approval at 600s, Risk Review at 480s, and Credit Assessment at 200s, indicating significant resource contention.

*   Allocate additional resources to the Legal Approval queue to directly reduce the 600-second average waiting time.
*   Investigate resourcing for the Risk Review stage to mitigate the 480-second average waiting time, which constitutes 80% of its total throughput.
*   Implement process improvements within the Credit Assessment queue to lower the 200-second average wait.
