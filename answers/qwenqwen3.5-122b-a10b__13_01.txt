2. **5.56%**
   *(Calculation: 1 occurrence ÷ 18 total events = 0.0555... ≈ 5.56%)*

3. **A1002**

4. **Two sampling-related reasons:**
   *   **Insufficient Temporal Coverage:** The log fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01). Estimating monthly frequency requires data spanning the entire month to account for daily or weekly variations (e.g., weekends, month-end rushes).
   *   **Small Sample Size:** The dataset contains only 4 cases and 18 events. Such a small sample size leads to high statistical variance, making it unreliable to extrapolate a frequency rate for a full month.
