**Executive Memo: Claims Handling Process Performance – Q1 2025**

Our Q1 2025 dashboard highlights significant performance gaps in Acme Insurance’s Claims Handling process. Based on throughput, wait times, and SLA breaches, the three weakest activities are:

1. **Request Documents (avg_wait 150 min, rework 22%)**  
   This step’s extremely long queueing time and high rework indicate bottlenecks in data collection or stakeholder handoffs. Recommendation: Implement automated document collection workflows to reduce manual delays and errors.

2. **Check Coverage (avg_wait 4 min, but 12.4% SLA breach)**  
   While the queue is short, processing frequently exceeds the SLA, suggesting inconsistent review times. Recommendation: Standardize review checklists and provide targeted training to ensure consistent processing durations.

3. **Register Claim (avg_wait 2 min but high variability: stdev 1 min)**  
   Although wait times are low, the large processing-time variation implies inconsistent staff handling, risking predictability and SLAs. Recommendation: Conduct time-motion studies to identify training gaps and introduce performance monitoring dashboards for real-time tracking.

These targeted interventions—automation, standardized procedures, and performance tracking—should reduce delays and rework across the process.
