Add a **non-interrupting timer boundary event** to **Task_RequestDocs** that fires at “48h after Start_Claim” (or “48h since process start”). When it fires, route it **directly to Task_Triage** (reuse existing target) so the claim reaches triage even if documents are still missing; the adjuster can handle gaps during triage. Concretely: attach timer boundary event to **Task_RequestDocs**, add a new sequenceFlow from that timer to **Task_Triage**, and (optionally) mark it as escalation via an escalation event definition. No new tasks are introduced; only an event and flow are added.
