### Decision Points in Contoso’s Refund Process
Based on the defined process, the following are the key decision points, summarized by activity and outcome implications. These are derived from where evaluations, validations, or branches occur, leading to continuation (e.g., approval) or potential halting (e.g., rejection). Note: The process does not explicitly define rejection paths, but these points inherently involve decisions that could approve or deny progression.

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: The triage agent decides whether the claim is eligible by cross-referencing it with the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*. If validated, the process proceeds to pre-approval; otherwise, it halts without explicit rejection documentation.

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: The finance controller decides whether to sign off on the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*. A successful sign-off allows progression (to high-value branch or direct payment processing); failure halts the process.

3. **High-Value Branch (Refund Amount Check)**: After **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**, if the refund amount is greater than €1 000, the process branches to proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review**. If not, it skips the auditors and advances directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**. This numerical threshold serves as the decision criterion.

4. **Senior_Auditor_Review** (High-Value Cases Only): The senior auditor reviews the case, including the *AuditTrail*, and decides whether to approve it. Approval enables progression to **Process_Refund_Payment**; otherwise, the high-value claim is rejected and halts.

5. **Process_Refund_Payment**: The finance team decides whether to execute payment, contingent on the presence of a signed *BankTransferAuthorization* and satisfaction of prior preconditions (e.g., pre-approval and, if applicable, auditor review). Absence of the authorization or unsatisfied preconditions halts payment.
