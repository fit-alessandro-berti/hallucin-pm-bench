No.

The stated fact is inaccurate because in case C003 (lines 6 and 7), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 10:43:00Z (line 6) and *Receive_Order* follows at 10:45:00Z (line 7), meaning Validate_Payment **precedes** Receive_Order in this case. This violates the claim that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order. Other cases such as C001, C002, and C004 do follow the sequence, but the existence of even one counterexample (C003) disproves the universal assertion.
