No.  
The fact is inaccurate because in case C003, *Validate_Payment* (line 6) occurs **before** *Receive_Order* (line 7), violating the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order*. Additionally, case C005 (lines 11-12) lacks a prior *Receive_Order* entirely, as it proceeds directly to *Validate_Payment* and *Cancel_Order*. For case C001 (lines 1-2) and C002 (lines 3-5), the sequence holds, but these exceptions in C003 and C005 disprove the universality of the claim.
