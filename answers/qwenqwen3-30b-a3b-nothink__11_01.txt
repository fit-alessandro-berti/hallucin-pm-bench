**Memo: Process Performance Analysis – Waiting-Time Focus**  
**To:** COO  
**From:** Senior Process-Mining Analyst  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  

The three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:  

1. **Request_Documents** – Avg: 36.5h, 95p: 120.0h  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter** – Avg: 12.2h, 95p: 44.0h  
3. **Assess_Liability** – Avg: 7.8h, 95p: 16.4h  

**Recommendations:**  
- For **Request_Documents**, automate document requests to reduce manual delays.  
- For **Send_Closure_Letter**, implement a centralized workflow to streamline delivery.  
- For **Assess_Liability**, expand staffing during peak periods to reduce backlogs.  

These actions target the root causes of long waits and could cut waiting times by ≥20%.
