Non-compliant
1. The trace contains the `Expedite_Flag` activity, which makes `Quality_Check` optional but requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, in the trace, `Ship_Goods` (activity #8) occurs before `Risk_Assessment` (activity #9), violating rule 2 of the process rule set **P2P-2025.R1**.
2. Additionally, after `Goods_Received` (activity #6), `Three_way_match` (activity #10) does not occur within the next two activities as required by rule 3, because it is preceded by `Move_to_Quality` (activity #7) and `Ship_Goods` (activity #8), making the distance greater than 2.
3. Also, an activity executed by the role `Intern` (activity #7) directly follows an activity executed by the system, but more critically, the trace does not explicitly show an activity by the `CFO` directly followed by an activity by an `Intern`. However, these observations are not relevant to the non-compliance already identified. 
4. The trace does finish with `Archive_Record` and contains nothing after it, which complies with rule 5.
