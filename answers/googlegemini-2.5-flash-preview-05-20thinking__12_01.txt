The fact is inaccurate.

In Case 1001, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55, and "Authorize_Refund" occurs later at 08:30:02, which is the opposite order of the claim.
In Case 1003, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, and "Authorize_Refund" occurs later at 10:22:18, again contradicting the claim.
