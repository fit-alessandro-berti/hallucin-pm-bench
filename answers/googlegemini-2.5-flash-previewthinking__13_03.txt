Based strictly on the provided data excerpt:

1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1 stark** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ This snippet represents only a tiny fraction of the full month-long log (March 2025). It contains data for just three cases spanning a limited timeframe on a single day. The frequency of an activity observed in such a small sample size may not be statistically representative of its actual prevalence across the entire process and volume of cases over a full month. Extrapolating from this limited snapshot would likely lead to misestimating how common manual fraud checks truly are in the complete dataset.
