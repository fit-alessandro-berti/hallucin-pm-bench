Here are the answers based strictly on the 18 log lines provided:

**1. Exact count of "Manual_Fraud_Check"**
It occurs **1** time (in case A1002).

**2. Percentage of all logged events**
With 1 occurrence out of a total of 18 events:
$1 \div 18 \approx 5.555...\%$
**5.56%**

**3. Case identifier(s) with "Manual_Fraud_Check"**
**A1002**

**4. Two sampling-related reasons the estimate is unreliable**
1.  **Insufficient Sample Size:** The dataset consists of only 4 cases (18 events), which is too small to be statistically significant for extrapolating trends across an entire month.
2.  **Temporal Bias (Limited Time Window):** The data covers only a 5-hour window (9:00 AM to 2:05 PM) on a single specific date (May 1st). This fails to account for weekends, evenings, or variations that might occur at different times of the month.
