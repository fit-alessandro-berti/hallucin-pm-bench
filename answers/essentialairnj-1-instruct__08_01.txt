T5 cannot fire before T3.

Justification:  Let's consider the state of the net from the perspective of the tokens transitioning through the arcs. The firing sequence can be described by linearizing the Petri-net into a stepwise sequence of transitions fired in response to token movements combined with the Petri-net's structure. We start with p0(p1(0) p2(0) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0). T1 first fires to create two distinct tokens in p1 and p2. At this point, neither T3 nor T5 can fire. Now T3 must fire next, because only T3 can consume the token in p2. Only then can T5 fire, because this is allowed as long as p4 has no tokens.

Firing Sequence:
1. Initial state: p0(1) p1(0) p2(0) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)
2. T1 fires: p0(0) p1(1) p2(1) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)
3. T3 fires: p0(0) p1(1) p2(0) p3(1) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)
4. T5 fires: p0(0) p1(1) p2(0) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(1)

This proves that T5 can only fire after T3, and hence it is not possible for T5 to fire before T3.
