Add a single SLA escalation path using non-interrupting Timer Boundary Events on all pre-triage work.

- Attach a non-interrupting Timer Boundary Event (e.g., TB_SLA) to Task_Receive, Task_Check, and Task_RequestDocs.
- Configure the timer as timeDate = #{claimDeadline}, where claimDeadline = Start_Claim timestamp + PT48H (set as a process variable on Start_Claim).
- Route each TB_SLA via one sequence flow to an Escalation End Event (End_Escalated, name “Auto‑Escalated”).

Result: whichever pre-triage activity is still active at the 48‑hour mark triggers auto‑escalation; if Task_Triage is reached earlier, no timer fires. No new tasks added; only events and flows referenced (Task_Receive, Task_Check, Task_RequestDocs, Task_Triage).
