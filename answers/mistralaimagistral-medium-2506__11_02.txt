**Executive Memo: Claims Handling Performance Review (Q1-2025)**

**Key Issues:**
The three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Request_Documents**: High rework (22%) and extreme wait times (150 min) indicate inefficiencies in document collection, likely due to unclear requirements or customer delays. The low throughput drop (280 → 190 cases/day) suggests a bottleneck.
2. **Review_Documents**: High processing variability (SD=9 min) and a 12.4% SLA breach rate reveal inconsistent review complexity or staff capacity issues.
3. **Initial_Assessment**: Elevated wait time (18 min) and 3.2% SLA breaches imply bottlenecks or insufficient ресурсов for early-stage evaluations.

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Request_Documents**: Streamline templates/checklists to reduce rework and pre-validate document requirements.
- **Review_Documents**: Reduce variability with tiered review SLAs (e.g., splitting simple/complex cases) and training.
- **Initial_Assessment**: Expand FTE support during peak hours to trim queue times, given the bottleneck starts here.

*Note: Wait times (e.g., `Initial_Assessment`) could reflect downstream backlogs; deeper root-cause analysis is needed for systemic fixes.*

*Rationale:*
- Prioritized activities with >20% rework, >10% SLA breaches, or extreme wait times (>30 min).
- Actions target the most acute metric for each activity (e.g., rework vs. wait time).
- Avoided speculating on absent activities (e.g., "None").
