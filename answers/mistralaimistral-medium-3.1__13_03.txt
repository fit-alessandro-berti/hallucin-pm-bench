1️⃣ The **exact** activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in the provided excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ This snippet is a **non-random, tiny sample** (3 cases, ~0.001% of a month’s volume). An analyst might misestimate frequency due to:
- **Sampling bias**: Manual checks may cluster in specific timeframes (e.g., high-risk periods) not captured here.
- **Activity label variability**: Similar steps (e.g., *“Fraud Check (Manual)”*) could exist but use different strings, splitting counts.
- **Missing context**: The log may omit cases with manual checks (e.g., rejected applications not shown).
- **Temporal skew**: March 1st behavior might not reflect the full month (e.g., weekend vs. weekday patterns).
Without the full log, **generalizing from 3 cases is statistically invalid**.
