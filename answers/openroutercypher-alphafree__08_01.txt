No.

Proof of impossibility:

1. Consider the initial marking where only place `p0` (the start place) has one token. 

2. To reach a marking where `T5` can fire, place `p3` must have at least one token (`p3 +`) and place `p4` must have *zero tokens* (`p4 -|`). Transition `T5`'s firing depends on these conditions. 

3. To have a token in `p3`, transition `T2` (from place `p1`) must fire first. Transition `T2` is the only path leading into place `p3`. 

4. To have zero tokens in `p4`, transition `T3` cannot have fired yet. Transition `T3` is the *only way* tokens can be added to place `p4` (`p2 → p4`).

5. However, to make transition `T2` enabled, transition `T1` (from place `p0`) must first fire, which splits tokens into both `p1` (enabling `T2`) and `p2` (placing a token in `p2`, which enables `T3`).

6. Therefore, due to the synchronising parallel split `T1`, both `T2` *and* `T3` have their respective enabling transitions occurring at the same time after the first split.

7. Consequently, transition `T3` can fire immediately after `T1`, before `T2` even gets a chance to execute. This sequence `T1 → T3 → T2 → T5` *or* `T1 → T2 → T3 → T5` is possible, but not `T1 → T2 → T5 → T3`.

In summary, because transitions `T2` (enabling `T5`) and `T3` (filling `p4`) are both enabled immediately following the parallel split, transition `T5` *cannot* fire *before* `T3` because both rely on the same initial split and placement of tokens into `p1` and `p2`, and filling `p4` by `T3` is what prevents `T5` from firing if it has already fired.
