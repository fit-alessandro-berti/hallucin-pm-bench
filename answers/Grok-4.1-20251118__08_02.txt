**Question 1.** No.

**Question 2.** It is impossible for T5 to fire before T3.

To fire T5, place P5 must have a token, which is only produced by T4.  
T4 requires a token in P4, which is produced either by T2 or by T3.  
The first way to reach P4 is via the short path T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 (P5 gets token, but P2 still has its token).  
The long path that also puts a token in P4 is T1 → T3 → …, so T3 must fire to create the second token in P4.  
Thus T3 always fires before any enabling (and firing) of T5. No reachable sequence allows T5 before T3.
