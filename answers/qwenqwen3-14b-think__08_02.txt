**Answer 1:** Yes.  
**Answer 2:** T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5.  

**Explanation (115 words):**  
T5 requires P2 and P5. After T1 (P0→P1,P2), T2 (P1→P3) and T7 (P3→P4) enable T4 (P4→P5). At this point, P2 (from T1) and P5 (from T4) are present, allowing T5 to fire before T3. T3 (P2→P4) would later fire if P2 remains unmarked. The sequence T1→T2→T7→T4→T5 achieves this, as T5 consumes P2 and P5, enabling T5 to precede T3.
