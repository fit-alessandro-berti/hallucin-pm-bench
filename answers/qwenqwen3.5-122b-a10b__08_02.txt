Yes. Transition T5 requires tokens in P2 and P5. T1 produces P2. The parallel path T2 → T7 → T4 produces P5 independently of T3. After firing [T1, T2, T7, T4], the marking is {P2, P5}. Both T3 and T5 are enabled, competing for the single token in P2. T5 can fire immediately, consuming P2 and disabling T3. Thus, T5 fires before T3.

Minimal firing sequence: [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5].
