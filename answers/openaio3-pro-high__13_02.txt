3. With just one occurrence, “Manual_Fraud_Check” has little statistical weight. If we build performance metrics or predictive models from this excerpt, the single case could unduly influence average throughput times, variant discovery, or transition-probability estimates—either exaggerating its importance or causing overfitting. Subsequent decisions (e.g., staffing, risk scoring) based on such skewed insights may misallocate resources or misclassify future claims.
