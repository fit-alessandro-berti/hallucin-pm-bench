**a) Decision points**

- **Conditional branch after Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check (Step 4):**  
  If the risk rating is *Low* or *Medium* **and** the requested loan amount is ≤ €250 000, the *Manual‑Underwriting‑Review* step is skipped.

- **TriVote decision gate (Step 6):**  
  The loan passes if any two of the three mandated approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) grant approval.
