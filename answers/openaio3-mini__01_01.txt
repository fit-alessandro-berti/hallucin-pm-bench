Below is a breakdown of every decision point in Contoso Airlines’ flight‐refund process and a list of all the required documents:

DECISION POINTS

1. Eligibility Verification (Triage Stage)
 • When the customer submits a claim using the RefundRequestForm, a triage agent then evaluates the claim using the FlightManifest and WeatherReport. This stage implicitly decides whether the claim meets the eligibility criteria to proceed.

2. High-Value Claim Check
 • After the Finance Controller has given the pre-approval (using the EligibilityChecklist), the process branches based on the refund amount. If the refund amount is greater than €1,000, the case is routed for an additional Senior Auditor review. This decision point explicitly distinguishes between standard claims and high-value claims, ensuring that the Senior_Auditor_Review—with its associated AuditTrail—is completed for high-value claims before payment.

3. Financial Pre-Approval Decision
 • The Finance_Controller_PreApprove stage, which uses the EligibilityChecklist, acts as a decision point for releasing the claim for payment processing. Process_Refund_Payment cannot begin unless this approval is secured—and, for high-value claims, only once the Senior_Auditor_Review (with the AuditTrail) is also completed.
