**Question 1.** Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**. This can occur if the process follows a path that allows **T5** to be enabled before **T3**.

**Question 2 (bonus).** One minimal firing sequence is:
  T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5 → T3

In this sequence, **T5** is enabled and fired before **T3** because **T4** and **T5** are both enabled after **T2** and **T7** have been executed.
