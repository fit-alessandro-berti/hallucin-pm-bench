### Answer  
**No**  

### Justification  
The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" **always** occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no intervening activities. However, the event log contains **two counterexamples** where this does not hold:  

1. **CaseID C002**:  
   - Sequence: `Receive_Order` (2025-01-03T09:30:00) → **`Pack_Items`** (2025-01-03T09:50:00) → `Validate_Payment` (2025-01-03T10:05:00).  
   - **Violation**: `Pack_Items` occurs immediately after `Receive_Order`, not `Validate_Payment`. An intervening activity exists.  

2. **CaseID C004**:  
   - Sequence: `Receive_Order` (2025-01-03T10:05:00) → **`Check_Fraud`** (2025-01-03T10:07:00) → `Validate_Payment` (2025-01-03T10:20:00).  
   - **Violation**: `Check_Fraud` occurs immediately after `Receive_Order`, not `Validate_Payment`. An intervening activity exists.  

#### Why this invalidates the FACT:  
- The FACT requires **zero intervening activities** between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment` in **all cases**.  
- Cases C001 and C003 comply (e.g., C001: `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment`), but **C002 and C004 explicitly violate the rule**.  
- Since the FACT uses the absolute term "always," **a single counterexample is sufficient to disprove it**. Here, two counterexamples exist.  

> **Key evidence**: The log shows non-compliance in 50% of relevant cases (2 out of 4 cases with both activities). Process-mining rules must hold for **all observed instances** to be valid.
