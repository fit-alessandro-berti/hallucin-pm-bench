It is not possible to compute the average cycle time (or standard deviation, or a 95 % confidence interval) for activity "Approve Invoice" with the information provided. The supplied event-log stub contains only column headers with timestamps and activity data entirely redacted. Without concrete timestamp data ("start_time" and "complete_time") for "Approve Invoice" events, there is insufficient information to derive these metrics.
