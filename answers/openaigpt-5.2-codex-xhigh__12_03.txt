**No.**

**Justification:**  
The log shows cases where **other activities occur between** *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*:

- **C002:** `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
- **C004:** `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment`

Only **C001** and **C003** have *Validate_Payment* immediately after *Receive_Order*, so the statement is **not always true**.
