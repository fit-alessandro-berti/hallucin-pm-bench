### Answers:

1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt.  
*(Evidence: CaseID 1002, Activity: “Manual Fraud Check”)*

2️⃣ This snippet shows only 3 cases, with “Manual Fraud Check” occurring in 1 of them (33%). Analysts might misestimate its frequency because:  
- The sample size is tiny (3 cases) and unrepresentative of the full month’s log.  
- It lacks context on case complexity, risk profiles, or temporal patterns (e.g., manual checks may spike weekly).  
- The snippet includes a manual check (Case 1002) but omits cases with no fraud checks or multiple checks, skewing perception.  
Without full data, any extrapolation risks significant error.
