**No.** In case C003 (lines 6–7), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 10:43 before *Receive_Order* at 10:45, so it **precedes** rather than follows *Receive_Order*. Additionally, in case C005 (lines 11–12), *Validate_Payment* occurs without any *Receive_Order* event in the case at all. These two cases directly contradict the claim that *Validate_Payment* **always** follows *Receive_Order* in the log.
