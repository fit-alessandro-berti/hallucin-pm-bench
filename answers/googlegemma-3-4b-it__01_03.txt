Okay, let’s break down Acme Bank’s small business loan approval process according to your provided definition.

**a) Decision Points Summarised:**

Here’s a summary of each decision point, described in a single sentence:

1.  **Risk Assessment (Tri-Color-Risk-Check):** The Tri-Color-Risk-Check determines the risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) based on three scorecards – Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow.
2.  **Amount Threshold Skip:** If the risk score is Low or Medium *and* the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, the process skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review.
3.  **TriVote Decision Gate:** A loan is approved if at least two out of three approvals (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) are received.



**b) List of Required Documents (in order of appearance):**

1.  Form 14B (Receive-Application Document)
2.  Deck Memo (Manual-Underwriting-Review Document)
3.  Offer Sheet 77 (Prepare-Binding-Offer Document)
4.  Signed Offer Sheet 77 (Request-Applicant-Confirmation Document)
5.  ID Matrix Declaration (Request-Applicant-Confirmation Document)
6.  Loan Dossier 2025 (Finalize-Agreement Document) 


Do you want me to delve deeper into any particular aspect of the process, such as the significance of the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, the role of each decision gate, or anything else about Acme Bank’s loan approval system?
