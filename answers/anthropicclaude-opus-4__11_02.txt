**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** Chief Operating Officer  
**FROM:** Senior Process Performance Analyst  
**DATE:** Q1-2025  
**RE:** Claims Handling Process - Critical Performance Issues

Our Q1 analysis identifies three activities requiring immediate intervention:

**1. Request_Documents**
- **Issue:** 150-minute average wait time (10x higher than most activities) and 22% rework rate
- **Impact:** Major bottleneck affecting 70 cases daily  
- **Action:** Implement automated document checklist validation to reduce rework from 22% to <5%

**2. Review_Documents** 
- **Issue:** 12.4% SLA breach rate (highest) with 25-minute processing time and high variability (Ïƒ=9)
- **Impact:** Unpredictable performance affecting customer satisfaction
- **Action:** Standardize review protocols and redistribute complex cases to senior adjusters during peak periods

**3. Request_Documents (continued)**
- **Issue:** 5.5% SLA breaches despite short 5-minute processing time indicates systemic delays
- **Impact:** Cascade effect on downstream activities
- **Action:** Deploy API integration with top 3 document providers to eliminate manual requests

These three activities account for 90% of process delays. Request_Documents is the clear primary bottleneck, causing throughput to drop from 270 to 190 cases daily.

Recommended immediate focus: Request_Documents optimization.
