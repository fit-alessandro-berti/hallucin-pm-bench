### **Added tasks**
- `Task_VerifyIdentity` (inserted between `StartEvent_1` and `Task_ReviewApplication`).
- `Task_RequestDocs` (new branch from `Gateway_Decision` for "missing docs").
- `Task_FinalReject` (replaces `Task_RejectLoan` with a renamed/repurposed task for "ineligible" cases).

---
### **Removed tasks**
- `Task_RejectLoan` (replaced by `Task_FinalReject`).

---
### **Gateway-type changes**
- **`Gateway_Decision`**:
  Changed from **Exclusive** (v1) to **Inclusive** (v2), enabling parallel paths (e.g., an applicant could be both "eligible" *and* "missing docs" simultaneously).
  *Note*: The gateway’s name also changed subtly ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check"), but this was ignored per instructions.
