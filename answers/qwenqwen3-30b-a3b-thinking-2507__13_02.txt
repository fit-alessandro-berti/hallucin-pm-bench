1. **1 time** (only in case C05)  
2.  
   a) **2.08%** (1/48 × 100 = 2.0833... → 2.08)  
   b) **8.33%** (1/12 × 100 = 8.333... → 8.33)  
3. A single occurrence (1/48 events, 1/12 cases) is statistically insignificant. Generalizing from such low support misrepresents the standard process, potentially causing predictive models to overemphasize rare paths, skewing performance metrics (e.g., falsely implying manual checks are routine) and leading to poor resource allocation or inaccurate process optimization.
