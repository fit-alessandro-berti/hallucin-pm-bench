1. **Average cycle time of "Approve Invoice":**  
   **Cannot be computed.**  

2. **Standard deviation and 95% confidence interval:**  
   **Cannot be computed.**  

3. **Reason:**  
   Artefact A contains no actual data rows, timestamps, or activity instances. To compute cycle time (end time – start time) for "Approve Invoice", both `start_time` and `complete_time` values for every instance of this activity are required. Artefact B references a KPI about the time *between* two activities (Approve Invoice → Pay Invoice) but provides no granular data about the duration *of* the "Approve Invoice" activity itself. No statistical metrics can be derived without access to timestamped event-log records.
