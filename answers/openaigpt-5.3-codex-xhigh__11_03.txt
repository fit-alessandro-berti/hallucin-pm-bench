COO, the data shows three priority bottlenecks when SLA breach and waiting time are considered together. Legal Approval is averaging 900s throughput against a 600s SLA, so it is 300s over target, with 600s average waiting. Risk Review is averaging 600s against a 300s SLA, also 300s over target, with 480s waiting. Credit Assessment is averaging 300s against a 240s SLA, 60s over target, with 200s waiting. These three combine the largest SLA overruns with the highest waiting times among SLA-breaching activities.

- Legal Approval: set a queue-time cap at 300s (current 600s) and trigger escalation above that cap; reducing waiting by 300s closes the SLA gap for 465 cases.
- Risk Review: set a queue-time cap at 180s (current 480s) with SLA-priority dispatching; reducing waiting by 300s closes the SLA gap for 480 cases.
- Credit Assessment: set a queue-time cap at 140s (current 200s) with threshold escalation; reducing waiting by 60s closes the SLA gap for 1,175 cases.
