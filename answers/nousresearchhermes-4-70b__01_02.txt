The Micro-loan Fast-Track process at Acme Bank has a few key decision points. First, at the **Underwriter Alignment Gate**, if the risk scores from the **Dual Underwriter Split** (given by **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**) differ by more than 2 points, the decision is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee**. The second decision point occurs at the **Amount Threshold Decision**: if the loan amount is less than €15,000 the system issues an auto-approval, but if the amount is at least €15,000 then the loan proceeds to the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval** (MBA) for a final board vote.

The required documents to be submitted include the Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01), Proof of Address, Latest Income Statement, Community Impact Statement (CIS) template, Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet, and the Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF).
