Add a **boundary timer event** to the "Request Missing Docs" task (Task_RequestDocs) with a 48-hour duration from the initial claim submission. When this timer expires, create a sequence flow that bypasses the normal completion of Task_RequestDocs and routes directly to Task_Triage for auto-escalation.

This ensures that even if documents remain incomplete, the claim will automatically proceed to triage within the 48-hour SLA window. The timer boundary event acts as an escalation mechanism that prevents claims from getting stuck in the documentation loop (f4 → Task_RequestDocs → f6) beyond the required timeframe, while preserving all existing activities and their core functionality.
