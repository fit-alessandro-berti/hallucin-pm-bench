**Answer 1.** No. T5 requires tokens in P2 and P5. P5 needs T4 to fire, which requires a token in P4. While T3 (P2→P4) can be fired via P2’s initial token (post-T1), T5 cannot fire before T3 because T3 directly enables P4→P5→P2’s dependency for T5. T5’s condition inherently depends on T3’s prior execution to provide P4→P5. Thus, T5 fires only after T3.  

**Answer 2.** N/A.
