1️⃣ Based solely on the provided data excerpt, the activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs exactly **1 time** (for CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because:
• The snippet reveals only one manual check but shows an automated check appearing in two cases (with different labels, suggesting potential inconsistency in naming conventions).
• One of three sampled cases (1002) underwent a manual check, but such a small sample (3 cases) is statistically insufficient.
• No context exists to determine *why* a manual check occurred (e.g., was it a routine random check or triggered by risk factors?) or the overall proportion requiring manual review in the full dataset.
