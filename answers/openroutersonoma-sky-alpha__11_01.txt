Based on the last 12 months' data, the three worst-performing activities by average waiting time are ranked as follows:  

#1: Request_Documents (Avg: 36.5 hours, 95th percentile: 120.0 hours)  
#2: Send_Closure_Letter (Avg: 12.2 hours, 95th percentile: 44.0 hours)  
#3: Assess_Liability (Avg: 7.8 hours, 95th percentile: 16.4 hours)  

**Recommendations:**  
- For Request_Documents, automate 80% of routine document requests (leveraging 275 executions' patterns) to cut waiting by 25% (to ~27.4 hours avg).  
- For Send_Closure_Letter, prioritize staffing for high-volume cases (255 executions) via shift optimization, reducing waiting by 30% (to ~8.5 hours avg).  
- For Assess_Liability, implement parallel processing for 310 executions' simpler cases, slashing waiting by 22% (to ~6.1 hours avg).  

These actions target bottlenecks to improve efficiency.
