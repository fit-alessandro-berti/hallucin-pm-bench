Subject: Largest waiting-time bottlenecks in claims handling  

The three worst activities by waiting time are:

1) **Request_Documents (#1)** – Avg 36.5h; 95th 120.0h.  
   Action: Trigger document requests automatically at claim submission and auto‑escalate any case still waiting after 24h; capping these long waits below 48h would reduce average waiting well over 20%.

2) **Send_Closure_Letter (#2)** – Avg 12.2h; 95th 44.0h.  
   Action: Replace periodic batch generation with instant letter creation and dispatch once a decision is recorded; cutting the current 44h tail to <24h should lower waiting time by at least 20%.

3) **Assess_Liability (#3)** – Avg 7.8h; 95th 16.4h.  
   Action: Introduce rules-based triage to route straightforward claims to a same-day queue, compressing their waits from up to 16.4h to <8h and driving a >20% reduction overall.
