To calculate the average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract" across all cases in the log, we first need to identify all instances of "Review Contract" and their respective case_ids and elapsed times. However, since the elapsed-time fields have been redacted, we cannot directly compute the average cycle time from the provided data.

Therefore, the requested value **cannot be derived**. 

If the elapsed-time fields were available, the calculation would involve summing up the elapsed times for all "Review Contract" activities and then dividing by the number of occurrences of "Review Contract". 

For example, if the elapsed times for "Review Contract" were:
- C-001: x hours
- C-002: y hours
- C-003: z hours
- C-004: w hours

The average cycle time would be (x + y + z + w) / 4. 

But without the actual elapsed times, we cannot perform this calculation.
