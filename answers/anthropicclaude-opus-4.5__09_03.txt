# Analysis Response

## Computation Results

I cannot compute any of the requested metrics.

## Explanation

The average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity cannot be calculated because **no actual data has been provided**. Artefact A contains only column headers—every row of event data has been explicitly redacted, meaning there are no timestamp values (start_time, complete_time), no activity names, and no case identifiers available to analyze. To compute cycle time for any activity, I would need at minimum the start and completion timestamps for instances of that activity. To compute standard deviation and confidence intervals, I would additionally need multiple observations to establish a distribution. The SLA Catalogue in Artefact B provides a historical benchmark for a different metric (Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice duration), but this is not the same as the cycle time of the "Approve Invoice" activity itself, and using it would constitute drawing on information outside what the event log contains.
