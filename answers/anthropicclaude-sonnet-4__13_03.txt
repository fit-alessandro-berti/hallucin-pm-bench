**2️⃣ Why this snippet could mislead about manual fraud check frequency:**

This excerpt shows potential data quality issues that would skew analysis. There are inconsistent activity naming patterns - "Manual Fraud Check" vs "Automatic Fraud Check" vs "Fraud Check (Automatic)" - suggesting the full log may contain variants like "Manual Fraud Check (Extended)" or "Fraud Check (Manual)" that wouldn't be captured by exact string matching.

Additionally, this snippet shows only 3 cases from what appears to be a single morning timeframe of a month-long dataset. The sample is too small and temporally limited to represent true process patterns. Manual reviews might be more common during specific hours, days, or for certain application types not visible in this narrow window.
