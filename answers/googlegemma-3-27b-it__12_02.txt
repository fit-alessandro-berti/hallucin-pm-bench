No.

The claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order* is inaccurate. Case C003 demonstrates this: line 7 shows *Receive_Order* occurring at 2025-02-01T10:45:00Z, while line 6 shows *Validate_Payment* occurring *before* at 2025-02-01T10:43:00Z. Additionally, case C005 shows *Validate_Payment* (line 11) before *Cancel_Order* (line 12), and no *Receive_Order* is ever observed for this case. Therefore, the fact is demonstrably false based on the provided log fragment.
