### a) Summary of Decision Points

There are two distinct decision points (gates or conditional branches) in the process:

1.  **Conditional Branch (Step 4):** Determines whether the application proceeds to the Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5) based on the risk rating and the requested loan amount.
    *   *Rule:* Manual underwriting is skipped if the risk is Low or Medium ($\leq$ Medium) AND the requested amount is €250,000 or less.

2.  **Decision-Gate "TriVote" (Step 6):** Determines whether the loan application is approved and proceeds to preparing the binding offer (Step 7).
    *   *Rule:* The application is approved if at least two of the three required roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) provide their approval.
