## Decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process

1. **Eligibility validation (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility)**
   - **Decision:** Is the claim eligible based on checks against the defined sources?
   - **Basis for decision (required documents used in this step):**
     - *FlightManifest*
     - *WeatherReport*

2. **Finance pre-approval (Finance_Controller_PreApprove)**
   - **Decision:** Does the finance controller approve the refund based on the checklist?
   - **Basis for decision (required document used in this step):**
     - *EligibilityChecklist*

3. **High-value branching decision**
   - **Decision:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1 000**?
   - **If YES:** proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (and it must include the *AuditTrail*).
   - **If NO:** skip **Senior_Auditor_Review** and continue toward payment (subject to constraints).
   - **Required document when YES:**
     - *AuditTrail*

4. **Payment release gate (before Process_Refund_Payment)**
   - **Decision (constraint-based):** Are all prerequisite approvals complete?
     - **Always required:** **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** completed successfully.
     - **Additionally for high-value claims (> €1 000):** **Senior_Auditor_Review** completed.
   - **Document required for executing payment (must be present to process payment):**
