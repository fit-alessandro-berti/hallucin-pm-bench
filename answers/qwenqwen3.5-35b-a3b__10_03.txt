| Activity | Front-Office Analyst | Compliance Analyst | Compliance Officer | Treasury Ops |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Intake Vetting | R | | | |
| KYC Review | | R | | |
| AML Screening | | R | | |
| Risk Scoring | | R | C | |
| Compliance Officer Approval | | | R | |
| Payment Scheduling | | | | R |
| Fund Release | | | | R |
| Analyst Notification | I | | | R |

**Legend:** R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed

*Note: Accountable (A) for all activities is assigned to the Role marked Responsible (R) per narrative flow, consolidated to R for clarity in this view.*

*Correction on Legend/Content:* I need to ensure I explicitly mark A where needed or just follow standard RACI. Usually R and A are in the same cell or R is enough if A is implied. To be precise, I will mark R and A where applicable. However, standard RACI tables often just use the letters. I will put the letters in the cells. If R and A are the same, I will put "R, A".
Actually, to save space and keep it clean, I will assign A to the R owner for most.
Wait, strict "Using only the authorized vocabulary" might restrict me from adding explanations in the table. I will stick to just the letters in the cells.

*Refined Plan:*
1.  Ensure Activity column uses exact authorized terms for the 4 key steps.
2.  Ensure Activity column uses narrative terms for non-key steps (Compliance Officer Approval, Payment Scheduling, Fund Release, Analyst Notification).
3.  Ensure no role names are changed.
4.  Ensure no forbidden synonyms appear in the table (e.g. "CDD" in a footnote).
5.  Ensure "R", "A", "C", "I" are used.

*Re-evaluating "Accountable":*
*   Intake Vetting: Front-Office Analyst (R, A).
*   KYC Review: Compliance Analyst (R, A).
*   AML Screening: Compliance Analyst (R).
*   Risk Scoring: Compliance Analyst (R).
*   Approval: Compliance Officer (R, A).
*   Payment Scheduling: Treasury Ops (R).
*   Fund Release: Treasury Ops (A).
*   Notification: Treasury Ops (R), Front-Office Analyst (I).

I will put "R/A" in the cells to be accurate, or just "R" if A is implied. I will use "R/A" to denote Accountability where the Responsible party is also Accountable.

*Wait, one more check:* "Do not rename, merge, or add activities".
I am using "Intake Vetting" instead of "Preliminary Assessment". This is a rename.
I am using "KYC Review" instead of "CDD". This is a rename.
I am using "AML Screening" instead of "Sanctions Check". This is a rename.
I am using "Risk Scoring" instead of "risk rating". This is a rename.
This conflict is resolved by the System Vocabulary Policy overriding the User "do not rename" instruction regarding the specific terms defined in the Vocabulary Policy.

*Final check on Vocabulary:*
*   Intake Vetting (Used)
*   KYC Review (Used)
*   AML Screening (Used)
*   Risk Scoring (Used)
*   No "CDD", "Sanctions Check", "risk rating", "Preliminary Assessment".
*   Role names: Front-Office Analyst, Compliance Analyst, Compliance Officer, Treasury Ops.

Let's assemble the table.

| Activity | Front-Office Analyst | Compliance Analyst | Compliance Officer | Treasury Ops |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Intake Vetting | R/A | | | |
| KYC Review | | R/A | | |
| AML Screening | | R | | |
| Risk Scoring | | R | C | |
| Compliance Officer Approval | | | R/A | |
| Payment Scheduling | | | | R |
| Fund Release | | | | R/A |
| Analyst Notification | I | | | R |

Wait, I should check if I need to define the "I" and "C" in the cells or just list the letters. I will list the letters.

One more check: "Using only the authorized vocabulary...". This is still slightly ambiguous. Does it mean I can't use "Compliance Officer Approval" if that's not an authorized term?
If I strictly use *only* the 4 authorized terms, I can't list other activities.
Given the instruction "cover every activity... described above", I must list the other activities.
I will assume "Using only the authorized vocabulary" applies to the specific vocabulary policy terms (Intake Vetting, etc.) when referring to those concepts.
I will also ensure I don't use "risk rating" in the "Risk Scoring" row description if I were to add descriptions, but I am keeping descriptions out of the cells.

Final decision: Use the letters for RACI roles. Use the Activity names as mapped (4 authorized terms + narrative terms for the rest).

Wait, I should check if "Compliance Officer Approval" is considered an activity name that *could* be a synonym for one of the 4 terms? No.
Okay, proceeding.

Wait, I need to make sure I don't output synonyms in the *Activity* column header or elsewhere.
I will keep the table clean.

One adjustment: "Do not rename... activities".
If I change "Preliminary Assessment" to "Intake Vetting", I am technically renaming.
But the System Prompt says "Vocabulary policy (STRICT): Always write 'Intake Vetting'".
I must follow the System Prompt.
I will proceed.

One final check on "Risk Scoring". Narrative: "analyst derives a risk rating". I must use "Risk Scoring".
One final check on "AML Screening". Narrative: "Sanctions Check". I must use "AML Screening".
One final check on "KYC Review". Narrative: "Customer Due Diligence". I must use "KYC Review".
One final check on "Intake Vetting". Narrative: "Preliminary Assessment". I must use "Intake Vetting".

Okay.

One last check on RACI assignments.
*   Front-Office Analyst performs Intake Vetting. (R/A)
*   Compliance Analyst performs KYC Review. (R/A)
*   Compliance Analyst performs AML Screening. (R)
*   Compliance Analyst performs Risk Scoring. (R). Compliance Officer is consulted for the threshold? Narrative says "escalate for approval". So CO is Consulted on the scoring? Or only on Approval? Usually, CO is Consulted on Risk Scoring if it's the trigger. I'll put C there.
*   Compliance Officer performs Approval. (R/A)
*   Treasury Ops schedules payment. (R)
*   Treasury Ops releases funds. (R/A)
*   Treasury Ops notifies Analyst. (R). Analyst is Informed. (I)

Looks correct.

One detail: "do not rename, merge, or add activities".
I have kept them distinct (Scheduling vs Release vs Notification).
I have renamed the 4 specific terms as mandated by System Policy.
I will output the table now.
I will add the Legend to explain R, A, C, I. This is necessary for a RACI matrix. Is Legend allowed? "Using only the authorized vocabulary...". Legend uses R, A, C, I. These are standard. The forbidden words are specific activity names. I think Legend is fine.
Wait, "Using only the authorized vocabulary" could mean "Do not use *any* words other than the 4 activity names and role names".
If I do that, I cannot make a table with "Activity", "Front-Office Analyst" headers.
But the prompt asks for a "Markdown table".
I will interpret "Using only the authorized vocabulary" as "Use the authorized vocabulary for the specific activity names defined in the policy".
I will not write explanations in parentheses.

Let's double check if I should put "R/A" or separate cells. Standard RACI tables put the letter in the cell. If R and A are the same, "R/A" is common.
I will use "R" for Responsible and "A" for Accountable. If a role is both, I will write "R/A".
Wait, "Using only the authorized vocabulary" might restrict the content to *only* the 4 terms.
If I write "Compliance Officer Approval", is that allowed?
Given "cover every activity... described above", I have to list them.
Okay, I'll trust that "authorized vocabulary" refers to the terminology constraints for the specific terms, not a ban on standard RACI labels or role names defined in the Role Roster.

Wait, one constraint: "Do NOT output synonyms or alternative phrasings for these four activity names, even in explanations or parentheses."
This means I cannot write "Intake Vetting (Preliminary Assessment)". I will just write "Intake Vetting".
This confirms I should use the exact terms.

Okay, generating table.

**Key:** R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed.
