### **Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process**
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**
   - Decision: Verify claim eligibility based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.

2. **High-Value Claim Branch (Conditional Path)**
   - Decision: If refund amount > €1,000, route to **Senior_Auditor_Review**; otherwise, skip.

3. **Finance_Auditor_Oversight (High-Value Claims Only)**
   - Decision: Approval/rejection based on *AuditTrail* (explicitly required for high-value cases).

   - *AuditTrail* (**only** for high-value claims in Senior_Auditor_Review)
