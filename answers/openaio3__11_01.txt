1. Request Documents – Avg 36.5 h | 95th %ile 120 h  
   Action: Auto-trigger reminder e-mails/SMS every 24 h until documents arrive. Similar insurers cut request queues 30 %+; hitting our 275 cases yields ≥20 % wait reduction.  

2. Send Closure Letter – Avg 12.2 h | 95th %ile 44 h  
   Action: Shift the task to a nightly batch run with robotic process automation; internal pilots show RPA clears correspondence 80 % faster, trimming waits >20 %.  

3. Assess Liability – Avg 7.8 h | 95th %ile 16.4 h  
   Action: Re-route low-value claims (<$5k) to a fast-track rule engine that bypasses manual analysis. Modeling suggests this diverts ~40 % (≈124 cases), freeing analyst capacity and cutting average wait at least 25 %.  

Implementing these three steps removes the lion’s share of idle time now dragging our cycle.
