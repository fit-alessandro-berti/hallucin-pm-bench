**Yes**, it is possible.

A firing sequence where **T5** fires before **T3** is:

**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

**Formal Explanation:**
To fire transition **T5**, the places `pd` and `pe` must contain tokens.
1.  **T3** is the only transition that produces `pd` *and* consumes `pc`. If **T5** fires before **T3**, then `pc` must be empty (otherwise T3 would be enabled and might fire). If `pc` is empty, **T3** cannot fire. Consequently, the token for `pd` must be produced by the shortcut transition **T2b**, not **T3**.
2.  To fire **T2b**, we must first fire **T1** (producing `pa` and `pb`).
3.  Once **T1** fires, we have tokens in `pa` and `pb`. We can fire **T2b** (consuming `pa`, producing `pd`) while still leaving `pb` available.
4.  To enable **T5**, we also need a token in `pe`. This is produced by **T4**, which requires `pb`. Since we preserved `pb` from **T1**, we can fire **T4** (consuming `pb`, producing `pe`).
5.  With tokens now present in both `pd` (from T2b) and `pe` (from T4), transition **T5** becomes enabled and can fire. At this point, **T3** cannot fire because `pc` is empty (it was never produced, as we took the shortcut path T2b).

Thus, **T1, T2b, T4, T5** is a valid firing sequence where **T5** fires before **T3** (or where **T3** never fires at all).
