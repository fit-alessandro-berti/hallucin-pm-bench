**Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

**Shortest firing sequence:**
**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

***

**Explanation of the sequence (based on the net provided):**

1.  **T1** fires:
    *   Consumes token from `p0`.
    *   Produces tokens in `pa` and `pb`.
    *   *Marking:* `pa=1`, `pb=1`.
2.  **T2b** fires (the shortcut):
    *   Consumes token from `pa`.
    *   Produces token in `pd` (bypassing `pc` and `T3`).
    *   *Marking:* `pb=1`, `pd=1`.
3.  **T4** fires:
    *   Consumes token from `pb`.
    *   Produces token in `pe`.
    *   *Marking:* `pd=1`, `pe=1`.
4.  **T5** fires:
    *   Consumes tokens from `pd` and `pe`.
    *   Produces token in `pf`.
    *   *Marking:* `pf=1`.

In this sequence, `T5` fires, and `T3` (which requires a token in `pc`) has not fired. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.
