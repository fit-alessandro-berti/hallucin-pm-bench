To address the user's request, we need to focus on Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing and identify the tasks that can execute concurrently.

Process B is described as follows:
1. Accept_Custom_Order  
2. (Parallel Block P1) → Generate_CAD_Drawing  ||  Confirm_Materials_Availability  
3. Once P1 completes → (Parallel Block P2) → Milling_Panels  ||  Turning_Legs  ||  CNC_Detailing  
4. Dry_Fit_Assembly  
5. Glue_And_Clamp  
6. (Parallel Block P3) → Sand_Surfaces  ||  Apply_Stain  ||  Install_Hardware  
7. Final_Inspection  

The parallel blocks in Process B are P1, P2, and P3. Let's examine each to enumerate the tasks that may execute concurrently:

1. Parallel Block P1 contains: Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
   So, the tasks that can run in parallel in P1 are: Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability

2. Parallel Block P2 contains: Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
   So, the tasks that can run in parallel in P2 are: Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing

3. Parallel Block P3 contains: Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware  
   So, the tasks that can run in parallel in P3 are: Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

Now, listing each set of tasks that may execute concurrently as per the request:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing,Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels,Turning_Legs,CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces,Apply_Stain,Install_Hardware

The final answer is: 
1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware
