### Step-by-Step Analysis:

Let's evaluate each rule one by one against the provided trace.

#### Rule 1: High-value PO approval
- **Requirement**: For PO > â‚¬10,000, must have two approvals (Procurement Officer then CFO) before `Issue_PO`.
- **Trace Check**:
  - Approval by Procurement Officer (`Approve_PO` at event #2).
  - Approval by CFO (`Approve_PO_CFO` at event #3).
  - `Issue_PO` occurs at event #5, after both approvals.
- **Conclusion**: Compliant with Rule 1.

#### Rule 2: Expedite_Flag implications
- **Subrule 2.1**: `Quality_Check` is optional if `Expedite_Flag` exists.
  - `Expedite_Flag` exists (event #4).
  - `Quality_Check` does not appear in the trace, which is allowed.
- **Subrule 2.2**: `Risk_Assessment` must occur before first `Ship_Goods`.
  - `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8.
  - `Risk_Assessment` occurs at event #9 (after `Ship_Goods`).
- **Conclusion**: Non-compliant with Rule 2.2 (Risk_Assessment must occur *before* Ship_Goods, not after).

#### Rule 3: Three_way_match timing after Goods_Received
- **Requirement**: `Three_way_match` must occur within 2 activities after `Goods_Received`.
- **Trace Check**:
  - `Goods_Received` at event #6.
  - Next activities:
    - #7: `Move_to_Quality` (1st after Goods_Received).
    - #8: `Ship_Goods` (2nd after Goods_Received).
    - #10: `Three_way_match` (occurs at 4th position after Goods_Received, distance = 4 - 6 = 3 > 2).
- **Conclusion**: Non-compliant with Rule 3 (distance exceeds 2).

#### Rule 4: Intern activity after CFO activity
- **Requirement**: No `Intern` activity may directly follow a `CFO` activity.
- **Trace Check**:
  - CFO activity: `Approve_PO_CFO` at event #3.
  - Next activity (`Expedite_Flag` at #4) is by `System`, not `Intern`.
  - Other CFO activities: None in the trace.
- **Conclusion**: Compliant with Rule 4 (no violation observed).

#### Rule 5: Trace must end with Archive_Record
- **Requirement**: Trace must finish with `Archive_Record` and nothing after.
- **Trace Check**:
  - Last activity is `Archive_Record` (event #11).
- **Conclusion**: Compliant with Rule 5.

### Summary of Violations:
1. Rule 2.2: `Risk_Assessment` occurs after `Ship_Goods` (must be before).
2. Rule 3: `Three_way_match` occurs too late after `Goods_Received` (distance > 2).

### Final Answer:
Non-compliant.  
1. Rule 2.2 violated: Risk_Assessment must occur before Ship_Goods.  
2. Rule 3 violated: Three_way_match does not occur within 2 activities after Goods_Received.
