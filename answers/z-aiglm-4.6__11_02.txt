**TO:** Chief Operating Officer
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** [Current Date]
**SUBJECT:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review

Our Q1 dashboard reveals three critical underperformers in the claims process:

1.  **Request_Documents:** This is the primary bottleneck, with an extreme 150-minute queue time and a 22.0% rework rate. The high rework is likely causing the severe delay.
    *   **Action:** Analyze rework drivers to standardize the initial request, reducing back-and-forth and queueing.

2.  **Review_Documents:** This activity has the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), driven by a slow (25-min) and highly variable (9-min stdev) processing time.
    *   **Action:** Implement a standardized review checklist to reduce processing variability and errors.

3.  **Initial_Assessment:** This step creates an early bottleneck with an 18-minute wait and a 1.8% rework rate, impacting downstream activities.
    *   **Action:** Investigate resourcing and training to improve throughput and reduce the initial queue.
