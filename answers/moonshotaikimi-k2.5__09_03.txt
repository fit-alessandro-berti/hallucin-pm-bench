I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the activity “Approve Invoice” because Artefact A provides only the column headers of the event log; every row and every timestamp value—including the start_time and complete_time fields necessary to calculate activity durations—has been redacted for privacy. Without the actual temporal records for individual instances of “Approve Invoice,” no quantitative analysis of its cycle time is possible from the available artefacts.
