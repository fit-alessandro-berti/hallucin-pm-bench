It is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" because the supplied event log (Artefact A) contains no executable data. All event rows and timestamp values have been redacted for privacy, leaving only the column headers visible. Without specific start_time and complete_time values for individual activity instances, no durations can be calculated, and therefore no statistical metrics can be derived from the provided artefacts.
