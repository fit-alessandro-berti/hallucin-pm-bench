### Response
The average cycle time for the "Dual Authorization" activity **cannot be determined** because **no timestamps are present in the provided event log artefacts**. 

### Explanation:
- Cycle time calculation requires the start and end timestamps of an activity (e.g., when "Dual Authorization start" occurs and when "Dual Authorization complete" occurs).
- The sanitized log header and frequency table only show:
  - Activity names (e.g., "Dual Authorization start", "Dual Authorization complete").
  - Occurrence counts (e.g., 148,371 times each activity occurs).
- **Timestamps are missing**, making it impossible to compute the duration between start and completion. 

Thus, the value cannot be derived from the given data.
