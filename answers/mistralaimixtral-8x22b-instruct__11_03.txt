**Memo to COO: Addressing Worst-Performing Activities**

Three activities are underperforming due to significant SLA breaches and high waiting times:

1. **Risk Review**
   - **SLA breach:** 300s (actual: 600s; exceeds by 300s).
   - **Waiting time:** 480s.
   - **Action:** Implement a tiered review system to prioritize high-risk cases, reducing average processing time.

2. **Legal Approval**
   - **SLA breach:** 300s (actual: 900s; exceeds by 600s).
   - **Waiting time:** 600s.
   - **Action:** Automate routine approvals for low-risk cases, freeing legal teams for complex reviews.

3. **Credit Assessment**
   - **SLA breach:** 60s (actual: 300s; exceeds by 240s).
   - **Waiting time:** 200s.
   - **Action:** Deploy AI-driven pre-screening to flag high-risk applications early, reducing manual review time.

These actions target bottlenecks while leveraging existing data.
