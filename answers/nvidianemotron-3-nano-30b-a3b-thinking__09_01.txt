I’m unable to answer the request. The event‑log excerpt you provided lists only the activity names and associated resources; it does not contain any timestamp or elapsed‑time fields that would allow us to compute the duration of each activity. Consequently, the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the data supplied.
