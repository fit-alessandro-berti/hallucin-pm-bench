No. The claim is not supported by the fragment.

- **Case 1001** – The order is `… Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund …`. *Authorize_Refund* follows *Update_Inventory*, not precedes it.  
- **Case 1002** – The case contains `Authorize_Refund` but **no** `Update_Inventory` event at all, so the “immediately before” relationship cannot hold.  
- **Case 1003** – The order is `… Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund`. Again, *Authorize_Refund* occurs after *Update_Inventory* and is not adjacent.

Thus, across all three cases in the fragment, *Authorize_Refund* never occurs immediately before *Update_Inventory*. The stated fact is inaccurate.
