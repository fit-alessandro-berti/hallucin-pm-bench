Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Key Performance Issues  

The three worst-performing activities are **Review_Documents**, **Request_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.

1. **Review_Documents**  
   - Issues: Longest processing time (25 min), highest variability (9 min), high rework (5.3%) and the worst SLA breach rate (12.4%), while throughput drops to 185/day.  
   - Action: Introduce a standardized review checklist and targeted training for reviewers; track processing time and SLA breaches weekly to confirm at least a 20% reduction in average and variance.

2. **Request_Documents**  
   - Issues: Extremely high wait time (150 min), very high rework (22%), elevated SLA breaches (5.5%), and throughput falls to 190/day from 270 upstream.  
   - Action: Redesign request templates and implement pre-send validation rules; aim to cut rework to ≤10% and wait time by 50%.

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - Issues: Longer wait (18 min) and processing (12 min) than neighboring steps, with higher rework (1.8%) and SLA breaches (3.2%) than Check_Coverage.  
   - Action: Rebalance staffing to this step during peak hours and introduce quick triage for straightforward claims, targeting a 30% reduction in wait time and SLA breaches.
