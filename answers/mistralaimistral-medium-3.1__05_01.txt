Add a **non-interrupting boundary timer event** to **`Task_Check`** (id="Task_Check") with a 48-hour deadline. Set its outgoing flow to bypass **`GW_Docs`** and connect directly to **`Task_Triage`** (reusing `f6` logic).

Configure the timer’s **`conditionExpression`** to trigger only if the task hasn’t completed (e.g., `[status != 'complete']`). This auto-escalates stalled claims to triage without adding steps. The original happy path (`f3`→`GW_Docs`→`f5`/`f4`) remains unchanged for on-time processing.

*Why?* Boundary timers enforce SLAs invisibly, preserving existing logic while ensuring compliance. No new tasks—just a safeguard.
