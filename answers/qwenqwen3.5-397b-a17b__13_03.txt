2️⃣ This excerpt covers only three cases (1001–1003) within a single morning (2025-03-01). Extrapolating monthly frequency from n=3 is statistically unreliable. Visible naming inconsistencies (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)") indicate labeling variations exist, implying exact string matching may miss variants. Additionally, the subset's selection criteria are unknown; it may not represent typical volume. Without knowing the sampling method or total March volume, assuming this ratio reflects the full month risks significant error due to small sample size, observed naming inconsistencies, and potential selection bias inherent in viewing an excerpt rather than the complete event log.
