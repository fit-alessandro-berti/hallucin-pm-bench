**a) Decision points and their rules**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3)**

2. **Conditional branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 4)**  
   - Rule: **If** the risk rating is **Low or Medium** **and** the requested amount is **≤ €250 000**, the process **skips Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5)**; otherwise, Step 5 must be performed.

3. **Decision-Gate “TriVote” (Step 6)**  
   - Rule: The application passes the gate if **at least two of the three** required roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) **approve**; otherwise it fails.

4. **Applicant confirmation gate (Step 8)**  
   - Rule: The process can move to Finalize-Agreement (Step 9) only if the applicant **confirms by providing a Signed Offer Sheet 77 and an ID Matrix Declaration**.
