• Added tasks  
- `Task_ApproveLoan` renamed to `Task_VerifyIdentity` — no, renamed to `Task_VerifyIdentity`; then `Task_ApproveLoan` remains but renamed semantically in context; however, the key added task is **`Task_VerifyIdentity`**, which replaces or introduces the logic previously split between `Task_ReviewApplication` and a new gateway — but only one verification task appears. Actually, `Task_ApproveLoan` and `Task_RejectLoan` were replaced, and `Task_VerifyIdentity` is newly introduced as a distinct task (not in v1), representing the pre-review step. So added task: **`Task_VerifyIdentity`**.  
- `Task_RequestDocs` and `Task_FinalReject` were added.

• Removed tasks  
- `Task_ApproveLoan` original name remains but logic fragmented; ultimately, the **`Task_ApproveLoan` and `Task_RejectLoan` are removed**, with their inline task flow of `Task_RejectLoan` to `EndEvent_1` replaced by separate `Task_RequestDocs` and `Task_FinalReject` — thus original approval task is removed as a standalone, replaced by new flow. But since `Task_ApproveLoan` is filtered out in favor of `Task_VerifyIdentity` and later conditions, the original `Task_ApproveLoan` and `Task_RejectLoan` are conceptually removed.  
- The explicit approval and rejection tasks (`Task_ApproveLoan`, `Task_RejectLoan`) are no longer defined directly.

• Gateway-type changes  
- Gateway type changed from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`: `Gateway_Decision` name changed from "Eligible?" (exclusive) to "Eligibility Check" (inclusive), broadening the decision condition beyond binary yes/no.
