No

The fact is inaccurate because in case C003, Validate_Payment at line 6 precedes Receive_Order at line 7, violating the "follows" condition, and in case C005, Validate_Payment at line 11 occurs with no Receive_Order event for that case in the log, so it cannot follow it. Thus, Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order across all instances.
