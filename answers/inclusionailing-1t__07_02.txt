• **Added tasks**  
  - Task_VerifyIdentity (new initial task)  
  - Task_RequestDocs (new branching outcome from gateway)  
  - Task_FinalReject (replaces previous reject path, but is semantically a new task due to name and position change in logic)

• **Removed tasks**  
  - Task_RejectLoan (no longer present; replaced by Task_FinalReject with different incoming flow semantics)

• **Gateway-type changes**  
  - Gateway_Decision changed from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway` (behavioral shift allowing multiple outgoing paths to be taken under defined conditions)
