**Yes.**

It is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

### Concrete Firing Sequence
**T1 → T2 → T5 → T3**

### Justification
The following marking evolution demonstrates that T5 can be enabled and fired while T3 has not yet occurred:

1.  **Initial Marking ($M_0$):**  
    $p0=1$, all others $=0$.  
    *Only T1 is enabled.*

2.  **Fire T1:**  
    Token moves from $p0$ to $p1$ and $p2$.  
    **Marking ($M_1$):** $p1=1, p2=1$.  
    *(T3 is enabled but has not fired yet.)*

3.  **Fire T2:**  
    Token moves from $p1$ to $p3$.  
    **Marking ($M_2$):** $p2=1, p3=1, p4=0$.  
    *(T3 is still enabled but has not fired.)*

4.  **Check T5 Enablement:**  
    *   **Input ($p3$):** Contains 1 token ($\ge 1$). **Satisfied.**  
    *   **Inhibitor ($p4$):** Contains 0 tokens ($=0$). **Satisfied.**  
    *(Note: T3 has not fired, so no token has been placed in $p4$ to inhibit T5.)*

5.  **Fire T5:**  
    Token moves from $p3$ to $p6$.  
    **Marking ($M_3$):** $p2=1, p6=1, p4=0$.  
    *(T5 has fired. T3 has still not fired.)*

6.  **Fire T3 (Optional, to complete ordering):**  
    Since $p2=1$, T3 remains enabled and can fire subsequently.  
    **Marking ($M_4$):** $p4=1, p6=1$.

In this sequence, **T5 fires at step 3**, while **T3 fires at step 4** (or remains unfired). Thus, T5 fires before T3.
