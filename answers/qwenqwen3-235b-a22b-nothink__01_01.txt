### Decision Points in Contoso’s Flight-Refund Process:  
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision**: Determine if the passenger’s claim meets refund eligibility criteria by cross-referencing the *FlightManifest* (flight status/cancellations) and *WeatherReport* (weather-related disruptions).  

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   - **Decision**: Validate compliance with refund policies using the *EligibilityChecklist*. The finance controller either approves, rejects, or flags the claim for further review.  

3. **High-Value Branch**  
   - **Decision**: If the refund amount exceeds **€1,000**, escalate to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (requires an *AuditTrail* for documentation).

   - *EligibilityChecklist* (used by Finance Controller for pre-approval)
