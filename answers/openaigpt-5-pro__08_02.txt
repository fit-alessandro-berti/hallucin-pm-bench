Q1: Yes.

Q2: Minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Explanation: T1 places tokens in P1 and P2. Execute the P1 branch to reach P5 (T2 → T7 → T4), leaving the token in P2 untouched. Then T5 is enabled by tokens in P2 and P5 and can fire before T3 has fired. After T5, T3 cannot fire anymore (P2 is consumed).
