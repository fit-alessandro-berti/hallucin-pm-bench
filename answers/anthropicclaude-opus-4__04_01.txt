**Non-compliant**

Justification:

1. **Rule 1 - Violated**: While the PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000 and we see two approvals before `Issue_PO` (event #5), they were not done in the correct order. The rule requires approval "first by a *Procurement Officer* and then by the *CFO*". In the trace, `Approve_PO` by Procurement_Officer (event #2) occurs before `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO (event #3), which appears correct.

2. **Rule 2 - Violated**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), which triggers the rule that `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` (event #8) occurs before `Risk_Assessment` (event #9). This violates the rule.

3. **Rule 3 - Compliant**: After `Goods_Received` (event #6), `Three_way_match` (event #10) occurs within the next two activities. The activities between them are `Move_to_Quality` (event #7) and `Ship_Goods` (event #8), making the distance exactly 2.

4. **Rule 4 - Compliant**: Although `Approve_PO_CFO` is executed by CFO (event #3) and is followed by `Expedite_Flag` executed by System (event #4), there is no activity executed by an Intern that directly follows an activity executed by the CFO.

5. **Rule 5 - Compliant**: The trace finishes with `Archive_Record` (event #11) and contains nothing after it.

The trace violates Rule 2, making it non-compliant with rule set P2P-2025.R1.
