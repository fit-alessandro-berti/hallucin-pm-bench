1) Cannot be derived from the provided data.

2) The event log excerpt lacks timestamps or elapsed-time fields (they’re redacted), and there is no benchmark for “Review Contract.” To compute the average, we would need the duration of “Review Contract” for each occurrence (there are 4: C-001, C-002, C-003, C-004) using start/end timestamps or an elapsed-time field, then average them: average = (sum of durations) / 4. Without those durations, the value cannot be calculated.
