**Answer 1:** No.

**Answer 2:** T5 cannot fire before T3 because T5 requires both P2 and P5 to be marked simultaneously. Initially, only P0 is marked. To reach a state where T5 can fire, we need:
- P2 to be marked (requires T1, then T3)
- P5 to be marked (requires T1, then T2, T7, T4)

The earliest P5 can be marked is after the sequence T1→T2→T7→T4. However, T1 also enables T3, and since P2 must be consumed by T3 before T5 can use both P2 and P5, T3 must fire before T5. Therefore, no valid firing sequence exists where T5 fires before T3.
