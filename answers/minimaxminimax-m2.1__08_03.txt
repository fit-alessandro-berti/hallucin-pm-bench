**Answer:** **Yes.**  
T5 can fire before T3 has ever fired.

### Reasoning  

* T5 needs a token in **both** places **pd** and **pe**.  
* **pd** can be produced in two ways:  

  1. Directly from **pa** by the shortcut transition **T2b** ( pa → pd ).  
  2. Indirectly from **pa** → **pc** (by **T2**) and then **pc** → **pd** (by **T3**).  

* **pe** can be produced only from **pb** by **T4** ( pb → pe ).

Since **T2b** creates a token in **pd** without ever firing **T3**, we can obtain the required pair of tokens (**pd**, **pe**) while **T3** has never been enabled. Consequently, T5 can become enabled and fire **before** T3.

### Shortest firing sequence that achieves this  

| Step | Firing | Resulting marking (tokens) |
|------|--------|----------------------------|
| 0    | –      | p0 = 1 (others = 0) |
| 1    | **T1** (p0 → pa, pb) | pa = 1, pb = 1 |
| 2    | **T2b** (pa → pd) | pd = 1 (pa = 0) |
| 3    | **T4** (pb → pe) | pe = 1 (pb = 0) |
| 4    | **T5** (pd, pe → pf) | **T5 fires** (pd = 0, pe = 0, pf = 1) |

The marking after step 3 is  

\[
M = \{\,pd = 1,\; pe = 1,\; \text{all other places } 0\,\}.
\]

In this marking **T5** is enabled (it requires exactly the tokens present) while **T3** has never been fired (its input place **pc** is empty). Hence **T5 fires before T3**.

The sequence **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5** is of length 4, which is minimal because at least one transition is needed to create each of the two required input places of T5 (pd and pe) and the initial transition T1 is unavoidable. No shorter sequence can produce the needed pair of tokens.

### Formal statement  

In the reachable marking \(M = \{pd^{1},\,pe^{1}\}\) (all other places empty) the transition **T5** is enabled, and the transition **T3** has never been enabled in any prefix of the firing sequence that reached \(M\). Therefore, there exists a reachable marking in which **T5 fires before T3**. The shortest such firing sequence is \(\langle T1,\,T2b,\,T4,\,T5\rangle\).
