The data is **insufficient to confirm the fact**.

Justification:
- The fact claims that for each case in the fragment, the “Authorize_Refund” activity always occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory” within the same case.
- Examining the cases:
  - **Case 1001:** Sequence is Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued. Here, Authorize_Refund comes after Update_Inventory, not before.
  - **Case 1002:** Sequence is Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued (no Update_Inventory recorded).
  - **Case 1003:** Sequence is Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund. Here, Authorize_Refund comes after Update_Inventory.
- In none of the cases does “Authorize_Refund” occur immediately before “Update_Inventory.” In some cases, “Update_Inventory” comes before “Authorize_Refund,” and in another case, “Update_Inventory” is entirely missing before “Authorize_Refund.”
- Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data. The data are insufficient to say the fact is accurate or not, because the pattern does not hold in any of the observed cases.
