**Executive Memo: Analysis of Claims Handling Performance Q1-2025**

The following three activities show notable performance issues:

1. **Request Documents:**
   - High wait time (150 min.) drastically exceeds other activities.
   - Elevated rework rate (22%) indicates frequent repetitions, worsening throughput and SLA breaches (5.5%).
   - **Action:** Implement clear upfront document checklists to minimize incomplete initial submissions, thereby significantly reducing rework and wait times.

2. **Review Documents:**
   - Highest processing time (25 min.) and greatest variability (9 min.) among all activities.
   - Significant SLA breaches (12.4%) compounded by elevated rework rate (5.3%) causing productivity loss.
   - **Action:** Initiate focused training and clearer guidelines for document reviewers to standardize workflows, reduce variability, and minimize delays and rework.

3. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Considerable wait time (18 min.) and relatively lengthy processing phase (12 min.).
   - Substantial SLA breaches (3.2%) and notable rework rate (1.8%) reflect capacity and potential task complexity issues.
   - **Action:** Redistribute workload or moderately increase dedicated personnel in Initial Assessment to alleviate immediate queue build-up and enhance throughput stability.

These recommendations focus on tangible, data-supported improvements that directly tackle wait times, reworks, and processing variability to enhance overall claims productivity.
