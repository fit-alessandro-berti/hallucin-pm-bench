## Recommendation: Add an Interrupting Boundary Timer Event on `Task_RequestDocs`

Attach an **interrupting boundary timer event** (e.g., `Timer_Escalate`) to `Task_RequestDocs`, configured with `timeDuration = PT48H` (adjusted slightly downward—e.g., `PT47H`—to absorb time already spent in `Task_Receive` and `Task_Check`). Add a new sequence flow from `Timer_Escalate` directly to `Task_Triage`.

**Effect:** If `Task_RequestDocs` is still active when the timer fires, BPMN interrupts and cancels it, then routes the token straight to `Task_Triage`—acting as the required auto-escalation. The existing `f6` flow still handles the normal (docs-received) path. No new tasks are introduced; only an event and one sequence flow are added.
