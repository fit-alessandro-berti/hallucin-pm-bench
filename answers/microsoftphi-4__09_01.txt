1) The average cycle time for the activity "Review Contract" across all cases cannot be derived from the data provided. 

2) Explanation:

- The dataset provided includes a log of activities but does not contain any duration or timestamp information associated with each activity.
- Average cycle time calculation requires knowing the start and end times of each activity or, at the very least, the individual durations of each occurrence of the activity.
- Since no timestamps or duration values are included in the log header or the historical benchmark data related to the "Review Contract" activity, we cannot calculate its average cycle time.

Therefore, the requested average cycle time cannot be derived from the given data.
