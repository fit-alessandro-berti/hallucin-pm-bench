**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** COO, Acme Insurance
**FROM:** [Your Name], Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2025
**SUBJECT:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance â€“ Key Concerns and Recommendations

This memo summarizes key performance concerns identified within the Claims Handling process for Q1-2025. Three activities require immediate attention.

**1. Request Documents:** This activity demonstrates significantly elevated performance issues. The average wait time (150 minutes) is drastically higher than other steps, and the rework rate (22.0%) is also the highest. **Recommendation:** Implement automated document request reminders and integrate with a common document portal to expedite gathering.

**2. Review Documents:** The high average processing time (25 minutes) and significant variability (9 minutes) are concerning. The rework rate (5.3%) and SLA breach percentage (12.4%) further highlight difficulty. **Recommendation:**  Explore utilizing AI-powered document summarization tools to reduce review time and improve consistency.

**3. Initial Assessment:** While throughput is acceptable, the substantial wait time (18 minutes) and relatively high SLA breach rate (3.2%) suggest bottlenecks. **Recommendation:** Analyze upstream processes feeding into Initial Assessment to identify and eliminate wait time causes, potentially including prioritizing claims based on complexity.

Further investigation into the root causes of these issues is recommended.
