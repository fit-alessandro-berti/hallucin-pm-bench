1) No.

2) Counterexamples:
- C001: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items (immediate here, but see other cases)
- C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment (Pack_Items occurs between, so not immediate)
- C003: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order (immediate here, but see other cases)
- C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment (Check_Fraud occurs between, so not immediate)

Since in C002 and C004 another activity occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, the statement that Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order is false.
