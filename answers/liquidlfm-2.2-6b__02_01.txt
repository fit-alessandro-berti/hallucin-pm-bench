{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Qualify_Order",  // Note: The event "Validate_Order" was recorded twice for the same case and is likely the "Validate_Order" activity, but "Qualify_Order" appears once before Ship_Order in other activity sequences; however, based on case A-9321, the last "Validate_Order" precedes Ship_Order, but the input says "Qualify_Order" is not a listed concept, so checking event flow: B-1045 alternates between Receive_Order and Validate_Order. The immediate preceding activity of Ship_Order for A-9321 is Ship_Order itself (from two events at 09:25). But rechecking the sequence: A-9321 applies Receive_Order at 08:05, Validate_Order at 08:16 → Pack_Items at 09:01 → Quality_Check at 08:45 → Pack_Items at 09:10 → Ship_Order at 09:20. So Ship_Order at 09:20 is preceded by Pack_Items at 09:10. However, there is no row for "Validate_Order" immediately before Ship_Order. Waiting for precise matching: from event 09:10 (Pack_Items) to 09:20 (Ship_Order), the logic must be case-specific. Looking at B-1045: Receive_Order, Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Quality_Check. Among these, Pack_Items (09:10) is followed by Quality_Check (08:45 is earlier), but Pack_Items (09:10) is before Quality_Check (08:45) time is earlier but not in sequence. But activity order in log for B-1045: Receive → Validate → Pack → Quality. For A-9321: Receive → Validate → Pack → Quality → Pack → Ship. So Ship_Order (09:20) for A-9321 is preceded by Pack_Items (09:10), but no Validate_Order before Ship_Order in any case’s activity chain. Thus, Q2’s answer relies on sequence strictly: Pack_Items precedes Ship_Order for A-9321. But the options are limited. Among active entries listed, no Validate_Order precedes Ship_Order in any case’s order. However, "Validate_Order" is an activity but not directly the one before Ship_Order in our sequence. Rechecking: B-1045 flips between Receive and Validate in order, while A-9321 goes to Pack after Validate. No Validate_Order precedes Ship_Order. But question Q2 asks “**immediately precedes**” — only Pack_Items follows Ship_Order in later events. Thus, no activity precedes Ship_Order in a case as the **immediate predecessor** in sequence. But looking strictly: which event immediately precedes Ship_Order? Pack_Items (09:10) is immediately before Ship_Order (09:20) for A-9321. So Q2 answer is Pack_Items.

  Q3: The earliest timestamp from the event log is 2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00 (from case B-1045 and "Receive_Order").

  Q4: The activity "Quality_Check" occurs at two events: one for A-9321 at 08:45:00 and one for B-1045 at 08:45:00 → so two times.

  Q5: The uniqueness of case IDs is determined by listing case IDs in order of appearance and noting duplicates:
    A-9321, B-1045, C-77 — are these the only ones? Looking at case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77 occur, but in what order? Events have case IDs: A-9321, A-9321, B-1045, B-1045, C-77. If reconstructing, A-9321 appears three times, B-1045 twice, C-77 once. But no updates about other cases, so only these three case IDs appear. So there are 3 distinct case IDs, but the question asks for **distinct case IDs that appear** — all cases with at least one occurrence. So only {A-9321, B-1045, C-77} are present — three distinct case IDs. But wait: question asks “How many distinct case IDs appear in the fragment?” — yes, three distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77. But that would make Q1 = 3, but earlier assumption was Q2 expected Validate_Order. But query says 1. Also Q5: ask for activities that **never appear as the first event** of any case.

    Reviewing events:
    - A-9321: First is Receive_Order (08:02)
    - B-1045: First is Receive_Order (08:05)
    - C-77: First is Quality_Check (10:00) — but Quality_Check is never a Receive/Validate/Pack etc. so never first? But the events are:
      - Case A shows: First is Receive
      - Case B shows: First is Receive
      - Case C: Quality_Check is first, but Quality_Check is not part of the initial receival-validate-pack workflow described elsewhere — but in C-77, it's "Quality_Check". But the question says "never appear as the first event of any case" in the **given fragment**. Looking at case C: the event is Quality_Check — so first is a different activity type. Another thing: case C has only one event: "C-77" with "Quality_Check". No other case starts with Quality_Check because others start with Receive or Receive then Validate. So among all cases, only C starts with Quality_Check, which is not considered "Receive_Order", "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", etc., but the question is about being a first event. The question does **not** assume first Must be one of the listed activities. So activities that never occur as first events are those where no case starts with such activity. The list of activities listed in the events are: Receive_Order, Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Quality_Check.

    Now, cases:
    - A-9321: starts with Receive_OK (first two events?) No: first event is Receive_Order (08:02), then Validate_Order (08:16). So first is Receive_Order.
    - B-1045: first event Receive_Order (08:05) — so first is Receive_Order (not Validate, Pack, or Quality, but Receive is a different type), but “Validate” is not first for this case.
    - C-77: first event Quality_Check — so never starts with Receive, Validate, Pack, or Quality_Check? No, it **does** start with Quality_Check — but Quality_Check is an activity, so as first, it’s valid, but it's not one of the three others mentioned in Q2 context. But the question is to find activities not used as first event of any case. But C starts with Quality_Check — so Quality_Check **does** appear as first event. Are there others?

      Only activities mentioned in the environment are Receive_Order, Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Quality_Check. The event for C-77 is Quality_Check, so first is Quality_Check — so Quality_Check **is** counted as a first event.

      No other case starts with Receive_Order, Validate, Pack — all cases start with Receive_Order or C-77. C-77 starts with Quality_Check, not Receive, Validate, or Pack. So:
      - First events:
        - A-9321 starts with Receive_Order
        - B-1045 starts with Receive_Order
        - C-77 starts with Quality_Check

      Activities that **do not** appear as first events:
      - Validate_Order — does it ever appear as first? No. Only sequence starts with Receive then Validate later.
      - Pack_Items — first event for any case? No — all start with Receive.

      So only Validate_Order and Pack_Items never appear as first event (since others start accordingly). But Pack_Items is only Pack_Items, which occurs in the middle? No, but in B-1045’s most recent, Pack_Items is at 09:10 — not first.

      So:
      - First events: all cases start with Receive or Quality_Check (only C). Receive is a different activity (first event) than Validate etc.

      Consider: what activity is **never** first event? Check:
        - Receive_Order: used for A and B — so first event
        - Validate_Order: not used at all as first
        - Pack_Items: never first (always follows Validate, etc.)
        - Quality_Check: used as first only (C) — but is there other case starting with Quality_Check? No. No other case is first with Validate or Pack, and A and B start with Receive. Only C starts with Quality_Check. So:
          Only Validate_Order and Pack_Items never appear as first events. But wait: do any case start with Pack_Items? No. A-9321 and B-1045 start with Receive.

      But is Pack_Items ever a first event? No — all cases have Receive first.

      So non-first-start activities: Validate_Order (never a first event), Pack_Items (never a first event). Also, are there any others? Quality_Check is a first event (only C), so not missing. Receive_Order: A and B start with it.

      So activities that never appear as first event:
        - Validate_Order
        - Pack_Items

    But wait: Q2 asks for the immediate predecessor of Ship_Order in case A-9321 — which is Pack_Items. And Pack_Items is also not a first event, which fits in Q5.

    So Q5 results are ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items"].

    Now consolidate:

    - Q1: Number of distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77 → 3
    - Q2: Immediately preceding Ship_Order in A-9321: Pack_Items (09:10)
    - Q3: Earliest timestamp: 08:05:00
    - Q4: Quality_Check occurs twice → count = 2
    - Q5: Activities never appearing as first event: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items"]
