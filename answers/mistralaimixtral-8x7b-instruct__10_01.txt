 Sure, I can create a RACI matrix using the preferred terminology. Here it is:

| Activity | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Receive Application | R | - | - | - |
| KYC Review | - | A | - | - |
| Order Vetting | R | - | A | - |
| Payment Clearance | - | - | R | - |
| Record Update | - | - | - | A |
| Notify Customer | R | - | - | - |

Here's what the acronym RACI stands for:

* R: Responsible - the person who performs the activity
* A: Accountable - the person who is ultimately responsible for the activity and its outcome
* C: Consulted - the person who provides input and is consulted during the activity
* I: Informed - the person who is updated on the progress and outcome of the activity

In this matrix, the activities are listed in the leftmost column, and the roles are listed in the topmost row. A dash (-) indicates that the role is not involved in the activity. The letters R, A, C, or I indicate the level of involvement of the role in the activity.

For example, for the activity "Receive Application", the Account Manager (AM) is responsible for performing it (R), while the other roles are not involved (indicated by a dash). Similarly, for the activity "KYC Review", the Compliance Officer (CO) is responsible for performing it, while the other roles are not involved.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
