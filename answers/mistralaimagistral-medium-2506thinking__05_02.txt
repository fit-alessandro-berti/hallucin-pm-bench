**Summary:**

The current process's total expected time is 12 days (sum of individual task due dates). To improve SLA compliance, we propose to adjust the due date of the "Grant System Access" task from 1 day to 2 days. This change increases the task's allowed time, reducing potential breaches due to tight deadlines, and maintains a realistic and achievable timeline for the entire onboarding process.

```diff
-    <bpmn:serviceTask id="Task_GrantAccess"   name="Grant System Access"    camunda:dueDate="P1D" camunda:type="external"/>
+    <bpmn:serviceTask id="Task_GrantAccess"   name="Grant System Access"    camunda:dueDate="P2D" camunda:type="external"/>
```

This change helps in reducing SLA breaches by providing more time for the "Grant System Access" task, which may have been struggling to comply with the original, tighter due date.
