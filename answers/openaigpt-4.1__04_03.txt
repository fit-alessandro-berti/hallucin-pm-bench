**Answer:** No

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1:** **Violated.** `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` both occur once, but the required order is QE **before** RA. In the trace, QE occurs before RA (**correct**).  
- **Rule 2:** **Violated.** Since severity = "High", `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must occur **after both** QE and RA. In the trace, VP occurs after both QE and RA (**correct**).
- **Rule 3:** **Violated.** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), but Rule 3 requires NA to occur **after both** QE and RA are complete (**violation**).
- **Rule 4:** **Satisfied.** `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after NA and VP (**correct** for high severity).

**Summary:** The trace violates **Rule 3** because `Notify_Authorities` occurred before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` was completed. All other rules are satisfied.
