**Suggestion:** Add a timer boundary event to `Task_RequestDocs` that triggers auto-escalation if the task exceeds 48 hours from submission.  
- Attach a non-interrupting timer boundary event (`<bpmn:boundaryEvent id="Timer_Escalate" attachedToRef="Task_RequestDocs" cancelActivity="false">`) with a timeDuration of `PT48H`.  
- Connect it directly to `Task_Triage` (reusing `f6`), ensuring the claim proceeds to triage even if docs aren't received.  
This enforces the SLA by auto-escalating slow requests while preserving the existing flow. No new tasks are added.
