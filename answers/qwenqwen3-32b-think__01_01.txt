**Decision Points in Contoso’s Flight-Refund Process:**  
1. **High-value branch evaluation** (after Finance_Controller_PreApprove):  
   - **Decision**: If the refund amount is greater than €1,000, the case proceeds to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (requires **AuditTrail**).  
   - **Eligibility for standard processing**: If the refund amount is ≤ €1,000, the process continues directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.  

**Required Documents:**  
1. **RefundRequestForm**: Provided by the passenger during **Customer_Submit_Claim**.  
2. **FlightManifest**: Used by the triage agent for **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**.  
3. **WeatherReport**: Used by the triage agent for **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**.  
4. **EligibilityChecklist**: Signed off by the finance controller during **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**.  
5. **AuditTrail**: Required for high-value claims during **Senior_Auditor_Review**.  
6. **BankTransferAuthorization**: Required to execute **Process_Refund_Payment**.  
7. **RefundConfirmationPDF**: Generated and emailed to the passenger as part of **Issue_Confirmation_Letter**.  

**Note**: No other decision points (e.g., customer service agent interventions) exist in the process as per the defined constraints and steps.
