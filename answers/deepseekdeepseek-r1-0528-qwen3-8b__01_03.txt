Okay, here are the decision points and document list synthesized from Acme Bank's small-business loan approval process description:

**a) Decision Points / Decision Gates:**

A decision point is defined as a fork/join point or a crucial condition evaluation that dictates the process flow.

1.  **Condition (Step 4):** If the Tri-Color-Risk-Check result is either Low or Medium *and* the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, skip the Manual-Underwriting-Review.
2.  **Gate (Step 6 - "TriVote"):** This process point requires that the loan application secure approval *from any two of the three specified reviewers* (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) before proceeding to the next stage.
    *   *(While the *participation* of each reviewer is required, the specific approval from *each* during the TriVote discussion is the necessary outcome for passing, hence the gate.*)

**b) Documents Required:**

Here are all the documents identified in the process, listed in the order they *first appear*:

1.  **Form 14B** (Step 1)
2.  **Deck Officer** role is assigned here, but the *document itself* is not named externally apart from users needing to fill it out.
3.  **Scorecard–Cyan**
4.  **Scorecard–Magenta**
5.  **Scorecard–Yellow**
6.  **Deck Memo** (Step 5)
7.  **Offer Sheet 77** (Step 7) - preparing this implies it exists or needs to be generated.
8.  **ID Matrix Declaration** (Required for Step 8, alongside Signed Offer Sheet 77)
9.  **Loan Dossier 2025** (Finalized Agreement)
