No

The fact is inaccurate. While C001, C002, and C004 show `Validate_Payment` following `Receive_Order` (C001: lines 1-2; C002: lines 3-5; C004: lines 8-9), `Validate_Payment` occurs *before* `Receive_Order` for case C003 (lines 6-7). Also, `Validate_Payment` is the first activity for case C005 (line 11), with no preceding `Receive_Order` activity for that case.
