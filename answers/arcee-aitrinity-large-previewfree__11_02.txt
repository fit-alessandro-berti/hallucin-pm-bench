**Executive Memo: Claims Handling Process Performance Review**

**Worst-Performing Activities & Analysis**

1. **Request Documents** – This activity exhibits severe bottlenecks: longest average wait time (150 minutes) and highest rework rate (22%), indicating repeated back-and-forth with customers. The low throughput (190) suggests capacity constraints.

2. **Review Documents** – Highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and substantial variability in processing time (stdev of 9 minutes), pointing to inconsistent review standards or resource allocation issues. Despite moderate wait times, the combination of high rework (5.3%) and processing time (25 minutes) creates significant delays.

3. **Initial Assessment** – Second-highest SLA breach rate (3.2%) and longest wait time among core processing activities (18 minutes), suggesting bottlenecks in early claim triage. High throughput (270) may strain resources, contributing to delays.

**Data-Driven Actions**

- **Request Documents**: Implement automated document collection portals with real-time tracking to reduce wait times and eliminate rework.
- **Review Documents**: Standardize review criteria and introduce parallel processing to reduce variability and SLA breaches.
- **Initial Assessment**: Allocate additional resources during peak hours to reduce wait times and improve throughput efficiency.
