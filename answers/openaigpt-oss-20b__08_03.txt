**Yes.**

The transition *T5* can be enabled from a marking that is reachable *without ever firing* *T3*.  
The reason is that *PD* can be produced by the **shortcut transition T2b**, which consumes the same
input token as *T2* (place *pa*) but skips the intermediate place *pc*.  
Once we have a token in *PE* (produced by *T4* from the other output of the split *T1*), both
pre‑conditions of *T5* are satisfied.

A shortest example of such a firing sequence is

| step | transition fired | marking after firing (non‑zero places shown) |
|------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **T1** | `p0=0,  pa=1,  pb=1` |
| 2 | **T2b** | `pa=0,  pb=1,  pd=1` |
| 3 | **T4** | `pb=0,  pe=1,  pd=1` |
| 4 | **T5** | `pe=0,  pd=0,  pf=1` |

After step 4, *T5* has fired **before** any occurrence of *T3*.  
Because the marking that enables *T5* is reachable and *T3* has not yet fired, the ordering
“*T5 before T3*” is indeed possible.

(Any shorter sequence is impossible because *T5* requires a token in *pd*, which can only be
generated by *T2b* or *T3*; a token from *T2b* must be produced first, and a token for *pe* from
*T4* must also be produced, giving at least four firings.)
