### Answer

**Yes.** Transition T5 can fire before T3.

**Shortest firing sequence:**

```
T1  →  T2b  →  T4  →  T5
```

### Why this works

| Step | Marking before the step | Fired transition | Marking after the step |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0    | p0 = 1                  | –                | p0 = 1                 |
| 1    | p0 = 1                  | **T1**           | pa = 1, pb = 1         |
| 2    | pa = 1, pb = 1          | **T2b**          | pd = 1, pb = 1         |
| 3    | pd = 1, pb = 1          | **T4**           | pd = 1, pe = 1         |
| 4    | pd = 1, pe = 1          | **T5**           | pf = 1                 |

* Up to step 3, **T3 has never fired** (pc is never marked).
* At step 4, both input places of **T5** (pd and pe) each contain one token, so T5 is enabled and fires.
* Hence T5 fires strictly **before** any occurrence of T3.

### Why no shorter sequence exists

* **T5** needs one token in **pd** and one in **pe**.
* **pe** can only be produced by **T4**, which itself requires a token in **pb**; **pb** is produced only by **T1**.
* **pd** can be produced without T3 by the shortcut **T2b**, but **T2b** also needs a token in **pa**, again obtained only from **T1**.
* Therefore, any sequence that enables T5 must include:

  1. **T1** (to create pa and pb)
  2. **T2b** (to create pd)
  3. **T4** (to create pe)
  4. **T5** itself
     giving a minimum length of 4 transitions, exactly as in the sequence above.

Thus it is both possible and minimal for T5 to occur before any firing of T3.
