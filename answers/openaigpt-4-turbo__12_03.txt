**No**, the above FACT is not accurate with respect to the event-log excerpt.

**Justification:**
1. In **CaseID C002**, the sequence is:
   - Receive_Order at 09:30:00
   - Pack_Items at 09:50:00
   - Validate_Payment at 10:05:00
   Clearly, the activity "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," not adhering to the fact that "Validate_Payment" should immediately follow "Receive_Order."

2. In **CaseID C004**, the sequence is:
   - Receive_Order at 10:05:00
   - Check_Fraud at 10:07:00
   - Validate_Payment at 10:20:00
   Here, the activity "Check_Fraud" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," which further invalidates the stated fact.

These sequences show that other activities can and do occur between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment,” contradicting the fact's assertion.
