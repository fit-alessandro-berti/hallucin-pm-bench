### Key
- **R** = Responsible (performs the task)
- **A** = Accountable (ultimately answerable; final approving authority where applicable)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input before the task is completed)
- **I** = Informed (kept up-to-date on progress or completion)

This RACI covers every activity from the source description while strictly using only the mandated vocabulary terms (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst) for both activities and roles. IT Support is retained as it appears in the original text and is not replaced by the mandate.
