In any reachable marking of this Petri net, it is **not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3**. 

**Justification:**

1. **Initial Marking:** The net starts with 1 token in place p0 and no tokens in any other place (p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6 are all 0).

2. **Enabled Transitions:** 
   - **T1** is enabled because it has an input token from p0 (p0 = 1). 
   - **T2** and **T3** are not enabled initially because they require tokens in p1 and p2 respectively, which are both 0.
   - **T4** is not enabled initially because it requires tokens in both p3 and p4, which are also 0.
   - **T5** is not enabled initially because it requires tokens in p4, which is 0.

3. **First Possible Fire:** The only transition that can fire initially is **T1**. 
   - **Firing T1:** Moves 1 token from p0 to p1 and p2, resulting in the marking (0,1,1,0,0,0,0).

4. **Subsequent Enabled Transitions:** After T1 fires:
   - **T2** becomes enabled (now p1 = 1).
   - **T3** remains disabled (p2 is still 1, so T3 cannot fire yet).
   - **T4** becomes enabled (now p3 = 1 and p4 = 0, satisfying the condition for a synchronizing join).
   - **T5** remains disabled (p4 is still 0).

5. **Firing T2 Before T3:** 
   - **Firing T2:** Moves 1 token from p1 to p3, resulting in the marking (0,0,1,1,0,0,0).
   - At this point, **T3** becomes enabled (p2 = 1), allowing it to fire next.

6. **Conclusion:** Since T2 must fire before T3 can fire (as T3 requires a token in p2, which is only produced by T2), T5, which depends on p4 being empty, cannot fire before T3. Therefore, it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking of this Petri net.
