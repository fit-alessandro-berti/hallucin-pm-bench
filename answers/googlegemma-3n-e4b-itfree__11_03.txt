**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** COO, Orion Credit
**FROM:** Orion Credit, Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Process Performance Analysis and Recommendations

This memo details a performance analysis of key Orion Credit activities based on provided data, focusing on SLA adherence and waiting times. Analysis reveals three activities significantly impacting overall process performance.

Specifically, **Legal Approval** exhibits the most substantial SLA breach, with an average waiting time of 600 seconds exceeding the 600-second target. **Credit Assessment** also demonstrates a critical issue, with an average waiting time of 200 seconds falling short of the 240-second target. Finally, **Risk Review** presents a concern, with an average waiting time of 480 seconds exceeding the 300-second target. 

To address these issues, I recommend the following:

*   **Legal Approval:** Implement a process review to identify bottlenecks contributing to the extended waiting time. Given the high waiting time, a reallocation of resources or streamlined approval workflows should be considered.
*   **Credit Assessment:** Investigate the factors driving the 200-second average waiting time, potentially through automation or process optimization to improve throughput.
*   **Risk Review:** Analyze the volume of cases assigned to this activity (480) and explore options to increase throughput or potentially re-evaluate risk assessment criteria to reduce the time required.
