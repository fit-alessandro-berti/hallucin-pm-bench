The fact is **not accurate** with respect to the provided event-log fragment.

**Justification:**
- **Case 1001:** "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02) occurs **after** "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55).
- **Case 1002:** "Update_Inventory" is **missing entirely**, and "Authorize_Refund" (10:18:40) occurs after "Inspect_Item" (10:11:00).
- **Case 1003:** "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18) occurs **after** "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07).

The data show that "Authorize_Refund" does **not** always occur immediately before "Update_Inventory." In fact, the opposite is more common in the given cases.
