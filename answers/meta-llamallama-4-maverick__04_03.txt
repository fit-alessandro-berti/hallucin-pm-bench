**No**

Here's the justification referencing each rule:

1. The trace contains both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) in that order, so Rule 1 is satisfied.

2. Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must occur after both QE and RA. The trace is `..., QE, NA, RA, VP, ...`, so VP occurs after both QE and RA. Thus, Rule 2 is satisfied.

3. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs after QE but **before** RA, violating Rule 3, which requires NA to occur after **both** QE **and** RA.

4. Since Rule 3 is violated, we can conclude non-compliance. However, let's check Rule 4 for completeness. `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after NA and VP, so if NA and VP were correctly ordered, CC would be compliant with Rule 4. However, since NA is incorrectly placed before RA, the overall trace is non-compliant.

The trace violates Rule 3 because `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, making the trace non-compliant with ruleset R.
