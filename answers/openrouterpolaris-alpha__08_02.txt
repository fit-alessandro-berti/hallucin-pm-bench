Q1. No.

Q2. After T1, one token is in P1 and one in P2. To enable T5, we need tokens in P2 and P5. P5 requires T4; T4 requires P4; and P4 can be produced by T3 (from P2) or T7 (from P3) after T2. 

If T3 is not fired, the only way to get P4 is via T2 then T7. But that consumes the P1 branch only; P2’s token remains in P2, so we still need T4 to produce P5. However, T4 consumes P4, leaving no way to satisfy both P2 and P5 simultaneously for T5 without previously firing T3.
