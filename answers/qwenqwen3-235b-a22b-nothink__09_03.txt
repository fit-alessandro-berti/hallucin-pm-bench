The requested metrics cannot be computed from the provided artefacts. The event log stub (Artefact A) contains only column headers but no actual data rows or timestamp values. The SLA information (Artefact B) describes aggregated KPIs (e.g., 7.8 days average between *Approve Invoice* and *Pay Invoice*) but neither individual case durations for *Approve Invoice* nor dispersion metrics like standard deviation or confidence intervals are available. Cycle time calculations require start/complete timestamps per case to compute durations; these data points are explicitly missing from the supplied artefacts.
