Let's analyze the question step by step.

## Restating the Net

### Places (with initial tokens)
p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

### Transitions
- **T1:** p0 → p1 + p2  (*parallel: p0 must have ≥1*)
- **T2:** p1 → p3
- **T3:** p2 → p4
- **T4:** p3 + p4 → p5  (*both must have ≥1 to fire*)
- **T5:** p3 –|p4 → p6  
  - The arrow from p3 is normal (needs p3≥1)
  - The arrow from p4 is inhibitor: T5 fires only if **p4 = 0** (since it's a inhibitor arc from p4; i.e., the arc forbids p4 from enabling the transition if p4≠0)

## Key Observations

- **T5 can only fire if p4 = 0.**
  - Because the inhibitor arc from p4 means T5 is disabled unless p4 has zero tokens.
- **T3 fires by consuming p2, producing p4.**
  - To fire T3, p2 must have at least 1 token. After T3 fires, p4 gets 1 token.
- **T5 requires p4=0 to fire, but T3 must fire before p4 can be reset to 0 (unless something else resets it).**
- T4 produces p5 but doesn't reset any of p3 or p4 (they are just consumed).
- T2 only produces p3, which could in theory be used again if p3 is not consumed elsewhere, but T5 consumes p3.

## Can T5 Fire Before T3?

Let's see if it's possible for T5 to fire before T3.

For T5 to fire **before T3**, we must have T5 enabled **before** T3 can fire, i.e., at some marking reachable from the initial state where T5 is enabled (p3≥1, p4=0) and T3 has not yet fired.

But let's see the dependencies:

- To enable T3, we must first fire T1 (since p2 starts at 0), which splits p0 into p1 and p2.
- To fire T1, we need p0≥1 (which we do initially).
- After T1 fires, both p1 and p2 have 1 token each (assuming they start at 0).
  - Now, p2=1 (so T3 can fire), p4=0 (since no one has fired T3 or T4 yet).
  - p3=0 (since T2 hasn't fired yet).
  - So at this point (after T1), p4=0 but p3=0. Thus, **T5 is not enabled**, since it needs p3≥1.
- The only way to get p3≥1 is by firing T2, which in turn requires p1≥1 (which we have after T1).
- So the earliest T3 can fire is after T1 then T2.
- After T2 fires, p3 becomes 1.
- At that point, p4=0 (since T3 hasn't fired yet), so now T5 **is enabled** (p3=1, p4=0).
- So the **first possible time T5 can fire is after T3 has fired**, because T3 is needed to set p3=1, and T3 can only fire after T1 and then T2.

Is there any way around this? Let's see alternative paths:

- Suppose we try to fire T5 earlier by some other route — but T5 requires p3, which only comes from T2, and T2 only comes from T1 and T2 itself. So you must go through T1 → T2 to get p3.
- There is no way to produce p3 without first producing p2 via T1 (since p2 is only produced by T1), and then p3 via T2.
- T4 does not produce p3, and T1 only produces p2 (not p3).
- So no shortcut.

## Conclusion (Answer)

**No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.**

### Justification

To enable T5, you need p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0. But p3 is only produced by T2, and T2 can only fire after T1 (which produces p2, enabling T3) and after T2 itself (i.e., after T1). Meanwhile, p4 starts at 0 and only becomes 1 after T3 fires. Thus, the first time p3 ≥ 1 is after T3 has fired. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3.

### (If you want a firing sequence where T5 fires after T3, here it is:)
1. **Initial:** (p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0)
2. Fire **T1**: p0→p1+p2 ⇒ (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)
3. Fire **T2**: p1→p3 ⇒ (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)
4. Now T3 is enabled (p2=1). Suppose we fire T3 (though we don't need for this question, but to see the marking after T3):
   - Fire T3: p2→p4 ⇒ (0,0,0,1,1,0,0)
5. Now T4 can fire (p3=1,p4=1) ⇒ (0,0,0,0,0,1,0)
6. Now T5 can fire (p3=0? Wait, after T4 fires p3 is still 1? Wait, T4 consumes p3 and p4 to produce p5. So after T4: p3=0, p4=0, p5=1.
   - So after T4: (0,0,0,0,0,1,0), so p3=0, p4=0 ⇒ T5 is enabled (p3=0? No, T5 needs p3≥1. Wait, mistake here.)

Wait, let's clarify:

After step 4: (p3=1, p4=1). T4 fires consuming both ⇒ p3→0, p4→0, p5→1. So after T4: (p3=0, p4=0).

Now T5 needs p3≥1 to fire. After T4, p3=0, so T5 cannot fire yet. Oops, my earlier thought was wrong.

Let me retrace:

After T1: (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)

After T2: (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)

Now, at this point p3=1, p4=0. So T5 is enabled (p3=1, p4=0). So actually, **at this point, T5 can fire before T3!**

Wait a second, did I make a mistake earlier?

Let me double check:

- T3 is enabled because p2=1 (from T1), but to fire T3 would produce p4=1.
- However, T5 is enabled at the marking (p3=1, p4=0), which is after T1 and T2 but **before T3 has fired**.

So the sequence is:

Initial: (1,0,0,0,0,0,0)

1. Fire T1: p0→p1+p2 ⇒ (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)
   - Now p3=0, p4=0, p1=1, p2=1

2. Fire T2: p1→p3 ⇒ (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)
   - Now p3=1, p4=0

At this point, T5 can fire because p3=1 and p4=0. T3 can also fire (p2=1). So depending on the order, you could fire T5 before T3.

Therefore, it **is possible** for T5 to fire before T3, as long as you choose to fire T2 before T3.

### Firing sequence to have T5 fire before T3:

1. Initial: (1,0,0,0,0,0,0)
2. Fire T1: (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)
3. Fire T2: (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)
   - Now T5 is enabled (p3=1, p4=0). So fire T5 now:
4. Fire T5: p3→p6 (and inhibitor arc is respected since p4=0) ⇒ (0,0,1,0,0,0,1)

Thus, T5 fires before T3 (which could be fired next by firing T3: p2→p4).

### Justification

After firing T1 and T2, the marking allows T5 to fire (because p3=1 and p4=0), even though T3 is still possible to fire (since p2=1). The net allows concurrent choices; you can fire T5 before T3 as long as you respect the enabling conditions at that state.

## Final Answer

**Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3.**

**Example firing sequence:**

1. Initial: (p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0)
2. Fire T1: p0→p1+p2 → (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)
3. Fire T2: p1→p3 → (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)
4. Now T5 is enabled (p3=1, p4=0). Fire T5: p3→p6 → (0,0,1,0,0,0,1)

At this point, T5 has fired before T3 (which could still be fired if desired).

**Reason:** After T1 and T2, the marking allows T5 to fire immediately because p3=1 and p4=0, even though T3 is also enabled. The inhibitor on T5 only forbids firing if p4>0, but p4 remains 0 until T3 is fired. Thus, T5 can be scheduled before T3.
