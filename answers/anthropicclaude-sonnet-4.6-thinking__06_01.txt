**Process B parallel pairs:**

`Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check`
`Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`

---

**Reasoning (Process B only):**

| Step | Parallel group |
|------|----------------|
| Step 2 | **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** are explicitly stated to run simultaneously. → 1 pair |
| Step 4 | **Quality_Check** and **Create_Documentation** are explicitly stated to run in parallel. → 1 pair |

No cross-group parallelism exists: Fabricate is a synchronisation point that must complete before the second parallel group begins, so tasks from the two groups never overlap.
