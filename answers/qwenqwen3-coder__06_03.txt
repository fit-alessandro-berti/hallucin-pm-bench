Looking at Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment, I can identify the following sets of tasks that execute concurrently:

**Set 1:**
• Quality_Check
• Update_Inventory

**Set 2:**
• Generate_Replenishment_Report
• Notify_Procurement

These sets represent the tasks that lie on different branches of the same parallel constructs - the first set executes concurrently after the first parallel split, and the second set executes concurrently after the second parallel split.
