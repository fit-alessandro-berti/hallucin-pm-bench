   *   **Time Span Limitation:** The log fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01), which is insufficient to represent the variability or seasonality of a full month.
   *   **Small Sample Size:** The fragment contains only 18 total events; a sample this small results in high statistical variance, making a single occurrence disproportionately influential on the estimated frequency.
