Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Worst Performers and Actions

Worst-performing activities:

1) Request_Documents
- Why: Severe throughput drop (190 vs ~270 upstream), extreme queueing (avg wait 150 min), very high rework (22.0%), and elevated SLA breaches (5.5%). This is the dominant bottleneck and rework driver.
- Action: Introduce a standardized document checklist and upfront digital intake validation; track rework rate weekly with target <10% and monitor queue time reduction from 150→60 minutes.

2) Review_Documents
- Why: High processing time (25 min) with high variability (stdev 9), notable queueing (30 min), and high SLA breach rate (12.4%). Likely inconsistent review practices.
- Action: Implement review guidelines and a two-tier triage (simple vs complex) with workload balancing; aim to cut stdev from 9→5 and SLA breaches from 12.4%→6%.

3) Initial_Assessment
- Why: Elevated wait (18 min) and processing time (12 min) compared to peers; higher SLA breaches (3.2%). Throughput drops from 280 to 270, indicating early-stage friction.
- Action: Add skill-based routing and template-driven assessment; target reducing processing time from 12→9 min and wait from 18→10 min, tracking SLA breach improvement.
