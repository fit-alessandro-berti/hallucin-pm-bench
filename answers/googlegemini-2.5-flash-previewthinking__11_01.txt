Subject: Performance Insights: Top 3 Waiting Time Bottlenecks

Analysis of claims processing data identifies key bottlenecks based on average waiting times:

1.  **Request_Documents:** Avg 36.5h (95p 120.0h).
    *   *Action:* Implement automated follow-ups for pending documents to reduce external dependencies and waiting by over 20%.
2.  **Send_Closure_Letter:** Avg 12.2h (95p 44.0h).
    *   *Action:* Automate closure letter generation and dispatch post-decision to cut waiting time by over 20%.
3.  **Assess_Liability:** Avg 7.8h (95p 16.4h).
    *   *Action:* Introduce dynamic work queue management to minimize idle time before assessment by over 20%.

Prioritizing these efforts offers significant potential for improving overall claims speed.
