Implement a **Timer Event** attached to the sequence flow **f2** (`Task_Receive` to `Task_Check`) or directly on **Task_Receive** itself, configured with a boundary event on the flow from **Task_Receive** to **Task_Check**.

Set the timer duration to **48 hours**. If the timer boundary fires, the compensating path should bypass **Task_Check** and connect directly to **Task_Triage** (ID: `Task_Triage`), effectively auto-escalating the claim. This meets the 48-hour SLA requirement without adding new tasks.
