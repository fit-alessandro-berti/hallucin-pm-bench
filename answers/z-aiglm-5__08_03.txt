**Yes**, it is possible.

### Shortest Firing Sequence
One of the shortest firing sequences is:
**T1 $\rightarrow$ T4 $\rightarrow$ T2b $\rightarrow$ T5**

(Alternative equivalent sequence: **T1 $\rightarrow$ T2b $\rightarrow$ T4 $\rightarrow$ T5**)

### Explanation
1.  **T1 fires**: Consumes `p0` and produces tokens in `pa` and `pb`.
    *   Marking: $\{pa=1, pb=1\}$
2.  **T4 fires**: Consumes `pb` and produces `pe`.
    *   Marking: $\{pa=1, pe=1\}$
    *   This satisfies one of the pre-conditions for T5 (`pe`).
3.  **T2b fires**: Consumes `pa` and produces `pd`.
    *   Marking: $\{pd=1, pe=1\}$
    *   This satisfies the second pre-condition for T5 (`pd`).
    *   Crucially, T2b is a "shortcut" transition that produces `pd` without placing a token in `pc`. Therefore, transition **T3** (which requires `pc` as input) is not enabled and has not fired.
4.  **T5 fires**: Consumes `pd` and `pe` and produces `pf`.
    *   T5 has successfully fired before T3.
