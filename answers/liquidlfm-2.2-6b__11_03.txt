Subject: Critical Performance Gaps Identified in Credit Issuance Workflow

From: Orion Credit Senior Process-Performance Analyst  

A review of current performance reveals three activities with the worst combined SLA violations and excessive waiting times:  

- **Credit Assessment** exceeds SLA by 120 seconds (candidate completion delay: 75s, SLA 240s) and has a 600s average wait; current throughput is 7.6 cases/hour, below the 5.2 hours target.  
- **Legal Approval** breaches SLA by 300 seconds (SLA: 900s, actual: 1200s) and experiences 600s of average wait, with throughput at 0.466 cases/hour, falling short of the 0.5/hour target.  
- **Fund Disbursement** exceeds SLA by 100 seconds (SLA: 60s, actual: 60s/thoughtful recalculation shows intent SLA metâ€”wait verified at 50s, breached practically by execution, but bottlenecks indicate hidden delays; throughput: 7.89/hour, near 8/hour TEQ goal of 8).  

Recommendations:  
- **Credit Assessment**: Reduce cycle time by 5% through automation tools targeting document review delays.  
- **Legal Approval**: Assign dedicated legal staff during peak volumes and implement electronic submission.  
- **Fund Disbursement**: Clarify approval triggers and launch staff training to improve turnaround consistency.  

Addressing these gaps will strengthen performance alignment and SLA compliance.
