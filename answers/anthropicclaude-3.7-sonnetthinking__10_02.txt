# AtlasRemit Cross-Border Payment RACI Matrix

I've analyzed the process description and created a RACI matrix for AtlasRemit's cross-border payment service, using only the mandated vocabulary terms.

## RACI Matrix

| Activity | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Receive and log transfer instruction | R/A | | |
| Screen payment against sanctions list | R/A | | |
| Perform KYC Review | | R/A | |
| Approve high-risk transactions | I | R/A | |
| Release payment | R/A | I | |
| Ensure SWIFT message is sent | I | | R/A |
| Archive case file | | I | R/A |

**Legend:**
- R: Responsible (performs the work)
- A: Accountable (ultimate authority)
- C: Consulted (provides input)
- I: Informed (kept updated)

This matrix clearly identifies roles and responsibilities throughout AtlasRemit's payment processing workflow, from initial instruction receipt through final archiving, using the organization's standard terminology.
