Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance

Based on the data, the three weakest activities are:

1) Request_Documents – This step suffers from the longest wait time (150 minutes), highest rework (22%), and a 5.5% SLA breach. The excessive queueing indicates bottlenecks before document collection even begins. To address this, establish an automated document-request portal to reduce manual follow-ups and minimize rework.

2) Review_Documents – With a 25-minute average processing time, a 9-minute variability, and the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), this activity significantly delays overall throughput. Introducing structured review guidelines—supported by targeted staff training or AI-based document checks—will help standardize processing and lower variability.

3) Initial_Assessment – Although its throughput is relatively high, the 12-minute execution time and 3.2% SLA breach identify improvement opportunities. Incorporate standardized checklists in the assessment tool to shorten review durations and reduce errors.

These measures focus on the most critical data indicators—excessive wait times, long processing durations, and high rework or SLA breaches—to improve process flow and customer satisfaction.
