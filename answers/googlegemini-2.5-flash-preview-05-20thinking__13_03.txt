1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst relying solely on this snippet would misestimate the commonality of "Manual Fraud Check" in the full month-long log due to the **small sample size** and **limited temporal scope** of the provided data. This excerpt covers only three cases and a few hours from a single day, which is highly unlikely to be statistically representative of an entire month's worth of loan processes. The observed frequency (one occurrence) could be an anomaly, either higher or lower than the true average across thousands of cases in the full log, leading to a biased perception of how common this activity genuinely is.
