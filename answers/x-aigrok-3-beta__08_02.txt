**Question 1:** No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

**Question 2 (bonus):** T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5 to fire. P5 gets a token only after T4 fires, which requires a token in P4. P4, in turn, gets a token from T3 (or T7), meaning T3 must fire before P4 can enable T4. Thus, T3 must always fire before T5 to contribute to enabling T5 via P4 and P5. No firing sequence can reverse this dependency, as the structure enforces T3’s firing prior to T5’s enablement. Hence, no such sequence exists.
