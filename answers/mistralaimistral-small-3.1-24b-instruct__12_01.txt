The fact is **not accurate** with respect to the event-log fragment. The claim states that the activity "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case. However, the data shows otherwise:

- **Case 1001**: The activities are in the following order:
  1. Receive_Return
  2. Inspect_Item
  3. **Update_Inventory**
  4. **Authorize_Refund**
  5. Refund_Issued

  Here, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund".

- **Case 1002**: The activities are in the following order:
  1. Receive_Return
  2. Inspect_Item
  3. Authorize_Refund
  4. Refund_Issued

  "Update_Inventory" does not appear in this case.

- **Case 1003**: The activities are in the following order:
  1. Receive_Return
  2. Inspect_Item
  3. **Update_Inventory**
  4. Quality_Check
  5. **Authorize_Refund**

  Here, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund".

In all cases where both "Authorize_Refund" and "Update_Inventory" appear, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund". Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.
