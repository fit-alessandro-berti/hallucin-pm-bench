**No.**

The claim is incorrect because there are instances where *Validate_Payment* does not follow *Receive_Order*. For example, in case C003 (lines 6 and 7), *Validate_Payment* occurs before *Receive_Order*. Additionally, in case C005 (lines 11 and 12), *Validate_Payment* occurs before *Cancel_Order* without any prior *Receive_Order* event. These examples demonstrate that *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* in the log.
