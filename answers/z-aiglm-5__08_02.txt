**Answer to Question 1:**  
Yes.

**Answer to Question 2 (bonus):**  
**Minimal firing sequence:** T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

**Explanation:**  
Transition T1 creates tokens in P1 and P2. Although T3 is enabled by P2, we avoid firing it. Instead, we execute the sequence T2, T7, and T4. This path moves the token from P1 to P5 via P3 and P4. This results in the marking {P2, P5}. With tokens in both P2 and P5, T5 is enabled. Firing T5 consumes the token in P2, achieving the goal before T3 ever fires.
