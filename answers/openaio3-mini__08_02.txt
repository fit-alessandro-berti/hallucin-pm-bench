Answer 1: Yes.

Answer 2: After T1 fires, P2 still holds its token. One minimal firing sequence is: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. 

Explanation:
• T1 (AND‐split) yields tokens in P1 and P2.
• T2, followed by T7, moves the token from P1 to P4.
• T4 then moves the token from P4 to P5.
At this stage, P2 (untouched) and P5 each have one token. These enable T5, which can fire before T3 ever consumes the token from P2.
