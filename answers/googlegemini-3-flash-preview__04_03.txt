**No**

Trace 2025-05-RX17 is **non-compliant**. Here is the rule-by-rule evaluation:

*   **Rule 1 (Violation):** The rule requires `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) to occur in that specific order. While both occurred once, the trace shows `Notify_Authorities` was performed **between** them, and more critically, RA was performed after QE (satisfied) but **after** authority notification (violating the sequence required for subsequent rules).
*   **Rule 2 (Satisfied):** Since severity is "High," `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen after both QE and RA. In this trace, VP occurred after both reviews.
*   **Rule 3 (Violation):** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until **after** both QE and RA are complete. In this trace, NA occurred *before* the `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` was conducted.
*   **Rule 4 (Satisfied):** `Close_Case` (CC) occurred after both NA and VP, which is the correct positioning for a High-severity case.

**Summary:** The trace failed because the authorities were notified before the Regulatory Affairs Review was completed, breaking the mandatory internal review sequence.
