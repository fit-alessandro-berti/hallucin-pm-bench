Question 1  
Yes.  A token for P5 can be generated through the left‐hand branch (P1→P3→P4→P5) while the original token in P2 is still present; T5 can then fire using {P2,P5} before T3 has touched P2.

Question 2 (minimal demonstration)  
T1, T2, T7, T4, T5  

After each step  
1.  T1:  P1 + P2  
2.  T2:  P3 + P2  
3.  T7:  P4 + P2  
4.  T4:  P5 + P2   (T5 now enabled, T3 also enabled but unfired)  
5.  T5:  P6            (P2 is consumed; T3 can no longer occur)

Thus T5 fires strictly before any occurrence of T3.
