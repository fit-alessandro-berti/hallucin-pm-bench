Given the artefacts provided:

1. For the **average cycle time** of activity "Approve Invoice", we cannot compute this metric because the actual timestamps (`start_time` and `complete_time`) are redacted in the event-log stub. Cycle time is calculated as the difference between these timestamps for each instance of the activity. Without the raw data values, the average cannot be derived.

2. For similar reasons, we cannot compute the **standard deviation** or a **95% confidence interval**, as these require individual cycle time measurements to calculate variance and inferential statistics.

3. The core limitation is that the provided artefacts lack actual **raw data values** for the critical columns (`start_time`, `complete_time`) and omit details about the number of observations. Artefact B contains only summary/KPI data from historical averages (2023), which cannot be used to compute metrics for the redacted log. Process mining requires concrete event-level inputs to calculate these metrics; aggregates or redactions prevent precise analysis.

In summary, no metrics can be computed from the given artefacts because the required granular event data is missing.

*(Note: Theoretical inferences or guesses—e.g., borrowing historical averages from Artefact B—would be statistically invalid and were not performed due to the strict restriction against assumptions.)*
