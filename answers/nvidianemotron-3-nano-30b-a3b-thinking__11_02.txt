**From:** Senior Process‑Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Top‑3 Under‑Performing Claim Activities & Targeted Actions  
**Date:** 2 Nov 2025  

| Rank | Activity | Why it under‑performs (table‑based) |
|------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Review Documents** | SLA breach 12.4 % – the highest of all steps; avg processing time 25 min and rework 5.3 % indicate repeated effort. |
| 2 | **Request Documents** | Avg wait 150 min (far above the 4‑30 min range of peers) and rework 22 % (the worst) drive a 5.5 % SLA breach, severely limiting throughput (190 cases/day). |
| 3 | **Initial Assessment** | Wait 18 min and SLA breach 3.2 % are the next‑largest after the two above; throughput (270 cases/day) is solid but the delay inflates overall cycle time. |

**Recommended actions (data‑driven):**  

1. **Review Documents:** Deploy a standardized checklist and automatable validation script to cut average processing time by ~30 % (target ≤ 18 min) and reduce rework to ≤ 2 %.  
2. **Request Documents:** Introduce a self‑service document‑capture portal to halve the current 150‑min queue, aiming for ≤ 70 min wait and rework down to ≤ 10 %.  
3. **Initial Assessment:** Add one analyst shift during peak periods to bring average wait time under 5 min, cutting SLA breach to ≤ 1 %.  

These focused improvements are projected to lower overall claim‑cycle SLA breach by roughly 4 percentage points within the next quarter.
