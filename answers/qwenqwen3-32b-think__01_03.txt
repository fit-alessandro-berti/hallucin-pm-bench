*Notes:*  
- The **Deck Memo** is used in Step 5 (Manual Underwriting), but its first explicit mention occurs in Step 5.  
- The **Signed Offer Sheet** is a modified version of **Offer Sheet 77** (Step 7), mentioned again in Step 8.  
- The **ID Matrix Declaration** is introduced in Step 8.  
- KYC/AML checks are excluded as per the system note.  
- The **Sustainability Officer** is a role, not a document, so it does not appear here.
