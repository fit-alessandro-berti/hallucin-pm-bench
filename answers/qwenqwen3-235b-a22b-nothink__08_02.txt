**Question 1.** Yes, T5 can fire before T3.  
**Question 2.** Minimal firing sequence:  
T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5.  

**Explanation**  
After firing T1, P2 has a token. Firing T2 then T7 populates P4, which enables T4 to mark P5. Since P2 and P5 are both marked, T5 fires directly without needing T3. T5 consumes P2 and P5 to mark P6. This sequence confirms T5 fires before T3 becomes possible.
