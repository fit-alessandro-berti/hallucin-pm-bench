**1.** The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time** (in case C05).  

**2.**  
a) Percentage of all events: **2.08%**  
*(Calculation: 1 event / 48 total events = 0.020833 → 2.08% rounded)*  
b) Percentage of unique cases: **8.33%**  
*(Calculation: 1 case / 12 total cases = 0.083333 → 8.33% rounded)*  

**3.**  
With only one occurrence (1 event, 1 case), "Manual_Fraud_Check" lacks statistical reliability. Performance metrics (e.g., duration averages) become skewed by single outliers, while predictive models may falsely associate it with outcomes (e.g., approval in C05) due to overfitting. Generalizing from this slice misrepresents process behavior, as rare activities like this—absent in 11/12 cases—distort flow patterns and risk assessment accuracy when scaled to the full process. *(79 words)*
