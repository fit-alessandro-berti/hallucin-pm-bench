Executive Memo: Critical Process Performance Analysis

To: Chief Operating Officer
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst
Date: [Current Date]
Subject: Three Worst-Performing Activities Requiring Immediate Attention

Our process analysis reveals three activities that significantly underperform due to combined SLA breaches and excessive waiting times:

**Risk Review** breaches its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with an average waiting time of 480 seconds across 480 cases. The extended wait time indicates a capacity bottleneck that directly impacts customer experience and processing velocity.

**Legal Approval** shows a 300-second SLA breach (900 seconds actual vs. 600-second target) with the highest waiting time at 600 seconds. This delay cascades through the remaining process stages and affects 465 cases.

**Credit Assessment** exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds and has a substantial 200-second waiting time across 1,175 cases. This early-stage bottleneck compounds downstream delays.

Recommendations:
• Risk Review: Implement tiered risk-scoring to automatically route lower-risk applications, reducing manual reviewer workload.
• Legal Approval: Create pre-approved templates for standard loan structures to accelerate legal review cycles.
• Credit Assessment: Deploy automated credit-scoring algorithms to reduce manual assessment time and waiting periods.
