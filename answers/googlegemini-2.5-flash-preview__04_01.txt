Non-compliant

1.  Rule 2 states that if the trace contains `Expedite_Flag`, `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In Trace 24-EXP, `Expedite_Flag` is present (event #4), but `Risk_Assessment` (event #9) occurs after `Ship_Goods` (event #8).
2.  Rule 4 states that no activity executed by the role **Intern** may **directly follow** an activity executed by the role **CFO**. In Trace 24-EXP, activity `Move_to_Quality` (event #7, role Intern) directly follows activity `Goods_Received` (event #6, role Warehouse_Clerk). This transition does not violate Rule 4 as the preceding activity was not executed by the CFO.
3.  Rule 5 states the trace must finish with `Archive_Record` and contain nothing after it. Trace 24-EXP finishes with `Archive_Record` (event #11) and has no activities after it. This rule is respected.
4.  Rule 1 states that any PO whose total amount exceeds €10 000 must obtain two approvals, first by a Procurement Officer and then by the CFO, before activity `Issue_PO`. The `PO_Amount` is €12 300. Approvals by `Procurement_Officer` (event #2) and `CFO` (event #3) both occur before `Issue_PO` (event #5). This rule is respected.
5.  Rule 3 states that after `Goods_Received`, activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). `Goods_Received` is event #6. `Move_to_Quality` is event #7 (distance 1). `Ship_Goods` is event #8 (distance 2). `Three_way_match` is event #10 (distance 4). This rule is violated.

Therefore, the trace is non-compliant due to violations of Rules 2 and 3.
