Yes. The activity *Validate_Payment* (event IDs 5, 6, 11) consistently follows *Receive_Order* (event IDs 1, 3, 7, 8) in the log fragment, with no instance of *Validate_Payment* occurring before any *Receive_Order*. For example, *Receive_Order* is first at 08:15 and 10:43, while *Validate_Payment* only appears at 09:02–09:07, 09:07 (after 04), 10:05–10:07 (after 08), and 11:25, all after corresponding *Receive_Order* events. This confirms *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order* as claimed.
