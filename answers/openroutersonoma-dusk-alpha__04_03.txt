**Rule 1 (violated):** QE and RA must occur once each and in that order (QE before RA). In the trace, QE occurs at position 3, but RA occurs later at position 5â€”out of order.

**Rule 2 (violated due to Rule 1):** With severity="High", VP must occur after both QE and RA. VP is at position 6, but RA precedes it only after QE is already complete; however, the ordering violation of Rule 1 invalidates the prerequisite for this rule.

**Rule 3 (violated):** NA must occur after both QE and RA are complete. NA is at position 4, before RA at position 5.

**Rule 4 (satisfied):** CC is at position 7, after NA (position 4) and VP (position 6, required due to high severity).
