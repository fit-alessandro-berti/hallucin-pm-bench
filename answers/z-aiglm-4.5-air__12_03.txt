**Answer:** No  

**Justification:**  
The FACT claims that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between. However, the event log excerpt reveals two cases where this sequence is violated:  

- **Case C002**:  
  - Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment`  
  - After "Receive_Order" (at 09:30), the next activity is `Pack_Items` (at 09:50), followed by `Validate_Payment` (at 10:05). Thus, an activity (`Pack_Items`) occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment."  

- **Case C004**:  
  - Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment`  
  - After "Receive_Order" (at 10:05), the next activity is `Check_Fraud` (at 10:07), followed by `Validate_Payment` (at 10:20). Here, `Check_Fraud` interrupts the claimed sequence.  

While Cases C001 and C003 exhibit the immediate sequence (`Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment`), the presence of intervening activities in Cases C002 and C004 disproves the universal claim. The FACT is therefore **inaccurate** with respect to the log excerpt.
