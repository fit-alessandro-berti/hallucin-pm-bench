Add an intermediate timer event after "Start_Claim" to monitor the 48-hour SLA. Attach a timer event (non-interrupting) to "Task_Triage" with a duration of 48 hours, starting from "Start_Claim". If the timer fires before "Task_Triage" is reached, route to an escalation task (reusing existing tasks via conditional logic or notifications). However, since no new tasks can be added, redirect the timer flow to "Task_Notify" with an escalation flag via condition on sequence flow to alert supervisors, ensuring visibility without violating constraints. This uses existing elements and ensures timely intervention. Reference: Start_Claim, Task_Triage, Task_Notify.
