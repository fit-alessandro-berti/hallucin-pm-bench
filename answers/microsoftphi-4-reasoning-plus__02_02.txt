We are given an fragment of an XES event log and questions. We'll answer questions one by one. Given event log details.

We are given 10 lines. They are event logs as provided with standard XES attributes containing case id "C001", "C002", "C001", "C003", "C002", "C003", "C001", "C002", "C003", "C002". So we need unique event logs (distinct cases). Actually Q1: "How many **distinct cases** are present?" So we consider case attribute group. Which ones present? They are: C001, C002, C003. So distinct cases: 3. Count = 3.

Wait, note: In events we see each event line: event line "C001", "C002", "C001", "C003", "C002", "C003", "C001", "C002", "C003", "C002". So distinct cases: "C001", "C002", "C003", total count=3.

Q2: "For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as separator)."

For case "C002", events: Which one line has type prefix with case "C002"? Inspect: line 2 "Receive_Order", line 5 "Check_Stock", line 8 "Arrange_Delivery", line 10 "Ship_Order". Also is that all in that order? Check: line 2: Receive_Order, then line 5: Check_Stock, then line 8: Arrange_Delivery, then line 10: Ship_Order. But wait, line 8 is for_receive? Wait, Check contents: Let me check quickly:

- "C001" cases: 
  event line 1: Receive_Order in C001, event line 3: Check_Stock in C001, event line 7: Ship_Order in C001.
- "C002" cases: 
  event line 2: Receive_Order, event line 5: Check_Stock, event line 8: Arrange_Delivery, event line 10: Ship_Order.
- "C003" cases: 
  event line 4: Receive_Order, event line 6: Check_Stock, event line 9: Ship_Order

So yes, answer for Q2: For case C002, the events are, in order: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order. So answer Q2: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order".

Q3: "Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered)." That means: In the entire event log, which events appear immediately before an occurrence of the event “Ship_Order”, and then output distinct activity names preceding each "Ship_Order" event across all cases. We must consider each occurrence of "Ship_Order" in each case and pick the activity that immediately occurred right before it in that same case. So we must parse each trace "case id" separately and find the last event preceding "Ship_Order" if there is one.

Case C001: events: line1: Receive_Order, line3: Check_Stock, line7: Ship_Order.
The immediate previous event for "Ship_Order" is "Check_Stock" since the events in order: Receive_Order, Check_Stock, Ship_Order. So for C001, events that precede "Ship_Order" is "Check_Stock"? Or maybe line itself. But check: In a trace, if an event is at the beginning, then then there is no event preceding it. But here we check occurrences of "Ship_Order"? So in C001, one occurrence of "Ship_Order" exists and the preceding event is "Check_Stock". So "Check_Stock" is recorded.

Case C002: events: line2: Receive_Order, line5: Check_Stock, line8: Arrange_Delivery, line10: Ship_Order.
For the “Ship_Order” event of case C002, we check: The preceding event preceding the last event "Ship_Order"? In the trace, which line is it? For case C002, events (sort positions by timestamp but sequence order): Receive_Order (line2), then Check_Stock (line5), then Arrange_Delivery (line8) then finally Ship_Order (line10). So immediate preceding event is "Arrange_Delivery". So add "Arrange_Delivery" to the list.

Case C003: events: line4: Receive_Order, line6: Check_Stock, line9: Ship_Order.
The preceding event for "Ship_Order" is "Check_Stock" in case C003.

So list distinct acts that come immediately before "Ship_Order" across all cases are from the events: "Check_Stock" (from C001 and C003) and "Arrange_Delivery" (from C002). So distinct activity names are: "Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock". But requirement: "list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”" across all cases. But question said output each distinct activity name in alphabetical order, one per line.

Wait, details: "list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered)". Alphabetically, "Arrange_Delivery" comes before "Check_Stock" since "Arrange_Delivery" (first letter A) comes before "Check_Stock" (letter C). But check it: alphabetical order "Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock". But wait, check: alphabetical ordering when names, first letter, A vs C, so then "Arrange_Delivery" < "Check_Stock". But then maybe ordering is alphabetical order? So one line: "Arrange_Delivery", next line: "Check_Stock". Should we consider events in continuing event log ordering? But the text says "alphabetically ordered", so I must list "Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock". But wait, the order as separate lines: "Arrange_Delivery" then on the next line "Check_Stock". However, the phrase "list every distinct activity" in each separate case that immediately precedes Ship_Order. It's "precedes", does not need overall ordering. But yes, then answer Q3: distinct preceding activities are "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" and arranged alphabetically so "Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock". However, it says one per line.

Now I'll produce answer Q1: 3 distinct cases are present, Q2: For case C002: sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order, Q3: list pretty each distinct activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order":
For C001: preceding event "Check_Stock"
For C002: preceding event "Arrange_Delivery"
For C003: preceding event "Check_Stock"
Distinct => {"Check_Stock", "Arrange_Delivery"}.
Alphabetical order: "Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock".
However, the question uses "immediately precedes" so no repetition in C001 vs C003, so only unique activities that have come before a "Ship_Order" occurrence are: Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock. But in alphabetical order: 
Actually alphabetical order: "Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock" letter order: 'A'=Alpha, then letter 'C'.
I must check if "Receive_Order" come anywhere that immediately precedes "Ship_Order"? Not in C002 because it is "Arrange_Delivery", no, C001 and C003 all have "Check_Stock".
Yes. So answer Q3: "Arrange_Delivery", then on separate line "Check_Stock". 
We done.

I provide answer details Q1: "There are 3 distinct cases: C001, C002, and C003."
Q2: "Case C002's sequence is: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order."
Q3: "Across all cases, the activity immediately preceding Ship_Order are: Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock. In alphabetical order, they are: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock."

I double-check input conditions.
Input fragment exactly 10 lines, ensure each line triggered output is consistent. Yes.

I produce answer. Warning: You must abide by default preformat instructions: "exactly one line per answer" with correct separation?
The question says "three Q's Q1, Q2, Q3." I'm to produce results. Possibly also snippet details. I'll produce plain text as needed.

I'll produce answer: Q1: 3, Q2: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order, Q3: 
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
And produce space. I'll produce answer message in plain text as instruction.

I'll produce answer message in plain text.

I'll produce answer messages with no markdown unless asked, so plain text with bullets maybe text lines.

I'll produce answer message in plain text with no markdown formatting. This will be a plain text answer as final answer.

I'll produce answer message as final answer message in plain text therefore as text message.

I'll produce answer message as final answer message in plain text sure.

I'll produce answer message in final answer message as text.

I'll produce answer final answer message accordingly.

I'll produce answer next.Q1. There are 3 distinct cases: C001, C002, and C003.

Q2. For case “C002”, the activities occur in the following order:  
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

Q3. Looking at each case, the activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” is:  
• In C001: Check_Stock  
• In C002: Arrange_Delivery  
• In C003: Check_Stock  
Removing duplicates and listing alphabetically gives:  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
