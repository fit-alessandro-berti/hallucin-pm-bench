Decision points  
1. Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility – accept/reject the claim.  
2. Finance_Controller_PreApprove – sign-off or decline.  
3. High-value check – if refund > €1 000 the case goes to Senior_Auditor_Review; otherwise it skips that step.  
4. Senior_Auditor_Review – pass/fail for high-value claims only.
