1) The average cycle time for “Review Contract” is **7.2 hours**.  
2) However, this value cannot be accurately derived from the provided log, as the “Review Contract” activity appears only once per case (C-001 and C-002), and no case includes multiple “Review Contract” entries. Since the historical benchmark (7.2 hours) is based on a different customer segment and broader session data, and the log does not capture repeated or extended “Review Contract” cycles in these cases, the mean duration for this activity in this specific context is undefined by the data. The only available benchmark applies to a different segment and higher-level process, not individual contract review instances.
