Yes. One shortest firing sequence that fires T5 before T3 is:

T1, T2b, T4, T5

Proof / markings:
- Start: p0=1 (others 0).
- After T1: pa=1, pb=1.
- After T2b: pd=1, pa=0, pb=1. (pd created without ever producing pc, so T3 has not fired and cannot have fired)
- After T4: pe=1, pb=0, pd=1.
- Now T5 is enabled and can fire (consumes pd and pe). T3 has not occurred in this prefix.

Minimality argument:
- To fire T5 you need tokens in pd and pe.
- pe can only be produced by T4, and T4 requires pb which is produced only by T1; so T1 and T4 must both occur before T5.
- pd can be produced either by T3 or T2b. But T3 requires pc, which requires T2 or T6. T6 requires pf which in turn requires T5, so using T3 before T5 would need T2 (which itself needs T1) and would add extra transitions. Therefore the shortest way to get pd before T5 is via T2b.
- Hence the shortest prefix enabling T5 is T1 (to get pb and pa), T2b (to get pd), T4 (to get pe), then T5 â€” exactly the 4-transition sequence given above.
