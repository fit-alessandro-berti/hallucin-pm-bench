Dear COO,  

Three activities show the most severe combined performance issues when measured against both SLA compliance and waiting time contribution:  

- **Legal Approval**: Avg throughput time 900 s (exceeds Target SLA by 300 s); avg waiting time 600 s.  
- **Risk Review**: Avg throughput time 600 s (exceeds Target SLA by 300 s); avg waiting time 480 s; only 480 of 1200 cases reach this step.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Avg throughput time 300 s (exceeds Target SLA by 60 s); avg waiting time 200 s; affects 1175 cases.  

Recommended actions:  
- Legal Approval: Increase parallel routing or dedicated resources, as waiting time (600 s) represents 67% of total throughput and drives the largest absolute SLA breach.  
- Risk Review: Expand risk reviewer capacity immediately, given the joint highest SLA overrun (300 s) and 480 s waiting time on a volume-sensitive step.  
- Credit Assessment: Implement workload balancing or automation triggers to reduce 200 s waiting time, preventing the 60 s SLA breach from propagating to 98% of cases.  

Prompt intervention on these activities will yield the highest impact on end-to-end SLA compliance.
