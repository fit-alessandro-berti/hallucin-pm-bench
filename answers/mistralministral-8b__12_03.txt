No.

The FACT is not accurate. The event log excerpt provides the following sequences:

- **CaseID C001**: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items
- **CaseID C002**: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment
- **CaseID C003**: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order
- **CaseID C004**: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items

From these sequences, it is clear that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order" without any other activities in between. For example, in CaseID C002, "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment."
