   Answer: 5.56%

3. The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is: A1002

4. Two sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly manual fraud checks from this fragment is unreliable:
   - The sample size is too small (only 18 events across 4 cases), which limits statistical validity.
   - The sample may not be representative of the entire month's activity, as it only includes a portion of data from a single day (May 1, 2025).
