## Manual_Fraud_Check Activity Analysis

1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt.

2. Percentage calculations:
   a) Percentage of all events: 1/48 = **2.08%**
   b) Percentage of all unique cases: 1/12 = **8.33%**

3. **Why low-support activities can mislead analyses:**
   Low-support activities like Manual_Fraud_Check (occurring in only 8.33% of cases) provide insufficient data points for reliable statistical conclusions. This creates sampling bias when generalizing to the full process. Performance metrics or predictive models built on such rare activities may produce high variance results that don't represent typical process behavior. The rarity makes it difficult to distinguish between genuine process patterns and random variations, potentially leading to overfitting in predictive models.
