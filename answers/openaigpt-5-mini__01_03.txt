a) Decision points (one-sentence rules)
1. Tri-Color-Risk-Check: the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) produce a risk rating of Low/Medium/High, and if the rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is ≤ €250,000 then the Manual-Underwriting-Review is skipped, otherwise Manual-Underwriting-Review is required.  
2. Decision-Gate “TriVote”: the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer must all participate (Sustainability Officer participation is mandatory), and the loan passes this gate if any two of the three approve.  
3. Applicant confirmation before finalization: Finalize-Agreement is only performed after the applicant returns the required signed documents (Signed Offer Sheet 77 and the ID Matrix Declaration).
