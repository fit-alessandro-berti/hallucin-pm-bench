Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking. This occurs because there exists a reachable marking where T5 is enabled (due to tokens in pd and pe) while T3 is not enabled (due to the absence of a token in pc). Specifically, in a state where pc has no token, T3 cannot fire, allowing T5 to fire before T3 in the firing sequence.
### Shortest Firing Sequence
The shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3 consists of 4 transitions:
1. **T1**: Fires from initial marking, consuming p0 and producing pa and pb.  
   - New marking: p0=0, pa=1, pb=1, all others=0.
2. **T2b**: Fires from the new marking, consuming pa and producing pd.  
   - New marking: p0=0, pa=0, pb=1, pd=1, all others=0.
3. **T4**: Fires from the new marking, consuming pb and producing pe.  
   - New marking: p0=0, pa=0, pb=0, pd=1, pe=1, all others=0.
4. **T5**: Fires from the new marking, consuming pd and pe and producing pf.  
   - New marking: p0=0, pa=0, pb=0, pd=0, pe=0, pf=1, pc=0.
In this sequence:
- T5 fires after T1, T2b, and T4, and at the time of T5's firing, pc has no token, so T3 is not enabled.
- The sequence has 4 transitions, which is the minimum possible, as T1 must fire first, and at least two additional transitions (T2b and T4) are needed to enable T5 without enabling T3 first.
This sequence is reachable because all transitions fired are enabled at the time they were called, and the markings are consistent with the net's initial state and transitions.
