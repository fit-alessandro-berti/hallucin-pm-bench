**Answer: No, it is not possible** for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3** in any reachable marking of the net.

### **Proof of Impossibility**

To fire **T5**, the following conditions must be met:

- **p3** must have at least **1 token** (normal arc),
- **p4** must have **0 tokens** (inhibitor arc must *not* inhibit, i.e., p4 is empty).

Let's analyze the **only way tokens reach p3** and **p4**. 

- T1 fires when p0 is marked, resulting in **p1** and **p2** getting 1 token each.
- From p1, **T2** may fire and gives 1 token to p3.
- From p2, **T3** may fire and gives 1 token to p4.

Now consider:

- **T3 is the *only* way to give tokens to p4.**
- **T5 can only fire if p4 is empty**. Therefore, for T5 to fire, **T3 must not have fired yet**, or must have returned p4 to 0.

But:

- T3 **cannot fire after firing** because the only token in p4 can only go to p4 (as p2 only gives 1 token), and T4 consumes both p3 and p4 together (synchronisation), so **T3 has no possibility of firing again** after it has once moved the token to p4.

Therefore, **T5** can only be enabled **after p4 is empty**, which can only be the case **before T3 fires** or **after T3 is undone**. But in a **safe Petri net** (every place holds at most 1 token), **T4 consumes both p3 and p4 tokens**, and after that, they cannot be restored.

So, in summary:

- T5 can only fire when p4 is empty,
- T4 must fire for p4 to be consumed (by T3),
- T4 consumes p4 (along with p3),
- Therefore, **T3 *must* fire at least once** for p4 to be non-zero and then be consumed (possibly by T4),
- Hence, **T5 cannot fire before T3.**

### âœ… **Conclusion**

> **No**, it is **not possible** for **T5 to fire before T3** in any reachable marking of this Petri net.
