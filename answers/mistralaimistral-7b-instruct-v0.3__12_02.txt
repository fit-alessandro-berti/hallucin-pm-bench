 No, the stated fact is not accurate with respect to the log fragment. The only instances where Validate_Payment does not follow Receive_Order are C003 (Validate_Payment at line 6, Receive_Order at line 7) and C005 (Receive_Order at line 11, Cancel_Order at line 12, Validate_Payment at line 11). Therefore, the activity Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order in the given log.
