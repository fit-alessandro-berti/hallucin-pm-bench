1. The average cycle time (in hours) of activity “Approve Invoice” cannot be computed from the supplied log.

2. The standard deviation and a 95% confidence interval for the cycle time of activity “Approve Invoice” cannot be computed from the supplied log.

3. The requested metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval for the “Approve Invoice” activity) cannot be computed because Artefact A, the Event-Log Stub, explicitly states that “Every row and every timestamp value has been removed for privacy.” To calculate an activity's cycle time, the specific `start_time` and `complete_time` for each instance of that activity are required from the event log. Without this raw event data for the “Approve Invoice” activity, its individual durations cannot be determined, and therefore no statistical measures based on these durations (such as average, standard deviation, or confidence intervals) can be calculated from the supplied log. Artefact B provides historical, aggregated KPIs or broader SLAs, not the granular event log data needed for these specific computations.
