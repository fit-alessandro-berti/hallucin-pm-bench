The fact is not accurate. For example, in Case 1001 the sequence is:  
• Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued.  

Here, Authorize_Refund does not immediately precede Update_Inventory; instead, Update_Inventory occurs before Authorize_Refund. Additionally, in Case 1003, Authorize_Refund occurs after Update_Inventory (and after Quality_Check). Therefore, the claim does not hold true in the provided event-log fragment.
