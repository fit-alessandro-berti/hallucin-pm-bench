Let's analyze whether transition **T5** can fire before **T3** in any reachable marking of the given Petri net.

### Key Observations:
1. **T5's Enabling Condition**:
   - T5 requires a token in **p3** (normal arc) and **zero tokens in p4** (inhibitor arc).
   - Thus, T5 can only fire if **p4 is empty**.

2. **T3's Role**:
   - T3 moves a token from **p2** to **p4**.
   - Once T3 fires, **p4** gains a token, disabling T5 forever (since the inhibitor arc requires p4 to be empty).

3. **Order of Events**:
   - The initial marking has a token in **p0** only.
   - **T1** must fire first (parallel split), depositing tokens into **p1** and **p2**.
   - From here:
     - If **T2** fires (p1 → p3), **p3** gains a token, but **p4** is still empty (since T3 hasn't fired yet).
     - If **T3** fires (p2 → p4), **p4** gains a token, disabling T5 permanently.

### Can T5 Fire Before T3?
**Yes**, but only if **T2 fires before T3**. Here’s a concrete firing sequence:

#### Firing Sequence:
1. **T1**: p0 → p1 + p2
   (Marking: p1=1, p2=1, others=0)
2. **T2**: p1 → p3
   (Marking: p2=1, p3=1, others=0)
3. **T5**: p3 –|p4 → p6
   (Marking: p2=1, p6=1, others=0)

#### Justification:
- After **T1**, **p1** and **p2** each have a token.
- **T2** fires next, moving the token from **p1** to **p3**, while **p4** remains empty (T3 hasn’t fired yet).
- **T5** is now enabled (p3 has a token, p4 is empty) and can fire before T3.
- Once **T5** fires, **p6** gains a token, and **T3** can still fire later (but T5 cannot fire again because p4 will eventually have a token).

### Why This Works:
- The inhibitor arc from **p4** to **T5** only blocks T5 if **p4** has a token. Since **T3** is the only transition that adds tokens to **p4**, T5 can fire as long as **T3** hasn’t fired yet.
- The parallel split (T1) allows **T2** and **T3** to fire independently, so **T2** can precede **T3**, enabling **T5**.

### Conclusion:
**Yes**, T5 can fire before T3. The sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** demonstrates this.
