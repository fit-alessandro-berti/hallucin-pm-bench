No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking.

### Proof (by analyzing enabling conditions and token flow):

We start with the initial marking:

- M₀ = {p0: 1, p1: 0, p2: 0, p3: 0, p4: 0, p5: 0, p6: 0}

### Step 1: T1 is the only enabled transition
- Input: p0 has 1 token
- After T1 fires:  
  M₁ = {p0: 0, p1: 1, p2: 1, p3: 0, p4: 0, p5: 0, p6: 0}

### Step 2: T1 is now disabled.
From M₁:
- Enabled transitions: T2 (p1), T3 (p2)

To get to T5, we analyze its input:
- T5 requires:  
  - A token in p3 (standard arc)  
  - No token in p4 (inhibitor arc)

So T5 requires:
- p3: 1
- p4: 0

Therefore, to enable T5, we must fire T2 (to put a token in p3), but we must NOT have fired T3 yet (so p4 = 0).

So we consider this path:
- T1 → T2 → T5  

But can T5 fire at that point (after T2, before T3)? Let’s simulate the sequence:

#### T1 fires ⇒ M₁:
{p0:0, p1:1, p2:1, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0}

#### T2 fires ⇒ consumes p1, produces p3 ⇒ M₂:
{p0:0, p1:0, p2:1, p3:1, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0}

Now:
- p3 = 1 ✅
- p4 = 0 ✅
- T5 is now enabled

Thus: T5 is enabled and can fire before T3!

So the answer is: ✅ Yes, T5 can fire before T3.

### Concrete firing sequence:

T1 → T2 → T5

After each firing:

- M₀ = {p0:1, p1:0, p2:0, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0}  
→ T1 fires  
- M₁ = {p0:0, p1:1, p2:1, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0}  
→ T2 fires  
- M₂ = {p0:0, p1:0, p2:1, p3:1, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0}  
→ T5 fires  
- M₃ = {p0:0, p1:0, p2:1, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:1}

Hence, T5 completes before T3 fires (note: p2 still has its token, T3 untouched). ✅

### Final Answer:  
**Yes**, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.  
**Example firing sequence**: T1 → T2 → T5
