### 1) Average Cycle Time for "Review Contract"

**The requested value cannot be derived from the provided data.**

---

### 2) Explanation

To calculate the average cycle time (duration) of the "Review Contract" activity, I would need **timestamp information** — specifically:

- **Start timestamp** and **end timestamp** for each activity instance, OR
- **Activity duration** values, OR
- **Event timestamps** that would allow me to calculate the time elapsed between the start of "Review Contract" and the subsequent activity

However, as explicitly stated in the context header:

> *"timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted"*

The event log only contains three columns:
- `case_id`
- `activity`
- `resource`

**What I can confirm from the log:**
- "Review Contract" appears in **4 cases** (C-001, C-002, C-003, C-004)
- It is performed by resources: drafter_3 (twice), drafter_1, and drafter_4

**What I cannot determine:**
- How long each "Review Contract" activity took to complete
- Any temporal metrics without the redacted time fields

The historical benchmark provided is from FY-2023 and a **different customer segment**, so it cannot be used as a substitute for calculating metrics from this specific log.
