**Memo: Performance Analysis of Key Loan Processing Activities**

To: Chief Operating Officer  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Date: September 19, 2025  

Our loan application process reveals inefficiencies in activities exceeding Target SLA while incurring high waiting times. Based on average throughput and waiting times across cases, the three worst-performing activities are Legal Approval (900s throughput, exceeding 600s SLA by 300s, with 600s waiting), Risk Review (600s throughput, exceeding 300s SLA by 300s, with 480s waiting), and Credit Assessment (300s throughput, exceeding 240s SLA by 60s, with 200s waiting). These bottlenecks impact 465, 480, and 1175 cases respectively, delaying overall disbursement.  

To address these:  
- For Legal Approval, prioritize cases with 600s waiting by implementing a triage queue for the 465 cases, targeting a 50% reduction in wait to align with 600s SLA.  
- For Risk Review, allocate additional reviewers to handle the 480 cases, aiming to cut 480s waiting by 40% based on current throughput exceeding 300s SLA by 300s.  
- For Credit Assessment, automate initial scoring for the 1175 cases to reduce 200s waiting, focusing on the 60s SLA overrun observed in throughput.  

This will enhance cycle times without new resources. Word count: 148
