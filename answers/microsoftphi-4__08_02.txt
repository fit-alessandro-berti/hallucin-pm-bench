**Question 1:** No, it is not possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

**Question 2:** To fire **T5**, both **P2** and **P5** must have tokens. Token **P2** is only created if **T1** fires, followed by **T3** to place tokens in **P4** and then **T4** to move tokens to **P5**. Thus, firing **T3** is a prerequisite for **T5** to have both necessary tokens. No sequence exists where **T5** can fire before **T3**.
