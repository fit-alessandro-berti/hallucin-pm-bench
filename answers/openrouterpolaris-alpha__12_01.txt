No, the claim is not accurate.

Short justification:
- Case 1001: “Update_Inventory” occurs before “Authorize_Refund” (08:25:55 vs 08:30:02), not after.
- Case 1002: “Update_Inventory” does not appear at all, so “Authorize_Refund” cannot be immediately before it.
- Case 1003: “Update_Inventory” (10:08:07) occurs before “Authorize_Refund” (10:22:18), with “Quality_Check” in between, so they are not consecutive in the stated order.
