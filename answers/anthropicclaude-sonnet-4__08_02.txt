**Question 1:** No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Question 2:** No such sequence exists because of the token flow constraints in the Petri net.

For T5 to fire, it requires tokens in both P2 and P5. To get a token in P5, transition T4 must fire first. For T4 to fire, it needs a token in P4. 

There are only two ways to get a token in P4:
1. Through T7 (via P0→T1→P1→T2→P3→T7→P4)
2. Through T3 (via P0→T1→P2→T3→P4)

If we use path 1, we still need the token in P2 (from T1) for T5, but T3 would consume this token when creating the P4 token needed for the T4→T5 sequence.

The synchronization requirement makes T3 fire before T5 inevitable.
