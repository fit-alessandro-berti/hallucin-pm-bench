**Executive Memo – Orion Insurance: Top 3 Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting-Time**

**To:** COO, Orion Insurance
**From:** Process-Mining Analysis Team

**Key Findings:**
1. **Request Documents**: Avg waiting = 36.5h / 95% = 120h
2. **Send Closure Letter**: Avg = 12.2h / 95% = 44h
3. **Assess Liability**: Avg = 7.8h / 95% = 16.4h

**Data-Driven Actions:**
1. **Request Documents**: Implement automated reminders to customers at 24h and 72h post-request (target: 30% faster response rate).
2. **Send Closure Letter**: Batch letters for end-of-day dispatch to streamline mailing (reduce queue bottlenecks).
3. **Assess Liability**: Introduce triage rules to fast-track low-liability claims (e.g., auto-validate claims <$X).

Projected: ≥20% reduction in waiting times for each activity. Recommend a pilot for these actions within Q1.
