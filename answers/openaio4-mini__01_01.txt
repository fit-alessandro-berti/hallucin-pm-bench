Here are the decision points in Contoso’s refund process, with the artefacts each requires:

1. Eligibility Check by Triage Agent  
   Decision: Is the passenger’s claim eligible for refund?  
   Required documents:  
   • RefundRequestForm (submitted by customer)  
   • FlightManifest (to verify booking)  
   • WeatherReport (to confirm weather-related disruption)

2. Finance Pre-Approval  
   Decision: Does the claim meet Contoso’s financial/refund rules?  
   Required document:  
   • EligibilityChecklist (signed off by Finance Controller)

3. High-Value Determination  
   Decision: Is the approved refund amount greater than €1 000?  
   Required input:  
   • Calculation of refund amount (no additional document beyond the already approved form and checklist)

4. Senior Auditor Review (only if > €1 000)  
   Decision: Does the audit of the high-value claim pass compliance?  
   Required document:  
   • AuditTrail (must be attached to the case)

5. Payment Authorization  
   Decision: Are all pre-approve steps complete (and audit, if high-value) so that payment can proceed?  
   Required document:  
   • BankTransferAuthorization (signed off by finance team)

Once all decisions are positive and the required documents are in place, the team proceeds to Process_Refund_Payment and then Issue_Confirmation_Letter (sending the RefundConfirmationPDF to the passenger).
