Answer: Yes, it is possible. One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking is:

1) T1 (p0 → p1 + p2)  
   New marking: p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0

2) T2 (p1 → p3)  
   New marking: p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0

3) T5 (p3 –|p4 → p6)  
   (Enabled because p3=1 and p4=0.)  
   New marking: p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=1

4) T3 (p2 → p4)  
   New marking: p0=0, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=1, p5=0, p6=1

Hence T5 fires before T3. The key step is that once p3 has a token while p4 is still empty, T5 is enabled by the inhibitor arc on p4 and can fire immediately, preceding T3.
