1. **No.**

2. **Counterexamples in the log:**

- **Case C002:**  
  - Sequence: `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  - Here, **Pack_Items** occurs between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, so they are **not** immediate.

- **Case C004:**  
  - Sequence: `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  - Here, **Check_Fraud** occurs between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, so they are **not** immediate.

Even though in **C001** (`Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`) and **C003** (`Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order`) the statement holds, the FACT claims “always,” which is violated by **C002** and **C004**.
