   - The fragment covers only **a single day** (May 1), which may not represent monthly variability (e.g., differences in fraud checks between weekdays/weekends, promotions, or seasonal trends).  
   - The **sample size (18 events) is too small** to reliably estimate monthly frequency, as rare activities like "Manual_Fraud_Check" (occurring only once) may have high sampling error in small datasets.
