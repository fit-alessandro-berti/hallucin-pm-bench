**No, the fact is not accurate.**

**Justification:**

The claim states that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately *before* "Update_Inventory," but the data show the opposite sequence:

- **Case 1001**: Update_Inventory (08:25:55) occurs *before* Authorize_Refund (08:30:02)
- **Case 1003**: Update_Inventory (10:08:07) occurs *before* Authorize_Refund (10:22:18)

Additionally, **Case 1002** has Authorize_Refund but no Update_Inventory activity at all.

In the cases where both activities appear, Update_Inventory consistently precedes Authorize_Refund, which is the reverse of what the fact claims.
