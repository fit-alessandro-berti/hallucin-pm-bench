**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Brief  

The three worst-performing activities, based on *sla_breach_pct* (most critical metric for SLA compliance) and *rework_rate_pct*, are:  

1. **Request_Documents**  
   *Why:* Highest rework rate (22.0%) and SLA breach (5.5%); 150-min avg wait time delays initial input.  
   *Action:* Implement automated document validation to reduce rework (22% of cases require repeats).  

2. **Review_Documents**  
   *Why:* Highest SLA breach (12.4%) and second-highest rework (5.3%); 30-min avg wait + high processing variability (stdev=9).  
   *Action:* Redesign workflow to standardize document review (target stdev reduction by 50%).  

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   *Why:* Highest avg wait time (18 mins) and third-highest SLA breach (3.2%); 1.8% rework rate.  
   *Action:* Allocate dedicated staff during peak hours to cut wait time (current 18 mins exceeds others by 10Ã—).  

All three activities contribute disproportionately to delays and rework. Prioritizing these will directly improve SLA adherence and reduce processing costs. *No further differentiation among candidates is possible based on data.*
