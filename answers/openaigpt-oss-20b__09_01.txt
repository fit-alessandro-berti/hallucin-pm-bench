I’m sorry, but the event log you provided contains only the columns **case_id**, **activity**, and **resource**—no timestamps or duration data are included. Without elapsed‑time information for each “Review Contract” activity, it is impossible to calculate an average cycle time. Therefore, the requested value cannot be derived from the data provided.
