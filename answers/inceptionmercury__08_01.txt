No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Proof of Impossibility:**

*   **Initial Marking:** p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
*   **T5's Enabling Condition:** T5 can only fire if p3 has at least one token and p4 has zero tokens.
*   **T3's Effect:** T3 consumes a token from p2 and produces a token in p3.

To enable T5, we need a token in p3.  The only way to get a token in p3 is by firing T3. Therefore, T3 must fire *before* T5 can be enabled.
