### 2️⃣ Why This Snippet May Mislead (≤120 words)

An analyst viewing only this excerpt might misestimate manual fraud check frequency for several reasons:

1. **Small sample size**: Only 3 cases from a single morning cannot represent a full month's volume or variation.

2. **Activity naming inconsistency**: The log contains "Automatic Fraud Check" (Case 1001) and "Fraud Check (Automatic)" (Case 1003)—suggesting potential labeling variations. A "Manual Fraud Check" variant with different naming may exist elsewhere undetected.

3. **Temporal bias**: This snippet captures ~2 hours on March 1st. Patterns may differ by weekday, time-of-day, or as monthly volumes fluctuate.

4. **Case-type distribution**: The mix of cases requiring manual vs. automatic review may not be representative of the broader population.
