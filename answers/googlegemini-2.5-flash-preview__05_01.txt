To meet the SLA without new tasks, add an Intermediate Catching Timer Event to the `Task_Receive` activity. Set the timer duration to 48 hours.  Connect this timer event to a `Boundary Event` that then flows directly to `Task_Triage` (`Task_Triage`).  This creates a detour, skipping `Task_Check` and `GW_Docs` if the claim isn't triaged within the deadline, thus forcing the claim into triage (`Task_Triage`) and meeting the SLA.
