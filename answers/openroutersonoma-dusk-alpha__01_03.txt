### a) Decision Points in Acme’s Process

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check**: This step evaluates inputs from the Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow to assign an overall risk rating of Low, Medium, or High.

2. **Risk-Based Skip of Manual Underwriting**: If the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review) is skipped; otherwise, it is performed.
