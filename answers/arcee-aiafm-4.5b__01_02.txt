Let me walk through the process step by step to identify the decision points and required documents.

**Decision Points:**

1. **Quick KYC Verification** - The decision to move forward requires verification of ID and mobile phone.
2. **Dual Underwriter Score-Gate** - The outcome depends on whether the two underwriters' risk scores are within 2 points of each other.
3. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check** - The ability to proceed requires obtaining at least 3 local references.
4. **Amount Threshold Decision** - The next step is determined by whether the loan amount is less than €15,000.

**Required Documents:**

1. Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
2. Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
3. Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
4. Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
5. Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
6. Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)
