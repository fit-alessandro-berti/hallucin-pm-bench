1. **The average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be determined from the provided data.**

2. **Explanation**: The event log contains activity names, resources, and case IDs, but **no timestamp or elapsed-time information** for any activity (as stated in the context: "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted"). Cycle time calculation requires start and end times (or duration) for each instance of an activity. Since durations are missing and only historical benchmarks (from a different customer segment) are provided, we cannot compute the actual average cycle time of "Review Contract" from this log. The historical benchmark is not applicable here as it refers to a different segment and does not include data for "Review Contract".
