### Decision Points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

1.  **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)**
    *   Decision: Is the applicant's ID card and mobile phone successfully verified?
    *   Outcome: If yes, the process continues. If no, the application is halted.

2.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate**
    *   Decision: Is the difference between the risk scores from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B** ≤ 2 points?
    *   Outcome: If yes, the process continues. If no, the application is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** before proceeding.

3.  **Amount Threshold Decision**
    *   Decision: Is the requested loan amount < €15 000?
    *   Outcome: If yes, the system auto-approves the loan. If no (amount ≥ €15 000), the application proceeds to the Final Micro-loan Board.

4.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**
    *   Decision: The board votes to either *approve* or *reject* the application.
    *   Outcome: This is the final decision point for applications ≥ €15 000.
