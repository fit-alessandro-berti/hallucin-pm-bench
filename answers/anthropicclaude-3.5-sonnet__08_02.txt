Let me analyze this step by step:

**Answer 1**: Yes, T5 can fire before T3.

**Answer 2**: Here's a minimal firing sequence that demonstrates this:
T1, T2, T7, T4, T5

Explanation: Starting from M0={P0}:
1. T1 fires, putting tokens in P1 and P2
2. T2 fires, moving token from P1 to P3
3. T7 fires, moving token from P3 to P4
4. T4 fires, moving token from P4 to P5
5. Now P2 and P5 both have tokens, enabling T5 to fire

At this point, T3 hasn't fired yet, but T5 can and does fire. This demonstrates that T5 can indeed fire before T3. Note that T3 is on a parallel path but isn't required for T5's firing conditions to be met.
