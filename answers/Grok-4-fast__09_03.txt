The supplied event log (Artefact A) contains only column headers with no actual data rows or timestamp values, as explicitly stated that every row and timestamp has been removed for privacy reasons. Without any complete_time or start_time values associated with the "Approve Invoice" activity, it is impossible to calculate cycle times (as differences between these timestamps), let alone derive the average, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval from the log. Artefact B provides historical averages for a different subprocess but no raw or aggregated data specific to "Approve Invoice" cycle times in the current log.
