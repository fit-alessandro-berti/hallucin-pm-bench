1) **Average cycle time for “Review Contract” (hours): _Cannot be derived from the provided data._**

2) **Why:**  
To compute an average cycle time for an activity, the log must contain either:
- **start and end timestamps** for each “Review Contract” event, or
- an **elapsed/duration field** per event.

In the excerpt you provided, only **case_id, activity, resource** are visible, and you explicitly noted that **timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted**. Therefore, there is no time-based information available to calculate the cycle time for “Review Contract” (or any other activity) from this log segment.
