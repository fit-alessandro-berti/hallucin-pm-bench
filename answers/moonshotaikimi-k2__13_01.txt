1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs exactly 1 time in this fragment.  
2. Percentage of all logged events:  
   1 occurrence / 18 total events = 5.56 % (rounded to two decimal places).  
3. Case identifier(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”: A1002.  
4. Two sampling-related reasons why the monthly frequency estimate would be unreliable:  
   1. The fragment covers only a small slice of a single day, so any projection would extrapolate from a tiny temporal sample.  
   2. The fragment likely captures only a subset of distinct cases (only four are shown), risking a selection bias if those cases are not representative of the entire month’s population.
