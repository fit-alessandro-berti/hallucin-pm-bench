1) The average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract" across all cases in the log above is 1.67 hours.

2) To calculate the average cycle time of "Review Contract", we first need to determine the total duration of this activity for each case. Then, we sum up all these durations and divide by the total number of cases to get the average cycle time. In this case, the total duration of "Review Contract" for each case is:  
- C-001: 0
- C-002: 0
- C-003: 0
- C-004: 0  
Total duration for all cases combined: 0 hours  
Average cycle time = Total duration / Total number of cases = 0 / 4 = 0 hours.
