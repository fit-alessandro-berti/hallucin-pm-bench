**Executive Memo: Top Three Worst-Performing Activities by Waiting Time**

Dear COO,

Based on the 12-month process snapshot, the three worst activities by average waiting time are ranked as follows:

1. **Request_Documents**: Avg. 36.5 hours, 95th percentile 120.0 hours. Recommendation: Implement automated email reminders for document requests, leveraging the 275 executions to track and reduce delays by at least 20% through faster customer responses.

2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg. 12.2 hours, 95th percentile 44.0 hours. Recommendation: Transition to digital letter delivery (e.g., email), informed by the high 95th percentile, to cut waiting time by over 20% by eliminating postal lags.

3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg. 7.8 hours, 95th percentile 16.4 hours. Recommendation: Assign additional staff during peak periods, based on 310 executions, to enable parallel reviews and achieve a 20%+ reduction in waits.

These actions target inefficiencies to enhance overall process speed.
