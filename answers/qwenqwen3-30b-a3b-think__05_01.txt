Add a **boundary timer event** to **Task_Check** (ID: "Task_Check") with a 48-hour duration. If uncompleted within this time, trigger an **escalation event** to **Task_Triage** (ID: "Task_Triage") via a modified flow. This ensures the process meets the SLA by forcing escalation if the check exceeds 48 hours, bypassing delays. (120 words)
