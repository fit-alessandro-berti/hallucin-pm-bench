Given the artefacts provided, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity because:

1. The event log (Artefact A) contains no actual dataâ€”only column headers. Without the timestamps (start_time and complete_time) for each instance of "Approve Invoice," we cannot calculate cycle times or any derived statistics.
2. The SLA excerpt (Artefact B) mentions an average time from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice" (7.8 days), but this is a historical KPI for a different process segment (between two activities, not a single activity's duration).

Thus, no metrics can be computed from the given information. No assumptions or external data can substitute for the missing event log data.
