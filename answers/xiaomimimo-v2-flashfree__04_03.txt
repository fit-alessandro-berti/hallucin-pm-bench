**No**

The trace violates two rules:
- **Rule 1:** It requires QE then RA in that order, but the trace has QE → RA. That part is correct. However, checking the sequence: `Quality_Engineer_Review` then `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is in order. Actually, wait—the trace is `Quality_Engineer_Review, Notify_Authorities, Regulatory_Affairs_Review`. QE is before RA, so that part is okay. So Rule 1 is satisfied? Wait, I need to re-read. Rule 1: QE and RA must occur once each and in that order. The trace has QE first, then RA later, so yes, order is preserved. The presence of NA in between doesn't violate Rule 1, because Rule 1 doesn't forbid other activities between QE and RA. So Rule 1 is okay. 

- **Rule 3:** NA must not occur until after QE and RA are complete. Here, NA occurs after QE but before RA, so RA is not complete yet. Therefore, Rule 3 is violated.  
- **Rule 2:** For high severity, VP must happen after both QE and RA. In the trace, VP occurs after QE and RA (since QE, then later RA, then VP). So Rule 2 is satisfied.  
- **Rule 4:** CC must occur after NA and (if required) after VP. In the trace, CC occurs after VP, which is after NA, so Rule 4 is satisfied.

Wait, did I mis-order? The trace: `<create_case, capture_event_details, Quality_Engineer_Review, Notify_Authorities, Regulatory_Affairs_Review, VP_Safety_Approval, Close_Case>`

Sequence:
1. create_case
2. capture_event_details
3. Quality_Engineer_Review (QE)
4. Notify_Authorities (NA)
5. Regulatory_Affairs_Review (RA)
6. VP_Safety_Approval (VP)
7. Close_Case (CC)

So QE before RA, but NA is before RA. Rule 3 says NA must not occur until after QE and RA are complete. "After QE and RA are complete" implies both must be done before NA. Here, NA is done after QE but before RA, so RA is not complete. Therefore, Rule 3 is violated.

Rule 1: QE and RA must occur once each and in that order. The order is QE then RA, so it's fine. The presence of NA in between doesn't affect Rule 1.

Rule 2: Since severity is High, VP must happen after both QE and RA. VP occurs after RA (RA is at position 5, VP at 6), so yes.

Rule 4: CC must occur after NA and, if required by rule 2, after VP. CC occurs after VP (which is after NA), so it's fine.

Thus, only Rule 3 is violated. So overall non-compliant. The answer is "No".**No**

The trace violates **Rule 3**: `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, but Rule 3 requires NA to wait until **both** QE and RA are complete.  

All other rules are satisfied:
- **Rule 1**: QE → RA order is preserved.  
- **Rule 2** (severity = High): VP occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 4**: CC occurs after NA and after VP (which is required).
