Yes – T5 can fire before T3.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking M0 =  
(p0 1, p1 0, p2 0, p3 0, p4 0, p5 0, p6 0) is

1. T1          → (p0 0, p1 1, p2 1, p3 0, p4 0, p5 0, p6 0)  
2. T2          → (p0 0, p1 0, p2 1, p3 1, p4 0, p5 0, p6 0)  
3. T5          → (p0 0, p1 0, p2 1, p3 0, p4 0, p5 0, p6 1)  
4. (T3 and T4 may still fire afterwards.)

Justification  
• After step 2, place p3 holds one token and place p4 is still empty because T3 has not fired.  
• Therefore the enabling conditions of T5 are satisfied: normal arc from p3 is marked, and the inhibitor arc from p4 sees zero tokens.  
• Hence T5 can fire in step 3, i.e. before T3 has occurred.

Thus it is indeed possible for T5 to fire before T3.
