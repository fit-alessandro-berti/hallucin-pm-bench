Subject: Prioritizing Remediation of SLA-Breaching, High-Waiting Activities

Our latest process analysis highlights three activities that are underperforming both in meeting their SLA targets and in minimizing average waiting times:

1. **Risk Review** exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (600s avg. throughput vs. 300s SLA) and has an average waiting time of 480s, making it the most significant bottleneck.
2. **Credit Assessment** surpasses its SLA by 60 seconds (300s vs. 240s), with a substantial waiting time of 200s.
3. **Legal Approval** exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (900s vs. 600s) and shows very high waiting times at 600s.

**Recommendations:**
- Risk Review: Prioritize immediate review of resource allocation to this stage to reduce throughput and queuing delays.
- Credit Assessment: Optimize upstream handover from "Verify Identity" to reduce onboarding lag, addressing delays before this step.
- Legal Approval: Reevaluate case prioritization and workload balancing within legal to decrease wait times and meet SLA targets.
