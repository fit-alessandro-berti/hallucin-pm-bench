Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants a RACI matrix using only the authorized vocabulary provided in the system prompt. First, I need to make sure I fully understand all the components required.

**Step 1: Identify the Activities Using Authorized Vocabulary**
The process narrative mentions several activities, but I need to map them to the authorized terms strictly:
- "Preliminary Assessment" is mentioned, but the authorized term is **Intake Vetting**.
- "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)" must be referred to as **KYC Review**.
- "Sanctions Check" is mentioned, but the correct term is **AML Screening**.
- "Derives a risk rating" should be termed **Risk Scoring**.

**Step 2: List All Roles from the Roster**
- Front-Office Analyst
- Compliance Analyst
- Compliance Officer
- Treasury Ops
These roles are explicitly mentioned in the roster and must all be included in the matrix.

**Step 3: Define RACI Components**
- **R (Responsible)**: Who performs the activity?
- **A (Accountable)**: Who has ultimate accountability for the activity’s completion and correctness?
- **C (Consulted)**: Who is consulted during the activity?
- **I (Informed)**: Who is informed after the activity is done?

**Step 4: Map Activities to Roles with RACI Assignments**
- **Intake Vetting**
  - Performed by Front-Office Analyst (R).
  - Accountable: Maybe themselves? Or is there someone else in the approvals chain?
  - Consulted: Perhaps Compliance Analyst?
  - Informed: The next step is KYC Review by Compliance Analyst, so maybe they are informed.

  However, typically, the Front-Office Analyst would be responsible and accountable for ensuring paperwork completeness. There might not be consultation needed here, and the next role (Compliance Analyst) is informed.

- **KYC Review**
  - Performed by Compliance Analyst (R).
  - Accountable: Likely Compliance Analyst holds accountability for proper CDD.
  - Consulted: Maybe Compliance Officer?
  - Informed: Front-Office Analyst or Treasury Ops? Possibly after completion.

- **AML Screening**
  - Also performed by Compliance Analyst (R).
  - Accountable: Compliance Analyst.
  - Consulted: Maybe Compliance Officer, especially if there are issues.
  - Informed: Similar to KYC Review.

- **Risk Scoring**
  - Performed by Compliance Analyst (R).
  - If the score is >70, it escalates to Compliance Officer for approval.
  - Accountable: Compliance Analyst for creating the score, but if approved, Compliance Officer might be accountable.
  - However, RACI typically assigns ‘A’ to the approver when needed. Since the case is reviewed/approved by Compliance Officer if >70, maybe they are accountable here.

- **Compliance Officer Approval** (if Risk Score >70)
  - Compliance Officer would be consulted or approve here.

  Wait, is Compliance Officer Approval a separate activity? The process states that if the score exceeds 70, it escalates for their approval. So maybe in the RACI matrix, there is an activity "Approval" (though the user emphasized not to rename or add activities). However, the original activities were only four: Intake Vetting, CDD (KYC), Sanctions (AML), and the derivation of the risk score.

  Hmm, reviewing the process narrative: "Cases whose score exceeds 70 escalate for Compliance Officer approval; otherwise, Treasury Ops can schedule the payment."

  This suggests that Approval is not a distinct activity but part of the process flow depending on the Risk Scoring outcome.

  However, the user explicitly states **"do not rename, merge, or add activities,"** so I need to work only with the four enumerated activities.

  The original activities converted are:
  1. Intake Vetting
  2. KYC Review
  3. AML Screening
  4. Risk Scoring

  The approval gate seems to conditionally involve the Compliance Officer after Risk Scoring, but since the user hasn't listed "Approval" as an activity, it might be an assumption to exclude it. However, for the matrix to be accurate, perhaps I should include the Compliance Officer's approval as part of the Risk Scoring activity if the score is high. But the user said return only activities described in the process, and only use the authorized vocabulary. The activities above are the only four. The approval is part of the conditional process but not an activity in itself. Therefore, Compliance Officer's role might sit under Risk Scoring when further action is needed.

**Step 5: Construct the RACI Matrix**

For each activity, assign R, A, C, I to each role.

1. **Intake Vetting**
   - R: Front-Office Analyst
   - A: Front-Office Analyst? Or is there someone like their manager? (but no other role is mentioned)
   - C: None given.
   - I: Compliance Analyst needs to be informed to start KYC Review.

2. **KYC Review**
   - R: Compliance Analyst
   - A: Compliance Analyst
   - C: Perhaps Compliance Officer in complex cases, but not specified. Maybe none.
   - I: Front-Office Analyst might need to know status, but the process doesn't state who is informed. Or Treasury Ops might be informed after completion.

3. **AML Screening**
   - Similar to KYC:
     - R: Compliance Analyst
     - A: Compliance Analyst
     - C: Compliance Officer
     - I: Treasury Ops maybe, but not clear.

4. **Risk Scoring**
   - R: Compliance Analyst
   - A: If score >70, the Compliance Officer becomes accountable for the approval; otherwise, Treasury Ops can proceed.
   - Therefore, A (Accountable) could be:
     - If score ≤70: Treasury Ops is accountable for payment scheduling.
     - If score >70: Compliance Officer is accountable for approval.

   But in RACI, accountability usually lies with one person or role with ultimate sign-off. In this case, the Compliance Officer is accountable for high-risk approval, but the Risk Scoring itself is done by the Compliance Analyst. So in the activity "Risk Scoring," which is generating the score, the R is the Compliance Analyst, and the A might be the Compliance Analyst. But the consequential step is escalated only if necessary. Alternatively, "Risk Scoring" could have A as N/A or still the analyst, and the approval is part of a separate hidden step. However, since the RACI must cover each activity and the approval is part of the Risk Scoring outcome, I might need to indicate Consulted/Informed roles for that.

   Given that Treasury Ops proceeds only if the score is <=70, then for "Risk Scoring":
   - R: Compliance Analyst
   - A: Compliance Analyst scores it. But if >70, Compliance Officer then becomes accountable for the approval.
   - However, "Risk Scoring" as an activity is creating the score. The approval is conditional on that score but is a separate decision point. Since the user said not to add activities, I can't list an Approval step, but only the four given.

   This is tricky. Maybe the "Risk Scoring" activity includes the outcome. So if A is the Compliance Officer only when score >70, but otherwise it's Treasury Ops. But in RACI, a role can be Consulted or Informed differently based on conditions, but it's simpler to have static assignments. Alternatively, the Compliance Officer is Consulted only if the score is high, or Informed. But since RACI doesn't typically conditionally assign, perhaps:

   For Risk Scoring:
   - R: Compliance Analyst
   - A: Compliance Analyst (for creating the score) or Compliance Officer (if high risk, but that’s not accurate since the Analyst is creating it).
   - Perhaps the correct assignment is that the Compliance Analyst is Responsible, and their manager or the Compliance Officer is Accountable for the overall risk assessment process. However, in this case, the Analyst derives the risk score, so they might be both R and A.

   After thinking, it's best to assign Accountable to the role that takes final responsibility for the activity's result. Here, the Compliance Analyst performs the scoring, so they might be accountable. However, the Compliance Officer has the final say on high-risk cases, implying they hold ultimate accountability for the final decision.

   This points to a flaw in the process since Approval isn't an activity. But given the constraints, I'll proceed.

**Step 6: Build the Matrix**

Given the above, here's the RACI matrix:

| Activity          | Front-Office Analyst | Compliance Analyst | Compliance Officer | Treasury Ops |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Intake Vetting    | R, A                 | I                 |                    |              |
| KYC Review        |                      | R, A              | C                  | I            |
| AML Screening     |                      | R, A              | C                  | I            |
| Risk Scoring      |                      | R                | A (if score >70)   | I (if score <=70) |

Wait, but in standard RACI, each cell has one of R, A, C, I. Multiple letters can be in a cell if a role has multiple responsibilities. Alternatively, sometimes a role can be Consulted (C) for multiple activities.

However, conditional assignments (like A only if score >70) are not typically modeled in RACI; the matrix represents static assignments. Therefore, perhaps Compliance Officer is Consulted for Risk Scoring and they become Accountable for high-risk approvals, but since Approval isn't an activity, in the Risk Scoring row, the Officer is Consulted if needed, and Accountable for the final decision, while the Analyst performs the scoring.

But from the narrative: "Cases whose score exceeds 70 escalate for Compliance Officer approval"; thus, Compliance Officer's role is to Approve (Accountable) if the score is high, though the base Risk Scoring is done by the analyst. This suggests that in the Risk Scoring row, the Accountable is the Compliance Officer if escalation is needed, but that's not how RACI usually works.

Alternatively, risk scoring creates the score, and approval is a subsequent step handled by the Compliance Officer, but since the user says only the four activities, perhaps the escalation is part of the Risk Scoring activity. In that case:

- **Risk Scoring Activity**
  - R: Compliance Analyst (calculates the score)
  - A: Compliance Officer is Accountable for the outcome of Risk Scoring if the score is high, else perhaps Treasury Ops is Accountable for proceeding with the payment.
  But how to denote that in the matrix?

Given the complexity and the need to stick strictly to the authorized terms and roles, I will assign based on the standard responsibility:

- **Risk Scoring**:
  - R: Compliance Analyst (derives the score)
  - A: Compliance Analyst (they perform the technical activity)
  - However, if their score is high, the decision to approve is escalated to the Compliance Officer, who then becomes responsible for that decision. But since Approval isn't a listed activity, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the "Risk Scoring" activity includes the approval step when escalated. If so:

- The Compliance Analyst performs Risk Scoring (R)
- For cases >70, Compliance Office is Accountable for approval (A)
- Compliance Officer may be Consulted (C) during Risk Scoring if needed
- Treasury Ops are Informed (I) if it's ready to proceed (score <=70)

Given the ambiguity and the constraints, this is my best guess for the RACI matrix using only the given activities and roles.

**Step 7: Finalize the RACI Assignments**

- **Intake Vetting**:
  - R: Front-Office Analyst
  - A: Front-Office Analyst (assuming they are accountable for its completion)
  - I: Compliance Analyst (so they know to start KYC)

- **KYC Review**:
  - R: Compliance Analyst
  - A: Compliance Analyst (accountable for proper CDD)
  - C: Compliance Officer (for consultation on complex cases)
  - I: Treasury Ops (to know if they can proceed)

- **AML Screening**:
  - R: Compliance Analyst
  - A: Compliance Analyst (responsible for watchlist screening)
  - C: Compliance Officer (if needed)
  - I: Treasury Ops

- **Risk Scoring**:
  - R: Compliance Analyst
  - C: Compliance Officer (if score >70, their input/approval is needed)
  - A: Compliance Officer (since they must approve high-risk scores; the analyst generates the score, but the Officer is accountable for final sign-off)
  - I: Treasury Ops (to take action based on the score)

The matrix would look like:

| Activity          | Front-Office Analyst | Compliance Analyst | Compliance Officer | Treasury Ops |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Intake Vetting    | R, A                | I                 |                    |              |
| KYC Review        |                     | R, A              | C                  | I            |
| AML Screening     |                     | R, A              | C                  | I            |
| Risk Scoring      |                     | R                 | A, C               | I            |

However, in Intake Vetting, the Front-Office Analyst is R, A and the Compliance Analyst is Informed (I). That seems accurate.

For Risk Scoring, if the Compliance Officer is Accountable when the score is high (for their approval), then they are A only when needed. But in RACI, it's more static. 

Given all the points above, this seems the most reasonable assignment, ensuring all activities and roles are covered with R, A, C, or I as applicable.
| Activity          | Front-Office Analyst | Compliance Analyst | Compliance Officer | Treasury Ops |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Intake Vetting    | R, A                | I                 |                    |              |
| KYC Review        |                     | R, A              | C                  | I            |
| AML Screening     |                     | R, A              | C                  | I            |
| Risk Scoring      |                     | R                 | A, C               | I            |

**Key explanations:**
- **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office Analyst owns this activity end-to-end (Responsible and Accountable), while Compliance Analyst is Informed to begin their part.
- **KYC Review & AML Screening**: Performed by Compliance Analyst (Responsible and Accountable), with Compliance Officer as Consulted for complex cases, and Treasury Ops Informed of outcomes.
- **Risk Scoring**: Compliance Analyst is Responsible for deriving the score. Compliance Officer is ultimately Accountable (particularly for scores >70 requiring their sign-off) and Consulted on risk evaluations. Treasury Ops is Informed to schedule payments for cases ≤70.
