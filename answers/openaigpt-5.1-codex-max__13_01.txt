1. It occurs **1** time in this fragment.  
2. That is **5.56 %** of all logged events (1 out of 18).  
3. The case containing “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.  
4. The estimate is unreliable because (a) the fragment covers only a tiny time window (one partial day), so it may not be representative of the full month’s activity, and (b) the sample size is very small (18 events, 4 cases), so any rate derived from it is highly sensitive to chance variation and potential selection bias.
