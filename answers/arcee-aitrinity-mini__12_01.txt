Based strictly on the provided event-log fragment:

**No, the fact is inaccurate.**

**Justification:**

1.  **Case 1001 (2025-03-01):** The activities occur in this order:
    `Update_Inventory` (08:30:02) -> `Authorize_Refund` (08:45:12)
    Here, **Update_Inventory occurs first, followed later by Authorize_Refund**, contradicting the claim that Authorize_Refund happens immediately before Update_Inventory.

2.  **Case 1003 (2025-03-03):** The activities occur in this order:
    `Update_Inventory` (10:08:07) -> `Quality_Check` (10:15:42) -> `Authorize_Refund` (10:22:18)
    Here, **Update_Inventory occurs followed by a Quality_Check later by Authorize_Refund**, not immediately before Authorize_Refund.

Case 1002 (2025-03-02) does not contain the `Update_Inventory` activity, so it provides no evidence for the claim either.

Therefore, in the fragment, there are cases (`1001`, `1003`) where `Update_Inventory` occurs *after* `Authorize_Refund`, disproving the universal "always" requirement stated in the fact.
