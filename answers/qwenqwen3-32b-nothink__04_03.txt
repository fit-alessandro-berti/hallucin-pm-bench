**Answer: No**

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1:** Violated.  
  `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur **once each and in that order**. In the trace, QE occurs **before** RA, which is correct, but **RA is not completed before `Notify_Authorities`**, which is a problem (see Rule 3).

- **Rule 2:** Violated.  
  Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must occur **after both QE and RA**. In the trace, VP occurs **after RA**, which is correct, but **RA is not completed before `Notify_Authorities`**, which affects the sequence.

- **Rule 3:** Violated.  
  `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must **not occur until after** both QE and RA are complete. In the trace, NA occurs **after QE but before RA**, which is a violation.

- **Rule 4:** Satisfied.  
  `Close_Case` (CC) occurs **after** NA and VP, which is correct.

**Overall, the trace is not compliant due to violations of Rules 1, 2, and 3.**
