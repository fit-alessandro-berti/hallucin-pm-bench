Here are the decision points and required documents for Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process:

**Decision Points:**

1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: Decides flow based on the difference between Senior Underwriter A's and Shadow Underwriter B's risk scores.
    *   If scores differ by ≤ 2 points, proceed to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.
    *   Else, escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee**.
2.  **Amount Threshold Decision**: Determines the final approval path based on the requested loan amount.
    *   If amount < €15 000, the system auto-approves.
    *   If amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.
3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: For loans ≥ €15 000, the board makes the final *approve* or *reject* decision.
