Memo to: COO, Orion Credit

Subject: Process Performance Summary - Key Bottlenecks Identified

This memo highlights critical process performance areas based on recent activity data. Analysis focusing on activities with both target SLA breaches and high waiting times identifies three key areas for improvement:

Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment activities significantly exceed their target SLAs. Legal Approval averages 900s throughput time, breaching its 600s target SLA by 300s, and has the highest waiting time of 600s. Risk Review averages 600s throughput time, exceeding its 300s target SLA by 300s, with an average waiting time of 480s. Credit Assessment averages 300s throughput time, surpassing its 240s target SLA by 60s, and shows an average waiting time of 200s. Addressing the substantial waiting times in these activities is crucial for improving throughput performance.

Recommendations to address these performance issues:

*   For Legal Approval, investigate the root causes of the 600s average waiting time to reduce throughput time below 600s.
*   For Risk Review, analyze the factors contributing to the 480s average waiting time to bring throughput time below 300s.
*   For Credit Assessment, identify reasons for the 200s average waiting time to align throughput time with the 240s target SLA.

This focus area represents a significant opportunity to reduce overall process time.
