Subject: Critical Process Delays Requiring Immediate Intervention  

Analysis of throughput and waiting times against SLA targets reveals three severely underperforming activities. **Legal Approval** exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds (900s actual), with 600s spent waiting—two-thirds of total time. **Risk Review** breaches its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds (600s actual), 480s of which are idle. **Credit Assessment** exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds (300s actual), with 200s in waiting—67% of cycle time.  

- Reallocate or cross-train staff to reduce Legal Approval’s 600-second waiting time, which drives its SLA breach.  
- Investigate upstream bottlenecks causing Risk Review’s 480-second wait; consider parallel processing for high-volume cases.  
- Automate data validation in Credit Assessment to cut its 200-second waiting period and bring total time within the 240-second SLA.
