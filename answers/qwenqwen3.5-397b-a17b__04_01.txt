Non-compliant

1. **Rule 2 Violation:** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (Event 4), which mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at Event 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at Event 9.
2. **Rule 3 Violation:** Activity `Three_way_match` (Event 10) must be completed **within the next two activities** following `Goods_Received` (Event 6). In this trace, there are three intervening activities (`Move_to_Quality`, `Ship_Goods`, `Risk_Assessment`), placing `Three_way_match` at a distance of 4 activities, which exceeds the allowed limit.
