### Decision Points in Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track process:
1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** - Verification that involves confirming the identity of the applicant using their ID card and mobile phone number.
2. **Dual Underwriter Split** - Two underwriters independently assign risk scores:
   - **Senior Underwriter A** gives a score.
   - **Shadow Underwriter B** gives a score.
3. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**:
   - If scores from the underwriters differ by 2 points or less, the process continues.
   - If the difference is greater than 2 points, the decision is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee.
4. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** - Requires gathering at least 3 local references.
5. **Amount Threshold Decision**:
   - If the requested loan amount is less than €15,000, the system automatically approves the loan.
   - If the requested loan amount is €15,000 or more, the process moves to the next step for board review.
6. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** - The Micro-loan Board votes to approve or reject loan applications requesting €15,000 or more.
