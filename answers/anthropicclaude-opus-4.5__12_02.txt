**No**

The claim is inaccurate because there are cases where *Validate_Payment* does **not** follow *Receive_Order*. In **C003** (lines 6–7), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 10:43:00Z **before** *Receive_Order* at 10:45:00Z, meaning the order is reversed. Additionally, in **C005** (lines 11–12), *Validate_Payment* occurs but there is no *Receive_Order* event at all in the log fragment for that case—it is followed by *Cancel_Order* instead. These two cases demonstrate that *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* in this log.
