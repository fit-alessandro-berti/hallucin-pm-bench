4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.  
- **Small sample size**: The log contains only 18 events and just 1 instance of "Manual_Fraud_Check", making it statistically insufficient to reliably estimate monthly frequency.  
- **Lack of temporal representativeness**: The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01), so it may not represent variations in fraud checks across different days, weeks, or months.
