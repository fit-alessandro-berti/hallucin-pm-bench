### Decision points in Contoso’s refund process

1. **Eligibility check** (`Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility`)  
   - Decision: whether the claim is eligible based on the **FlightManifest** and **WeatherReport**.

2. **Finance pre-approval** (`Finance_Controller_PreApprove`)  
   - Decision: whether finance signs off using the **EligibilityChecklist**.

3. **High-value threshold**  
   - Decision: is the refund amount **> €1,000**?  
   - If **yes**: **Senior_Auditor_Review** is required and must include the **AuditTrail**.  
   - If **no**: skip senior auditor review.

4. **Payment gate** (`Process_Refund_Payment`)  
   - Decision: payment can start only when:  
     - **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** has succeeded, and  
     - for high-value claims, **Senior_Auditor_Review** is completed, and  
     - a signed **BankTransferAuthorization** is present.
