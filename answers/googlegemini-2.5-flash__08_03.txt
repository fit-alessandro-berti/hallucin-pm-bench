Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3** in a reachable marking.

To enable T5, tokens are required on places `pd` and `pe`.
To enable T3, a token is required on place `pc`.

We can enable T5 without T3 firing. Here's a shortest firing sequence:

1.  **T1** fires (consumes `p0`, produces `pa` and `pb`).
    *   Current Marking: `{pa:1, pb:1}`
2.  **T2b** fires (consumes `pa`, produces `pd`). This is the "shortcut" path for `pd`, skipping `pc` and thus `T3`.
    *   Current Marking: `{pb:1, pd:1}`
3.  **T4** fires (consumes `pb`, produces `pe`).
    *   Current Marking: `{pd:1, pe:1}`

At this point, `pd` and `pe` both have tokens, so **T5** is enabled. Transition **T3** has not fired because no token has been placed on `pc` (only `T2` can produce `pc`, and `T2` was not fired; `T2b` fired instead).

Thus, T5 can fire after this sequence, and T3 has not fired.

**Shortest firing sequence to enable T5 before T3 fires:**

T1, T2b, T4
