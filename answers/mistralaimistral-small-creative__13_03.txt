1️⃣ **Answer**: The exact activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt.

---
2️⃣ **Explanation (≤120 words)**:
This snippet is **too small** to generalize. The excerpt shows **only 3 cases (1001–1003)** out of a full month’s data, with **one manual fraud check** (Case 1002). However:
- **Sampling bias**: The cases may not represent the full distribution (e.g., 1002 could be an outlier).
- **Missing context**: The log may include **other cases with manual checks** (e.g., later timestamps or different CaseIDs).
- **Activity naming inconsistencies**: The excerpt shows **"Manual Fraud Check"** (Case 1002) but **"Fraud Check (Automatic)"** (Case 1003), suggesting **variability in naming conventions**—an analyst might overlook synonyms (e.g., "Manual Fraud Review") or misclassify partial matches.
- **Temporal trends**: Manual checks might **cluster in specific periods** (e.g., end-of-month spikes) not captured here.

**Conclusion**: A single snippet risks **under/overestimating** prevalence due to **limited scope, naming noise, and potential temporal patterns**.
