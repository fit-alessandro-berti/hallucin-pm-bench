**Rule 1 (satisfied)**: QE occurs once (position 3) and RA occurs once (position 5), with QE before RA.  
**Rule 2 (satisfied)**: Severity is "High", and VP (position 6) occurs after both QE and RA.  
**Rule 3 (violated)**: NA (position 4) occurs after QE but before RA, so it does not wait for both to complete.  
**Rule 4 (satisfied)**: CC (position 7) occurs after NA and VP.
