**Q1.** **No.** In every reachable marking, **T5 cannot fire before T3**.

**Q2.** After **T1**, tokens are in **P2** and **P1**. To enable **T5**, we need tokens in **P2** *and* **P5**. The only way to mark **P5** is via **T4**, which requires a token in **P4**. The only ways to produce a token in **P4** are **T3** (from **P2**) or **T7** (from **P3**), and **T7** itself requires **T2**. Therefore, any path that enables **T5** must first create **P4**, hence must execute **T3** or (**T2**, **T7**). So **T5 before T3 is impossible**.
