Decision Points in Acme Bank's Micro-loan Fast-Track process:

• Underwriter Alignment Gate:  
 – If the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤ 2 points, the process continues to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC).  
 – If they differ by more than 2 points, the application is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision, and then the process continues.

• Amount Threshold Decision:  
 – If the requested amount is < €15 000, the system auto-approves the application.  
 – If the requested amount is ≥ €15 000, the application proceeds to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
