**Answer: Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**

### Concrete firing sequence

| Step | Fired transition | Marking after the step (p0,…,p6) |
|------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0    | – (initial)      | (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)           |
| 1    | **T1** : p0 → p1 + p2 | (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) |
| 2    | **T2** : p1 → p3 | (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0) |
| 3    | **T5** : p3 –|p4 → p6 (enabled because p3 = 1, p4 = 0) | (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1) |

After step 2 we have a token in **p3** while **p4** is still empty.  
Hence the inhibitor condition of **T5** (p4 must contain *zero* tokens) is satisfied, and **T5** is enabled.  
Because **T3** has not yet consumed its enabling token from **p2**, we may choose to fire **T5** now – it executes before any occurrence of **T3**.

### Why this is possible

* **T3** is enabled whenever **p2** contains a token.  
  After firing **T1**, **p2** holds a token, but **T3** does **not** depend on any other places.

* **T5** is enabled when **p3 > 0** **and** **p4 = 0**.  
  After the sequence **T1 → T2** we have exactly one token in **p3** and none in **p4**; therefore **T5** becomes enabled **immediately**, i.e. before **T3** ever fires.

Thus a reachable marking exists (the one after step 2) in which **T5** can fire, and we can indeed fire **T5** prior to any firing of **T3**. The inhibitor arc does not prevent this; it only requires that **p4** be empty, which is true at that moment. 

Hence the answer is **yes**, and the three‑step sequence shown above is a concrete proof.
