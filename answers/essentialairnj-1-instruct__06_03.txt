To identify sets of tasks that can execute concurrently in Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment, we look for tasks that run on different branches of the same parallel construct. Here’s the solution:

```python
# Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment (supplier-to-shelf)
# 1. Start
# 2. Receive_Stock
# 3. || Parallel Split #1 ||
#        • Quality_Check
#        • Update_Inventory
# 4. || Merge #1 ||
# 5. Store_Items
# 6. || Parallel Split #2 ||
#        • Generate_Replenishment_Report
#        • Notify_Procurement
# 7. || Merge #2 ||
# 8. End

# Concurrent task sets in Process B - Warehouse_Replenishment:
#          Set 1: Quality_Check, Update_Inventory
concurrent_set_1 = {"Quality_Check", "Update_Inventory"}

#          Set 2: Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement
concurrent_set_2 = {"Generate_Replenishment_Report", "Notify_Procurement"}

# Output:
print("Set 1:", concurrent_set_1)
print("Set 2:", concurrent_set_2)
```

The above code will define and print the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently in Process B of the Warehouse_Replenishment model.
