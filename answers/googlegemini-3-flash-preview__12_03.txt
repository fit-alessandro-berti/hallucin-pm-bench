1. **Answer:** No

2. **Justification:**
The statement is inaccurate based on the provided event log. While the sequence `Receive_Order -> Validate_Payment` does occur in Cases C001 and C003, there are two specific instances that disprove the claim:

*   **Case C002:** The activity `Pack_Items` occurs immediately after `Receive_Order`. In this case, `Validate_Payment` does not occur until after `Pack_Items`, meaning it is not the immediate successor to the order receipt.
*   **Case C004:** The activity `Check_Fraud` occurs immediately after `Receive_Order`. This represents an "intermediate" activity between the receipt and the payment validation, violating the "no other activities in between" portion of the fact.

**Sequences per Case:**
*   **C001:** Receive_Order → **Validate_Payment** (Matches)
*   **C002:** Receive_Order → **Pack_Items** (Violates)
*   **C003:** Receive_Order → **Validate_Payment** (Matches)
*   **C004:** Receive_Order → **Check_Fraud** (Violates)
