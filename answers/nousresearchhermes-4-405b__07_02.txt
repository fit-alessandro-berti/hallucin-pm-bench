**Added tasks:**
1.  **Verify Identity** (task "Task_VerifyIdentity") is added after the "Start" and before "Review Application". Consequently, new sequence flows "Flow_1" (StartEvent_1 → Task_VerifyIdentity) and "Flow_2" (Task_VerifyIdentity → Task_ReviewApplication) are added to connect it.
2.  **Request Additional Documents** (task "Task_RequestDocs") is added with a new sequence flow "Flow_5" branching from the "Gateway_Decision" and leading to "EndEvent_1".
3.  A new sequence flow "Flow_8" (Task_RequestDocs → EndEvent_1) is added to handle the flow from the new task "Request Additional Documents" to the end.

**Removed tasks:**
1.  The original rejection task, **Reject Loan** ("Task_RejectLoan"), is removed from the process. Consequently, its incoming sequence flow "Flow_4" (Gateway_Decision → Task_RejectLoan) and outgoing sequence flow "Flow_6" (Task_RejectLoan → EndEvent_1) are also removed.

**Gateway-type changes:**
1.  The exclusive gateway (bpmn:exclusiveGateway) with the identifier "Gateway_Decision" is changed to an **inclusive gateway** (bpmn:inclusiveGateway). Its name is also updated from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check". This change in gateway type implies more flexible branching logic.
2.  A new sequence flow, **"Flow_6"**, is added from the modified inclusive gateway ("Gateway_Decision") to the new task "Task_FinalReject", labeled "ineligible", replacing the old rejection path.
3.  The original "Flow_4," which previously connected "Gateway_Decision" to "Task_RejectLoan," has its target updated to point to the new task "Task_ApproveLoan," and its name changed to "eligible" (its id remains "Flow_4" but now it points from "Gateway_Decision" to "Task_ApproveLoan").
