Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before **T3**. Here is one shortest firing sequence:

**Sequence:** T1 → T2b → T4 → T5  

### Explanation:
1. **Initial state**: `p0 = 1`, others = 0.  
2. **T1 fires**: Consumes `p0` and produces `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`.  
3. **T2b fires**: Consumes `pa` (now `pa = 0`) and produces `pd = 1`.  
4. **T4 fires**: Consumes `pb` (now `pb = 0`) and produces `pe = 1`.  
5. **T5 fires**: Now `pd = 1` and `pe = 1` are present, so T5 consumes both and produces `pf = 1`.  

In this sequence, **T3 never fires** because `pc` (required for T3) is never produced. The path avoids T2 (which would create `pc`) by taking T2b instead. Thus, T5 fires before T3 in this reachable marking.  

**Shortest sequence length**: 4 transitions.
