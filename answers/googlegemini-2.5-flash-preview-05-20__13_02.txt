Here are the answers based on the provided log excerpt:

1.  The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs 1 time in the excerpt.

2.  a) Percentage of all *events* that include that activity:
    *   Total number of events: 48
    *   Number of events with "Manual_Fraud_Check": 1
    *   (1 / 48) * 100% = 2.08%

    b) Percentage of all *unique cases* that include that activity:
    *   Total number of unique cases: 12
    *   Number of cases with "Manual_Fraud_Check": 1 (Case C05)
    *   (1 / 12) * 100% = 8.33%

3.  A low-support activity like "Manual_Fraud_Check" appearing only once in this log slice can mislead analyses because it creates an artificial bottleneck or unusual path within the observed process. Generalizing from this limited data might suggest it's a rare, highly exceptional step, thereby skewing performance metrics (e.g., cycle time if that specific instance took significantly longer) or impacting predictive models. Its infrequent occurrence here doesn't represent its true frequency or impact in the complete process.
