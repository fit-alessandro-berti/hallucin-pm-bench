The fact is **false**.

In the event-log fragment, the activity "Update_Inventory" does not always occur immediately after "Authorize_Refund." For example:

- In case ID 1003, the activities are as follows:
	1. "Receive_Return"
	2. "Inspect_Item"
	3. "Update_Inventory"
	4. "Quality_Check"
	5. "Authorize_Refund"

Here, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund." Thus, the claim that "Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory" is incorrect.
