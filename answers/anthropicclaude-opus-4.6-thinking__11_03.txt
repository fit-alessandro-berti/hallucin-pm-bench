**Re:** Critical SLA Breaches and Remediation Actions

Three activities stand out as the worst performers when assessed jointly on SLA breach magnitude and excessive waiting time.

**Legal Approval** exceeds its 600s SLA by 300s (50% over), with waiting time of 600s accounting for two-thirds of its throughput time. **Risk Review** breaches its 300s SLA by 300s (100% over), driven by 480s of waiting time—80% of total throughput. **Credit Assessment** surpasses its 240s SLA by 60s (25% over), with 200s of waiting time representing 67% of throughput. These three activities also show notable case attrition, suggesting process abandonment.

**Recommendations:**

- **Legal Approval:** Implement parallel legal review workflows or add capacity to cut the 600s waiting time, targeting at least a 50% reduction to bring throughput within SLA.
- **Risk Review:** Introduce automated pre-screening or risk-scoring triage to reduce the 480s waiting time and prioritize the 480 cases reaching this stage.
- **Credit Assessment:** Deploy rules-based auto-decisioning for straightforward applications to eliminate a portion of the 200s waiting time and achieve SLA compliance.
