**Note:**  
- **Scorecard–C cyan**, **Scorecard–Magenta**, and **Scorecard–Yellow** are consumed as *inputs* in Step 3 and not “produced” by Acme, but they are *required* documents in the process.  
- **Deck Memo** is *conditional*—only required when the Tri-Color-Risk-Check does **not** satisfy the skip condition.  
- All other documents are universally required regardless of path.
