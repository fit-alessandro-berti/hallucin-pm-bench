Yes, it is possible.  
**Shortest firing sequence**: `T1 → T2b → T4 → T5`  

### Explanation:  
1. **Initial marking**: `p0 = 1` (others `0`).  
2. **T1 fires**:  
   - Consumes `p0`, produces `pa` and `pb`.  
   - New marking: `pa=1`, `pb=1`, others `0`.  
3. **T2b fires**:  
   - Consumes `pa`, produces `pd`.  
   - New marking: `pd=1`, `pb=1`, others `0` (except `pa=0`).  
4. **T4 fires**:  
   - Consumes `pb`, produces `pe`.  
   - New marking: `pd=1`, `pe=1`, others `0` (except `pb=0`).  
5. **T5 fires**:  
   - Consumes `pd` and `pe`, produces `pf`.  
   - `T3` was **never fired** (since `pc` was never populated via `T2`).  

In this path, `T5` fires **before** `T3` because `T3` is bypassed entirely (via `T2b` instead of `T2`). The marking where `T5` fires (`pd=1`, `pe=1`) does not require `T3` to have fired.  

### Why no other path allows `T5` before `T3`:  
- To fire `T3`, `pc` must have a token (from `T2`).  
- If `T3` fires, `pd` is incremented, but `T5` still needs `pe` (from `T4`).  
- In all paths where `T3` fires, `T5` **must** fire **after** `T3` (since `T3` is required to populate `pd`).  

Thus, the only way for `T5` to precede `T3` is by avoiding `T3` entirely (via `T2b`).
