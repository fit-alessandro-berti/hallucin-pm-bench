**Answer to Question 1:** No.  

**Answer to Question 2 (bonus):** T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. P5 is marked only after T4 fires, which consumes a token from P4. P4 receives a token either via T7 (from P3) or T3 (from P2). However, P2 is initially marked by T1, but T3 consumes P2’s token to produce P4. Thus, T3 must fire to enable P4 → T4 → T5. Without T3 firing, P4 is unmarked, so T4 and subsequently T5 cannot fire. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3. The synchronizing join at T5 depends on the path through T3 (or T7+T4), but T3 is essential to consume P2’s token and enable downstream flow. Hence, no such sequence exists.
