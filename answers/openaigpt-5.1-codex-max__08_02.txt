Yes. After the initial split, you can carry the P2 token along untouched while you create P5 via the P1 branch. For example:

- \(T1\): consume \(P0\), produce \(P1,P2\).
- \(T2\): consume \(P1\), produce \(P3\).
- \(T7\): consume \(P3\), produce \(P4\).
- \(T4\): consume \(P4\), produce \(P5\).
- \(T5\): consume \(P2,P5\), produce \(P6\).

Here \(T5\) fires without \(T3\) ever having occurred. There’s no precedence constraint forcing \(T3\) before \(T5\).
