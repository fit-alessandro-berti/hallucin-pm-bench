### Answer

**Question 1:** No.

**Question 2 (bonus):** T5 cannot fire before T3. T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. P5 is only produced by T4, which needs a token in P4. P4 is produced either by T3 (from P2) or T7 (from P3). Since T3 produces P4 from P2, T3 must fire before T4 and therefore before T5. Thus, T5 cannot precede T3 in any reachable marking.
