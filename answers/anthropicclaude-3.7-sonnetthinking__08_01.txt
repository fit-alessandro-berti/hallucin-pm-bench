# Analysis of T5 Firing Before T3

## Answer: YES, T5 can fire before T3

### Concrete Firing Sequence
Starting with the initial marking M₀ = (1,0,0,0,0,0,0):

1. Fire T1: p0 → p1 + p2
   * New marking: (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)
   
2. Fire T2: p1 → p3
   * New marking: (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)
   
3. **At this point, T5 can fire before T3**
   * T5 requires: token in p3 (✓) AND zero tokens in p4 (✓)
   * Fire T5: p3 → p6
   * Final marking: (0,0,1,0,0,0,1)

### Justification
This sequence is possible because:
1. After T1 fires, both p1 and p2 receive tokens (parallel split)
2. When T2 fires, p3 gets a token while p4 remains empty
3. T5's preconditions are satisfied at this point:
   - p3 has a token (normal arc requirement)
   - p4 has zero tokens (inhibitor arc requirement)

Therefore, we can execute T5 before T3 in a reachable marking of this Petri net.
