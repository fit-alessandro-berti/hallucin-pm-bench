In case C003, Validate_Payment occurs first (line 6) and Receive_Order comes later (line 7), so it does not “follow” it; in case C005, Validate_Payment appears (line 11) but Receive_Order never appears at all. These two counter-examples show that Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order in the provided log fragment.
