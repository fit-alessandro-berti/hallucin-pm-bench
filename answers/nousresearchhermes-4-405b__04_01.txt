Non-compliant. Rule 2 was violated because Expedite_Flag (row 4) was present, but Risk_Assessment (row 9) occurred after the first Ship_Goods (row 8), not before it. Also, Rule 3 was broken since Three_way_match (row 10) appeared two positions after Goods_Received (row 6) with two intervening activities (Move_to_Quality and Ship_Goods), exceeding the maximum allowed distance of 2. Finally, Rule 5 was breached because the trace contained activity Archive_Record in row 11 without any subsequent events.
