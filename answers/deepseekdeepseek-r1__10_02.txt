**Notes**:  
- Tasks 5 and 8 include dependencies: the Transaction Analyst informs IT Support to trigger SWIFT (task 6), and IT Support informs the Regulatory Liaison post-archival (task 8).  
- Vocabulary compliance:  
  - “KYC Review” replaces “customer due diligence/CDD.”  
  - Roles align with mandated terms (no “compliance officer” or “payment clerk”).  
- IT Support is retained for clarity (non-mandated role but not prohibited).  
- RACI roles are strictly limited to process participants as per the source text.
