No, the fact is inaccurate based on the provided event-log fragment. 

Here is the justification citing the data:
* **Case 1001:** "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs immediately *before* "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02), which is the exact reverse of the claim.
* **Case 1003:** "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) again occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18), and they are not consecutive (separated by "Quality_Check").
* **Case 1002:** "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all within the case. 

Therefore, "Authorize_Refund" never occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" in the given dataset.
