No, it is not possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3** in any reachable marking of this Petri net. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations

1. **Transition T5's Enabledness**:
	- Transition **T5** requires **p3** to have one token and **p4** to have zero tokens (**â€“|p4**) for it to fire.
2. **Transition T3's Execution**:
	- Transition **T3** moves a token from **p2** to **p4**. Until this happens, **p4** remains empty.
3. **Logical Dependency**:
	- To satisfy the inhibitor arc condition of **T5** (p4 has zero tokens), **T3** must not have occurred yet, as it supplies tokens to **p4**.

### Contradiction via Firing Sequence

If **T5** were to fire before **T3**, the marking would violate the preconditions for firing **T3**:

1. If **T5** fires first, the marking would require a token in **p3** and zero tokens in **p4**.
2. However, for **T3** to fire, there must be a token in **p4**, which conflicts with the condition for **T5** to fire.

This contradiction shows that **T5 cannot fire before T3**.

### Conclusion

It is impossible for **T5** to fire before **T3**. Transition **T3** must execute first to provide the necessary tokens for **p4** and satisfy the inhibitor arc condition of **T5**.
