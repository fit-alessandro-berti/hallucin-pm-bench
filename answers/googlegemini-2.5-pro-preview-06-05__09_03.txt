It is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity from the supplied artefacts.

To compute the cycle time for any single activity, the `start_time` and `complete_time` for that specific event are required. An average would then require these data points for all instances of the activity in the log. As stated in the description for Artefact A, every row and every timestamp value has been redacted from the event log. Without this fundamental event data, no duration-based metrics can be calculated. The information in Artefact B describes a different metric (throughput time between two activities) and an overall process SLA, neither of which can be used to derive the cycle time of a single activity.
