I need to analyze whether T5 can fire before T3 in any reachable marking of this Petri net.

Let me trace through the possible states:

**Initial marking:** p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

From the initial marking:
- Only T1 is enabled (requires p0)
- T1 fires: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

After T1 fires:
- T2 is enabled (requires p1)
- T3 is enabled (requires p2)
- T4 is NOT enabled (requires both p3 and p4)
- T5 is NOT enabled (requires p3, and p4 must be empty)

Now I'll check if we can reach a state where T5 is enabled before T3 fires:

**Path 1: Fire T2 first**
- T2 fires: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
- Now T5 IS enabled! (p3 has a token and p4 is empty)
- T3 is still enabled (requires p2)

So we can fire T5 before T3 with the sequence: T1 → T2 → T5

**Answer: YES**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Concrete firing sequence:** T1 → T2 → T5

**Justification:** After T1 fires (parallel split), both p1 and p2 receive tokens. If we fire T2 first, it produces a token in p3. At this point, T5 becomes enabled because:
1. p3 contains a token (normal arc requirement satisfied)
2. p4 contains zero tokens (inhibitor arc requirement satisfied)

Since T3 has not fired yet, p4 remains empty, allowing T5 to fire before T3.
