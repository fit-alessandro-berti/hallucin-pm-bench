Okay, here is a summary of Acme Bank's small-business loan approval process as described.

**a) Decision Points**

1.  **Conditional Branch:** This decision point determines whether a loan application skips the manual underwriting review based on its risk rating and requested amount. The rule is: If the risk is Low or Medium AND the requested amount is €250,000 or less, skip Manual Underwriting Review.
2.  **Decision Gate "TriVote":** This decision point determines whether the application proceeds after the reviews. The rule is: The application passes if any two of the three required officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) provide approval.
