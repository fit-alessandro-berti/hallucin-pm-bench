1. **No**

2. **Justification:**  
The statement is incorrect because there are instances in the log where **“Validate_Payment” does not occur immediately after “Receive_Order.”** Specifically:

- In **Case C001**, the sequence is:  
  `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  This is consistent with the claim.

- In **Case C002**, the sequence is:  
  `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  Here, **“Validate_Payment” occurs after “Pack_Items,” not immediately after “Receive_Order.”**

- In **Case C003**, the sequence is:  
  `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order`  
  This supports the claim.

- In **Case C004**, the sequence is:  
  `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  In this case, **“Check_Fraud” occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment,”** directly contradicting the claim.

Since **Case C002** and **Case C004** clearly violate the stated rule, the **FACT is inaccurate** with respect to the event-log excerpt.
