To comply with the 48-hour SLA, introduce a **timer event** at the "Task_Receive" activity (element id: Task_Receive) with a 48-hour duration. If the "Triage Claim" event (id: Task_Triage) is not reached within this window, the process should automatically transition to an "Escalation" gateway, triggering the required auto-escalation behavior without adding new tasks. This uses existing elements and enforces the time constraint via a timer event.
