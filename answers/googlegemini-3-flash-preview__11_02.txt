**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process Performance Analyst  
**Date:** Q1-2025 Performance Review  
**Subject:** Claims Handling Process Optimization

Analysis of Q1 data identifies three critical bottlenecks hindering operational efficiency:

1.  **Request Documents:** This is the primary process constraint. It suffers from an excessive **22.0% rework rate** and a significant **150-minute wait time**.  
    *   *Action:* Implement an automated document validation checklist at the point of submission to reduce cyclical "back-and-forth" requests.

2.  **Review Documents:** This activity shows the highest delivery risk with a **12.4% SLA breach rate** and high variability (**9-minute StDev**). The complexity here suggests a capacity mismatch.  
    *   *Action:* Deploy senior adjusters to stabilize the high standard deviation or introduce AI-assisted OCR to speed up manual extraction.

3.  **Initial Assessment:** While throughput is high, the **18-minute wait time** and **4-minute StDev** indicate early-stage processing friction.  
    *   *Action:* Evaluate resource allocation during peak hours to smooth queueing delays and standardize assessment criteria.

Total throughput drops from 280 to 179 cases by the final stage. Addressing the **Request/Review Documents** cycle is mandatory to recover the lost 35% processing capacity.
