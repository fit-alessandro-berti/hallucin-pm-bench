# EXECUTIVE MEMO

TO: Chief Operating Officer, Orion Credit
FROM: Senior Process-Performance Analyst
SUBJECT: Critical Process Bottlenecks Requiring Immediate Attention

Our analysis reveals three critical activities significantly breaching SLAs due to excessive waiting times:

Risk Review exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (100% over target), with waiting time comprising 480 seconds (80% of total processing time). Only 480 of 1175 credit-assessed applications proceed to this stage.

Legal Approval exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (50% over target), with customers waiting 600 seconds before processing begins, representing 67% of total activity time.

Credit Assessment exceeds SLA by 60 seconds (25% over target), with 200 seconds spent in queue before assessment starts.

Recommended actions:

• Risk Review: Implement dedicated fast-track assessment for low/medium-risk applications to reduce the 480-second queue time.
• Legal Approval: Develop parallel processing capability to reduce the 600-second waiting period.
• Credit Assessment: Introduce automated pre-screening to reduce the 200-second waiting time.
