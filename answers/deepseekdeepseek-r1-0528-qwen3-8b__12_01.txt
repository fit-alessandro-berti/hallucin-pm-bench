**Answer:** No, the fact is inaccurate.

**Justification:** Based on the provided event log:
*   **Case 1001**: `Authorize_Refund` is followed by `Refund_Issued`.
*   **Case 1002**: `Authorize_Refund` is followed by `Refund_Issued`.
*   **Case 1003**: `Update_Inventory` occurs *before* `Authorize_Refund`, it is not after it.

The data shows `Authorize_Refund` does not occur immediately before `Update_Inventory` in any case within this fragment. In fact, the event log does not contain any occurrence of `Authorize_Refund` followed immediately by `Update_Inventory`.
