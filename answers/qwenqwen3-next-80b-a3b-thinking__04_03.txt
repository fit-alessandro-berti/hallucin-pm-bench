No. Rule 3 is violated: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), but rule 3 requires NA to happen only after **both** QE and RA are complete. In this trace, NA (step 4) occurs after QE (step 3) but before RA (step 5), which violates rule 3. Rule 1 is satisfied (QE before RA), rule 2 is satisfied (VP after QE/RA for High severity), and rule 4 is satisfied (CC after NA/VP), but the NA-RA order failure makes the trace non-compliant.
