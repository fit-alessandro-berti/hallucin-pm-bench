To ensure SLA compliance, add a **boundary timer event** to the "Request Missing Docs" task (Task_RequestDocs). This timer should trigger after 48 hours from claim submission and connect directly to "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage) via a new sequence flow.

This modification ensures that even if documentation remains incomplete, the claim automatically escalates to triage within the required timeframe. The timer would be non-interrupting, allowing the document request to continue while the claim proceeds to triage in parallel.

Implementation: Attach a non-interrupting timer boundary event to Task_RequestDocs with a 48-hour duration, creating a new sequence flow from this event to Task_Triage. This guarantees all claims reach triage within SLA while maintaining the original process flow for complete documentation scenarios.
