**No.**

The claim is incorrect because there are two instances where *Validate_Payment* does not follow *Receive_Order*. In case C002 (lines 3–5), *Check_Inventory* occurs between *Receive_Order* (line 3) and *Validate_Payment* (line 5). Additionally, in case C003 (lines 6–7), *Validate_Payment* (line 6) precedes *Receive_Order* (line 7). Thus, the claim does not hold for these two cases.
