**Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance & Recommendations**

**To: COO**
**From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst**

Q1-2025 data for the Claims Handling process indicates several areas requiring attention. The three worst-performing activities and recommended actions are:

1.  **Request_Documents:** This activity is a major bottleneck, evidenced by the highest `avg_wait_time_min` (150 min), causing a significant throughput drop (from 270 to 190 cases/day). It also has the highest `rework_rate_pct` at 22.0%.
    *   **Action:** Implement standardized document request templates to address the 22.0% rework rate and reduce associated delays stemming from unclear or incomplete initial requests.

2.  **Review_Documents:** This activity shows the highest `avg_processing_time_min` (25 min) and the highest `sla_breach_pct` (12.4%). The high `stdev_processing_time_min` (9 min) also indicates inconsistency.
    *   **Action:** Provide targeted training for reviewers focusing on complex cases to reduce the high average processing time, variability, and subsequent SLA breaches.

3.  **Initial_Assessment:** Performance is impacted by the third-highest `avg_wait_time_min` (18 min) and a notable `sla_breach_pct` of 3.2%.
    *   **Action:** Review and potentially increase resource allocation for Initial Assessment to alleviate the 18-minute average wait time and thereby reduce SLA breach risk.
