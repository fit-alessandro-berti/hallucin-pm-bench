3. Low-support activities like "Manual_Fraud_Check" can skew performance or predictive analyses if generalized from this log because they occur infrequently. Their irregular presence can suggest anomalies or special conditions, potentially indicating exceptions rather than the norm. If these activities are rare in the dataset, they might not be well-represented in models, leading to inaccurate predictions or performance assessments. Furthermore, such activities could disproportionately affect metrics like average processing time or fraud detection rates, misleading stakeholders about typical process behavior.
