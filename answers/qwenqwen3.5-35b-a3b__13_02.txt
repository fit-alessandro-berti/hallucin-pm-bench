3. This activity occurs once in 48 events (2.08%). Generalizing risks overfitting C05’s context to all cases. With 11 of 12 cases using `Auto_Fraud_Check`, the sample lacks variance to validate manual review rules. Models might incorrectly treat C05’s features as universal. Performance metrics derived here misrepresent efficiency, as one instance cannot reflect population behavior. This scarcity prevents distinguishing genuine exceptions from noise. Consequently, predictive analyses and performance evaluations based on this slice will lack statistical reliability, skewing insights regarding manual fraud handling strategies versus the dominant automated workflow.
