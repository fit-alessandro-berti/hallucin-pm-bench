No, the fact is false.  
• Case 1001: “Update_Inventory” happens first, followed by “Authorize_Refund” (order is reversed, and they are **not** adjacent).  
• Case 1002: “Update_Inventory” never occurs, so “Authorize_Refund” cannot be immediately before it.  
• Case 1003: “Update_Inventory” is followed by “Quality_Check” and only then “Authorize_Refund” (again, order reversed and not adjacent).

Since in every observed case “Authorize_Refund” is either after “Update_Inventory” or the latter is missing, the claimed pattern never occurs in this fragment.
