**Decision Points in Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** (Step 5)  
   – If the two independent risk scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues to the Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC).  
   – If the difference is **> 2 points**, the application is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie‑break decision; after the decision, the process proceeds to NFC.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision** (Step 7)  
   – If the requested loan amount is **< €15 000**, the system **auto‑approves** and proceeds directly to fund disbursement.  
   – If the amount is **≥ €15 000**, the application moves to the Micro‑loan Board Approval.

3. **Final Micro‑loan Board Approval (MBA)** (Step 8)  
   – The board votes to **approve** or **reject** the loan. Approved applications go to fund disbursement.
