Yes.

One shortest firing sequence with T5 before T3:
T1, T2b, T4, T5

Justification of minimality:
- T1 is needed to create pa and pb.
- T2b (from pa) and T4 (from pb) are both needed to produce pd and pe, respectively.
- No single transition yields both pd and pe, so at least two firings after T1 are required before T5 can fire.
Thus T5 can first occur on the 4th firing, before any T3.
