**No**

The claim is false. Case C003 shows *Validate_Payment* (line 6, timestamp 10:43:00Z) occurring **before** *Receive_Order* (line 7, timestamp 10:45:00Z), with only 2 minutes separating them. Additionally, Case C005 contains *Validate_Payment* (line 11) without any *Receive_Order* event at all, further demonstrating that *Validate_Payment* does not universally follow *Receive_Order*.
