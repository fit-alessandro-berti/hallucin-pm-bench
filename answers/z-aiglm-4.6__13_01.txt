**1.** The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in the fragment.

**2.** This represents **5.56 %** of all logged events (1 ÷ 18 × 100 ≈ 5.56 %, rounded to two decimal places).

**3.** The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

**4.** Two sampling‑related reasons why estimating the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks from this fragment alone is unreliable:

1. **Very small sample size** – only 18 events (4 cases) are observed, which yields high statistical variability and a low‑confidence estimate for a monthly rate.  
2. **Limited time window** – the data span a few hours on a single day; they do not capture daily, weekly, or seasonal patterns that could affect how often fraud checks are performed, so the sample is not temporally representative.
