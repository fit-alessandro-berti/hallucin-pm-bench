**Memo: Performance Analytics Commentary for Q1-2025 Claims Handling**

The following activities underperformed in Q1-2025:

1. Check Coverage
	- **Why:** Its rework rate (0.6%) is second-highest, despite the highest variability in processing time (stdev: 3 min).
	- **Recommendation:** Standardize decision-making criteria to reduce variability and rework.
2. Request Documents
	- **Why:** Its processing time variability is second-highest (stdev: 1 min) while workload is high (190 cases/day).
	- **Recommendation:** Automate data retrieval for frequent cases to reduce queueing and execution times.
3. Review Documents
	- **Why:** The highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) among activities, coupled with long processing (25 min avg) and significant variability (stdev: 9 min).
	- **Recommendation:** Prioritize resources for high-complexity document reviews to improve consistency and reduce breaches.

This analysis highlights opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce SLA breaches by reducing variability, automating repetitive tasks, and focusing resources strategically.
