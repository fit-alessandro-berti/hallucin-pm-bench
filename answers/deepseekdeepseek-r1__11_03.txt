Three activities severely underperform on both SLA compliance and waiting times:  

1. **Risk Review**  
   - Exceeds SLA by **300s** (600s vs. 300s target).  
   - 80% of throughput time is waiting (480s), indicating critical resource shortages.  

2. **Legal Approval**  
   - Exceeds SLA by **300s** (900s vs. 600s target).  
   - 67% of throughput time is waiting (600s), suggesting chronic backlogs.  

3. **Credit Assessment**  
   - Exceeds SLA by **60s** (300s vs. 240s target).  
   - 67% of throughput time is waiting (200s), revealing inefficient prioritization.  

**Recommendations**  
- **Risk Review:** Immediately allocate additional full-time reviewers to reduce queuing delays, targeting a 50% waiting-time reduction.  
- **Legal Approval:** Implement parallel processing for standard clauses to cut approval time by aligning with the 300s processing baseline.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Introduce triage protocols to fast-track low-risk cases, leveraging existing capacity to lower waiting time by 25%.  

These actions address root causes quantified in current data and prioritize SLA adherence.
