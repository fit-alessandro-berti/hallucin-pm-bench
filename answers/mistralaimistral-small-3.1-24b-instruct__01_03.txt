### a) Decision Points

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check Decision**:
   - The outcome of the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, combined with the requested loan amount, determines whether to skip the Manual-Underwriting-Review.

2. **Skip Manual-Underwriting-Review Decider**:
   - If the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is ≤ €250,000, then the process skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review.

3. **TriVote Decision Gate**:
   - Requires any two out of the three approvals from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer to pass.
