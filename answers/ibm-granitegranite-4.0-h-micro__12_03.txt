No.

The FACT is inaccurate because there are instances where "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order". 

For example, in CaseID C004:
- "Receive_Order" occurred at 2025-01-03T10:05:00
- "Validate_Payment" occurred at 2025-01-03T10:20:00

There is a gap of 15 minutes between these two activities, indicating that "Validate_Payment" does not always follow "Receive_Order" without any other activities in between.
