### **Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

To determine the number of distinct cases, we examine the `case` attribute in each event:

1. C001  
2. C002  
3. C001  
4. C003  
5. C002  
6. C003  
7. C001  
8. C002  
9. C003  
10. C002  

The distinct case IDs are: **C001, C002, C003**

**Answer: 3**

### **Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

We filter events for case **C002** and list activities in chronological order based on the `time:timestamp`:

- Event 2: `Receive_Order` @ 2025-03-01T09:15:10  
- Event 5: `Check_Stock` @ 2025-03-01T09:22:55  
- Event 8: `Arrange_Delivery` @ 2025-03-01T10:15:20  
- Event 10: `Ship_Order` @ 2025-03-01T10:25:40  

**Sequence:**  
`Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`

**Answer:**  
`Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`

---

### **Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**

We look for all events where an activity is immediately followed by `Ship_Order`. We examine the log in chronological order and check for activity transitions.

Let’s go through each case:

#### Case C001:
- `Receive_Order` → `Check_Stock` → `Ship_Order`  
  → `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order`

#### Case C002:
- `Receive_Order` → `Check_Stock` → `Arrange_Delivery` → `Ship_Order`  
  → `Arrange_Delivery` precedes `Ship_Order`

#### Case C003:
- `Receive_Order` → `Check_Stock` → `Ship_Order`  
  → `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order`

So the activities that immediately precede `Ship_Order` are:
- `Check_Stock` (in C001 and C003)
- `Arrange_Delivery` (in C002)

These are the **distinct** activities that directly precede `Ship_Order`.

Now list them **alphabetically**:

- `Arrange_Delivery`
- `Check_Stock`

**Answer:**  
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
