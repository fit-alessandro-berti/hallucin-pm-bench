### Answers

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occur in this fragment?**  
   **1**  
   *Explanation: The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears exactly once in the log (in Case A1002 at 2025-05-01T10:50:00).*

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
   **5.88%**  
   *Explanation: Total logged events = 17 (excluding the header). Occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check" = 1. Percentage = (1 / 17) × 100 = 5.88235... ≈ 5.88% (rounded to two decimal places).*

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  
   **A1002**  
   *Explanation: Only Case A1002 includes the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" (at 2025-05-01T10:50:00).*

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give *two* sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   **1. Extremely small sample size (only 4 cases)** – The fragment contains just 4 cases, which is insufficient to reliably estimate the frequency of a rare event like manual fraud checks (observed in only 1 case). Small samples yield high sampling variability and large confidence intervals.  
   **2. Non-representative temporal coverage (single day only)** – The log covers only one calendar day (May 1, 2025). Manual fraud checks may vary by day-of-week, business volume, or monthly cycles (e.g., higher during holidays or month-end), making this single-day snapshot unrepresentative of a full month.
