**No**

Justification:  
The FACT claims that “Validate_Payment” always occurs immediately after “Receive_Order,” with no other activities in between. However, this is not true for all cases in the log.

- **CaseID C002**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment`  
  → “Validate_Payment” is **not** immediately after “Receive_Order”; “Pack_Items” occurs in between.

- **CaseID C004**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment`  
  → “Validate_Payment” is **not** immediately after “Receive_Order”; “Check_Fraud” occurs in between.

Thus, in both C002 and C004, “Validate_Payment” does **not** follow “Receive_Order” immediately. Therefore, the FACT is **incorrect**.
