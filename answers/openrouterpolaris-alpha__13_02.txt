3. Explanation (≤100 words):
A rare activity like Manual_Fraud_Check can distort conclusions when generalised. Performance metrics (e.g., mean throughput time) may be skewed if this outlier path is aggregated with standard paths, masking typical behavior or falsely suggesting bottlenecks. Predictive models trained on such sparse evidence risk overfitting: they may learn unreliable rules about when fraud checks occur or how they impact outcomes. In this small slice, its low frequency means it is not statistically representative.
