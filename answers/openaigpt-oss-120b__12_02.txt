No.  

In case C003 (lines 6–7) the **Validate_Payment** event occurs at line 6 before the **Receive_Order** event at line 7, violating the claimed ordering. Additionally, case C005 (line 11) has a **Validate_Payment** event with no preceding **Receive_Order** at all. Therefore, **Validate_Payment** does not always follow **Receive_Order** in the presented fragment.
