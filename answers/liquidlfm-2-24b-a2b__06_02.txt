1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware  
4. Dry_Fit_Assembly (after P1 completes)  
5. (Optional: If considering post-inspection parallelism, but per description, no explicit parallel block after Final_Inspection)  

**Note:** Only the explicitly parallel blocks (P1, P2, P3) are listed as concurrent. The sequential steps (e.g., after P1, after P2, after P3) are not included unless explicitly stated as parallel.
