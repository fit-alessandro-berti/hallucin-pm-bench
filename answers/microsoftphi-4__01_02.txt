### Decision Points in Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**:  
   - If the scores assigned by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by **≤ 2 points**, proceed to step 6.  
   - If scores differ by more than 2 points, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**:  
   - If the micro-loan amount is **< €15 000**, the process auto-approves.  
   - If the amount is **≥ €15 000**, proceed to the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**:  
   - The board votes either *approve* or *reject* for amounts **≥ €15 000**.
