1) No.

2) Justification (cite sequences by CaseID):
- C001: Receive_Order at 09:12 → Validate_Payment at 09:15. No other activity between, so it is immediate for this case.
- C002: Receive_Order at 09:30 → Pack_Items at 09:50 → Validate_Payment at 10:05. There is Pack_Items between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, so not immediate.
- C003: Receive_Order at 09:40 → Validate_Payment at 09:44. No other activity between, so immediate for this case.
- C004: Receive_Order at 10:05 → Check_Fraud at 10:07 → Validate_Payment at 10:20. There is Check_Fraud between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, so not immediate.

The log contains both immediate and non-immediate instances of Validate_Payment following Receive_Order, so the statement is not accurate.
