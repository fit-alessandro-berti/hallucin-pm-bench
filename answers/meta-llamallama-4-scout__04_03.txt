## Step 1: Review the given ruleset R and understand the requirements.
The ruleset R for medical-device recall handling has four key rules:
1. Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur once each and in that order.
2. If the case severity is "High", `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen after both QE and RA.
3. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until after QE and RA are complete.
4. `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only after NA (and, if required, after VP).

## 2: Analyze the given execution trace for compliance with rule 1.
The trace given is: `<create_case, capture_event_details, Quality_Engineer_Review, Notify_Authorities, Regulatory_Affairs_Review, VP_Safety_Approval, Close_Case>`.
- QE occurs before RA, which satisfies the order requirement of rule 1.
- Both QE and RA occur once each, satisfying the occurrence requirement of rule 1.

## 3: Check compliance with rule 2, considering the case attribute `severity = "High"`.
Given that the severity is "High", VP must happen after both QE and RA.
- QE and RA occur in that order, and VP occurs after both, satisfying rule 2.

## 4: Evaluate compliance with rule 3.
NA must not occur until after QE and RA are complete.
- However, in the trace, `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), which violates rule 3.

## 5: Assess compliance with rule 4, if necessary.
Since rule 3 is already violated, and NA occurs before RA, we can conclude the trace is not compliant without deeply evaluating rule 4. However, note that CC occurs after VP and NA, which would be necessary for compliance with rule 4 if NA and VP were correctly ordered.

## 6: Conclusion on compliance.
Given the violation of rule 3, the trace is not compliant with ruleset R.

The answer is No.
