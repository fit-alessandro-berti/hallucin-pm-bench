**Answer 1:**  
Yes, **T5 can fire before T3** in some reachable markings.

**Explanation:**  
- T1 fires first: M0 → {P1, P2}  
- T2 fires: {P1} → {P3}  
- Now, P2 is still present, so T5 can fire: {P2, P5} → {P6} (even if P5 is not yet present, T5 can fire if both P2 and P5 are present; but here, P5 is not yet produced, so T5 cannot fire yet).  
- However, after T1, T3 can fire: {P2} → {P4}  
- But to fire T5 before T3, we need both P2 and P5 present.  
- T5 requires both P2 and P5.  
- T1: {P0} → {P1, P2}  
- T2: {P1} → {P3}  
- T4: {P4} → {P5} (but P4 is not yet present)  
- So, **T5 cannot fire before T3** unless P5 is present, which requires T4 (P4 → P5).  
- T4 needs P4, which needs T7 (P3 → P4), which needs T2 (P1 → P3).  
- So, to get P5, you must go through T2 → T7 → T4.  
- T5 needs both P2 and P5.  
- P2 is available after T1.  
- P5 is available only after T4.  
- So, **T5 can only fire after T4, which requires T2, T7, T4**.  
- T3 can fire after T1 (P2 available).  
- But T5 cannot fire before T3 unless P5 is present, which requires T4, which requires T2, T7, T4.  
- So, **T5 cannot fire before T3** in any reachable marking.

**Answer 2 (bonus):**  
**No**, because T5 requires both P2 and P5. P2 is available after T1, but P5 is only available after T4 (which requires T2, T7, T4). So, T5 can only fire after T4, which requires T2, T7, T4. T3 can fire after T1. Thus, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.
