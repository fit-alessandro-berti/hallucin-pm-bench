Subject: SLA and waiting-time hotspots in the credit process

Reviewing average throughput time against Target_SLA and considering average waiting time, the three worst-performing activities are those with the largest SLA overruns and substantial queues. **Legal Approval** averages 900s throughput vs a 600s SLA, exceeding SLA by **300s**, with **600s** average waiting time across **465** cases. **Risk Review** averages 600s throughput vs a 300s SLA, exceeding SLA by **300s**, with **480s** average waiting time across **480** cases. **Credit Assessment** averages 300s throughput vs a 240s SLA, exceeding SLA by **60s**, with **200s** average waiting time across **1175** cases.

These three steps combine the most material SLA breaches with the highest waiting times, indicating capacity or handoff constraints that are dominating customer-cycle performance.

- Legal Approval: reduce the average waiting time (600s) by prioritizing Legal Approval work for the 465 cases, since the queue is twice the SLA overrun (300s).  
- Risk Review: lower the 480s waiting time by fast-tracking Risk Review cases, targeting the queue that drives the full 300s SLA breach.  
- Credit Assessment: focus on cutting the 200s waiting time for the 1175 cases to recover the 60s SLA gap quickly at highest volume.
