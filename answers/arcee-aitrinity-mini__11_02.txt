*Re: Performance Analysis of Claims Handling Processes – Q1 2025*  

Three activities underperformed against KPIs:  

1.  **Request_Documents**:  
    *Why*: Highest wait time (150 min), lowest throughput (190), and extreme rework rate (22%).  
    *Action*: Cancel workflow bottlenecks via root-cause analysis to reduce processing delays.  

2.  **Review_Documents**:  
    *Why*: Longest wait time (30 min), lowest throughput (185), and highest rework (5.3%) and SLA breach (12.4%) rates.  
    *Action*: Audit document standards to align with reviewer efficiency and SLA expectations.  

3.  **Calculate_Payout**:  
    *Why*: Lowest throughput (181) and highest SLA breach (1.2%) despite moderate wait times.  
    *Action*: Implement real-time anomaly detection to prevent systematic delays.  

Data does not distinguish *Approve_Claim* (182 throughput, 0.9% SLA breach) from peers.
