We cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for activity "Approve Invoice" because the event log (Artefact A) contains only column names—all rows and timestamp values have been redacted. No actual data points are available to perform the calculations. The SLA catalogue (Artefact B) provides aggregate metrics about different process aspects (e.g., time from Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice) but does not supply the raw event‑level timestamps required for the requested statistics. Without access to the underlying event log, it is impossible to compute any of these measures.
