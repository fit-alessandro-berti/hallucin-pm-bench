I cannot calculate the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95 % confidence interval for the “Approve Invoice” activity because the event‑log (Artifact A) contains no actual rows or timestamps. Without the concrete start and complete times for each “Approve Invoice” case, there is no data from which to derive durations, variability, or confidence bounds. Consequently, any numeric result would be purely speculative and not based on the supplied artefacts.
