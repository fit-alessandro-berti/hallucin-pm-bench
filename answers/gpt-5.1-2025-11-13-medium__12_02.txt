No. In case C003, *Validate_Payment* at line 6 occurs **before** *Receive_Order* at line 7, so it does not follow it. In case C005, *Validate_Payment* at line 11 is not associated with any *Receive_Order* event at all in that case. While cases C001 (lines 1–2), C002 (lines 3–5), and C004 (lines 8–9) do show *Validate_Payment* after *Receive_Order*, the counterexamples in cases C003 and C005 are enough to make the stated fact inaccurate.
