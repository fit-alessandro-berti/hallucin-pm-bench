I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" from the provided information. The event log stub contains only column headers and no actual data rows, including timestamps, case IDs, or activity instances. Without timestamp data (start_time and complete_time) for the "Approve Invoice" activity, it is impossible to calculate cycle times or any related statistical measures. The SLA catalogue provides contextual targets but does not supply the necessary temporal data to perform the required computation.
