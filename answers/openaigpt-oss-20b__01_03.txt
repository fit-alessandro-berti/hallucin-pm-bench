**a) Decision points (gates or conditional branches)**  

| # | Step | Decision point | Rule (one‑sentence) |
|---|------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Step 4 | *Risk‑amount branch* | If the Tri‑Color‑Risk rating is either **Low** or **Medium** **and** the requested loan amount is ≤ €250 000, the process **skips** Manual‑Underwriting‑Review (step 5); otherwise it proceeds to step 5. |
| 2 | Step 6 | *Tri‑Vote approval gate* | The loan can move forward **only if at least two** of the three required sign‑offs—Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer—are obtained; any two approvals are sufficient. |
| 3 | Step 8 | *Applicant confirmation gate* | The workflow continues **only when** the applicant furnishes a **signed Offer Sheet 77** **and** an **ID Matrix Declaration**; absence of either halts the process. |

*(No other explicit gates or conditional branches are defined in the current Acme process.)*
