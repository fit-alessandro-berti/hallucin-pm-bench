We are given a safe Petri net with initial marking:  
p0(1), all others 0.

Transitions:
- T1: p0 → p1 + p2  (consumes p0, produces p1 and p2)
- T2: p1 → p3
- T3: p2 → p4
- T4: p3 + p4 → p5  (synchronizing join)
- T5: p3 –|p4 → p6  (consumes token from p3, **inhibitor arc** from p4 → requires **p4 = 0** to fire)

**Question:** Is it possible for T5 to fire *before* T3?

Let’s analyze step by step.

### Initial marking: [p0=1, others=0]  
Only enabled transition is **T1**, since it consumes the token in p0.  
After firing **T1**: [p1=1, p2=1], all others 0. No other tokens. So now both T2 and T3 are enabled. But note — we want to fire **T5 before T3**. Can we? Let's see what is required for **T5**:  
- Needs a token in **p3** (to consume), and  - Needs **zero tokens in P4** (due to inhibitor arc).So currently after firing only `T1`: - `p2 = 1` ⇒ `T3` can fire, but hasn't yet - `p4 = 0`, good for inhibitor condition of `T5` - but `p3 = 0`, so `T5` is NOT enabled yet!Therefore, to enable `T5`, we must first get a token into `p3`. The only way is via firing of the sequence including at least part of the path through $ \text{T} \rightarrow \text{T} $. Let's try enabling $ \text{T} $ first then $ \text{T} $, without firing $ \text{T}_ $.Sequence idea: Fire \( \text{fire}\): \( M_ : \{ \} \)Now current marking after \( \): \[ \{ \} ,\{ \} ,\{ \} ]\] Now \( \) can fire because \( \) has a token and \( \) has zero tokens — this satisfies the input conditions for \( : consume one from , inhibitor arc means must be empty — which it still is! So yes — at this moment both conditions hold!So let’s write that concrete sequence from start:Step-by-step reachable markings with transitions fired sequentially:\n\n\[ M_ : [ \, ] \\ M_ : [ \, ] \\ M_ : [ \, ] \\ M_ : []\] ✅ This works.\n\nThus,\nAnswer:\n\boxed{yes}
