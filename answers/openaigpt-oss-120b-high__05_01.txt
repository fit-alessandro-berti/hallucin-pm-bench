Add a 48‑hour timer after the “Check Completeness” task so the claim cannot stay stuck in the “Request Missing Docs” loop.  

1. Insert an **intermediate timer event** (e.g., id `Timer_48h`) after `Task_Check`.  
2. Connect `Task_Check` → `Timer_48h` with a new flow (e.g., `f10`).  
3. Set `Timer_48h`’s **timeDuration** to `PT48H`.  
4. Add a flow `f11` from `Timer_48h` directly to `Task_Triage`.  

Now, if missing documents prevent progress, the timer fires after 48 h and forces the case straight to “Triage Claim”, satisfying the SLA without adding any new tasks.
