Based on the provided artefacts, I cannot compute the exact average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity because:

The event log data (Artefact A) has been redacted, showing only column headers without any actual timestamp values. While we can see that start_time and complete_time columns exist which would normally allow calculation of activity durations, the actual data rows needed for these calculations are not available for privacy reasons.

Neither the SLA catalogue (Artefact B) nor any other provided artefact contains information about individual activity durations that could be used for these calculations.
