Non-compliant  

1. **Violation of Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag & Risk_Assessment ordering)**  
   - Rule 2 states: if `Expedite_Flag` occurs, then `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`.  
   - In this trace, `Expedite_Flag` occurs at step 4.  
   - `Ship_Goods` occurs at step 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at step 9.  
   - Therefore, `Risk_Assessment` does **not** occur before `Ship_Goods`, violating Rule 2.

2. **Rule 1 (high-value PO approvals) – Complied with**  
   - `PO_Amount` = €12 300 (> €10 000) triggers the requirement for **two approvals before `Issue_PO`**: one by a *Procurement Officer* and then by the *CFO*.  
   - Step 2: `Approve_PO` by Procurement_Officer.  
   - Step 3: `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO.  
   - Step 5: `Issue_PO` occurs **after** both approvals.  
   - Sequence and roles are correct, so Rule 1 is satisfied.

3. **Rule 3 (Three_way_match after Goods_Received) – Complied with**  
   - After `Goods_Received` at step 6, `Three_way_match` must occur within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2).  
   - Next activities: step 7 (`Move_to_Quality`), step 8 (`Ship_Goods`), step 9 (`Risk_Assessment`), step 10 (`Three_way_match`).  
   - `Three_way_match` is 4 positions after `Goods_Received` → distance = 4 > 2.  
   - Thus Rule 3 is **also violated**.

4. **Rule 4 (CFO followed by Intern) – Complied with**  
   - CFO activity: step 3 (`Approve_PO_CFO`).  
   - Directly following activity: step 4 (`Expedite_Flag`) by System, not Intern.  
   - There is no case where an Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity, so Rule 4 is satisfied.

5. **Rule 5 (trace termination) – Complied with**  
   - Final activity is `Archive_Record` at step 11.  
   - No events follow it.  
   - Rule 5 is satisfied.

Because of the violations of **Rule 2** and **Rule 3**, the overall assessment is: **Non-compliant**.
