## Recommended Improvement: Add a Boundary Timer Event with Escalation

Attach a **non-interrupting boundary timer event** to `Task_RequestDocs` set to trigger at 47 hours from process start (or track elapsed time from `Start_Claim`). When the timer fires, add a sequence flow that bypasses the normal path and connects directly to `Task_Triage`, ensuring the 48-hour SLA is met.

Alternatively, attach an **interrupting boundary timer event** to `Task_Check` or `Task_RequestDocs` that, upon expiration, routes the claim directly to `Task_Triage` via a new sequence flow—effectively auto-escalating stalled claims.

This approach uses only BPMN event constructs (timer boundary events and sequence flows) without introducing new tasks, keeping the process compliant with the SLA requirement.
