It is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity “Approve Invoice.” The reason is that the event-log stub provided in Artefact A contains only the header structure with no data, meaning the essential timestamp values (start_time and complete_time) required to calculate the specific duration of this activity are missing. Artefact B provides only a general aggregate duration metric for the process from “Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice,” which is insufficient for determining the exact cycle time of the individual activity.
