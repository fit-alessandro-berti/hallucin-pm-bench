Subject: Critical SLA Breaches in Loan Processing

Data reveals three activities jointly failing Target_SLA[s] thresholds while exhibiting disproportionately high Avg_Waiting_Time[s] across the process. Legal Approval exceeds SLA by 300s, recording 900s Avg_Throughput_Time[s] against a 600s target, alongside 600s waiting. Risk Review similarly exceeds SLA by 300s, with 600s Avg_Throughput_Time[s] against a 300s target and 480s waiting. Credit Assessment exceeds SLA by 60s, showing 300s Avg_Throughput_Time[s] against a 240s target and 200s waiting. These bottlenecks constrain the final 455 funded Cases compared to 1200 Receive Application Cases.

*   Reduce Legal Approval Avg_Throughput_Time[s] from 900s to meet the 600s Target_SLA[s].
*   Decrease Risk Review Avg_Waiting_Time[s] from 480s to align with the 300s Target_SLA[s].
*   Optimize Credit Assessment Avg_Throughput_Time[s] from 300s to satisfy the 240s Target_SLA[s].

Addressing these gaps is required to meet SLA targets.
