**MEMO: Q1-2025 Claims Handling â€” Key Performance Issues & Recommendations**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Top Three Claims Handling Bottlenecks & Targeted Improvements

Based on Q1-2025 metrics, the three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Request_Documents**  
   - *Why*: Highest average wait time (150 min), exceptionally high rework rate (22.0%), and a significant SLA breach rate (5.5%). Throughput drops sharply here (190 vs. 270 in previous steps), indicating a major bottleneck.
   - *Recommendation*: Introduce automated document-request workflows and customer reminders to reduce wait time and minimize rework.

2. **Review_Documents**  
   - *Why*: High wait time (30 min), very long and variable processing time (25 min, stdev 9 min), and notable SLA breaches (12.4%). Elevated rework rate (5.3%) suggests quality issues.
   - *Recommendation*: Implement targeted staff training or checklists, and consider a sampling review of rejected submissions to identify common errors.

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - *Why*: Processes almost all cases, has a notable waiting period (18 min), moderate processing variability (12 min, stdev 4 min), and a non-trivial SLA breach rate (3.2%), indicating a significant early-stage pinch point.
   - *Recommendation*: Review resource allocation and explore triage protocols to prioritize straightforward cases and reduce backlogs.
