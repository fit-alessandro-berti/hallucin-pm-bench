Yes – you can fire T5 before ever firing T3.  For example:

  1. Start at M₀ = [p0=1, p1..p6=0].  
  2. Fire T1:  
     M₁ = [p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, p3..p6=0].  
  3. Fire T2:  
     M₂ = [p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4..p6=0].  
     (Now p3=1 and p4=0 so T5’s inhibitor‐condition is satisfied.)  
  4. Fire T5:  
     M₃ = [p2=1, p3=0, p6=1, p4=0, p5=0].  

At no point did we fire T3, yet T5 fired legally because p3 had a token and p4 was empty.
