**3.** A low-support activity like "Manual_Fraud_Check" misleads performance and predictive analyses because its rarity makes averages, metrics, and patterns unreliable indicators for the broader process. For instance, performance metrics derived from a single data point can skew resource allocation or fraud detection timings. Predictive models may struggle to learn from infrequent events, leading to high bias and poor accuracy for most cases. Generalizing from this limited occurrence oversimplifies process behavior, resulting in flawed decision-making, such as unnecessary manual checks or misestimating process efficiency. (79 words)
