Subject: Performance Concerns in Loan Processing Workflow

To: COO, Orion Credit  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Date: [Current Date]

Our performance review (see table below) flags three activities requiring urgent attention: Credit Assessment, Legal Approval, and Risk Review. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240[s] SLA by 60[s] (currently 300[s]) and shows high average waiting time (200[s]). Legal Approval misses its 600[s] SLA by 300[s] with waiting time at 600[s]. Lastly, Risk Review surpasses its 300[s] SLA by 300[s] and records waiting time of 480[s]. These issues combine SLA failures and significant waiting time, underscoring critical bottlenecks.

Recommendations:
• For Credit Assessment: Increase automated scoring triggers by 15% to reduce manual assessment frequency.  
• For Legal Approval: Implement parallel approval routing using 2 additional legal officers to cut cycle time by an estimated 200[s].  
• For Risk Review: Reassign 5 high-volume staff to enable batch processing; this could reduce Risk Review’s averaging waiting time by approximately 180[s].

Please let me know if further analysis is needed.
