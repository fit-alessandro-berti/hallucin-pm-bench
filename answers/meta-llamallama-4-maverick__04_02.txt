To analyze case #47291 for compliance with the given rules, let's first summarize the event trace and then check each rule.

1. Create_PO (amount = €12,450, expedited = true, hazardous = false) on 2025-03-03 09:12
2. Manager_Approval on 2025-03-03 11:05
3. Finance_Approval on 2025-03-04 08:17
4. Change_Request on 2025-03-04 15:42
5. Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 10:26
6. Receive_Goods on 2025-03-07 14:13
7. Pay_Invoice on 2025-03-06 09:00
8. Manager_Approval (new) on 2025-03-07 15:10
9. Store_Goods on 2025-03-07 16:02
10. Archive_Record on 2025-03-07 16:20

**Analysis:**

- **R1:** The total amount is €12,450 (> €10,000), and it has Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval. **Compliant**, required approvals are in order.

- **R2:** Expedited = true, and the last required approval (Finance_Approval) was on 2025-03-04 08:17. Ship_Goods occurred on 2025-03-05 10:26, which is within 2 calendar days. **Compliant**, shipped within 2 days.

- **R3:** Pay_Invoice occurred on 2025-03-06 09:00, and Receive_Goods occurred on 2025-03-07 14:13. Pay_Invoice happened before Receive_Goods. **Violated**, invoice paid before receiving goods.

- **R4:** Hazardous = false, so Safety_Inspection is not required. **Not Applicable**, not hazardous goods.

- **R5:** A Change_Request occurred after approvals, and a new Manager_Approval was obtained before further processing. **Compliant**, new approval obtained after change request.

- **R6:** The case terminates with Archive_Record. **Compliant**, case ended with record archiving.

**Overall Result:**
Since one of the rules (R3) is violated, the overall result is **NON-COMPLIANT**.
