No

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1:** Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occur, and in that order (QE before RA). **Rule 1 is satisfied.**

- **Rule 2:** Since severity = "High," `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must occur **after** both QE and RA. In the trace, VP appears after Notify_Authorities. Notably, Notify_Authorities occurs **before** VP, which violates this rule.

- **Rule 3:** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until after QE and RA are complete. Here, NA occurs **before** VP and immediately after QE, which violates this rule.

- **Rule 4:** `Close_Case` (CC) can only occur **after** NA (and VP if required). CC occurs at the end, but since NA occurs before VP and violates rules, the overall compliance is compromised, though CC itself is after NA, itâ€™s moot because earlier rules are violated.

**Conclusion:** The trace violates rules 2 and 3, making it non-compliant.
