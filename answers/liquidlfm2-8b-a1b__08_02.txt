No, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.  
T3 requires P2, but P2’s token is initially in P0 (holding T1). T2 and T7 advance P1 → P3, but P2 remains in P0 until T3 or later. T5 needs P2,3 to fire—but P2 stays inert until processed by T3. Since P2 fires only in T3 or later, T5 (relying on P2,3) cannot precede T3. Thus, T5 fires only after or simultaneously with T3. Minimal firing sequence: T3, T5.
