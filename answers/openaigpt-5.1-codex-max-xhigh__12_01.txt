No. In case 1001, “Update_Inventory” occurs before “Authorize_Refund”, so “Authorize_Refund” is not immediately preceding it. In case 1002 there is no “Update_Inventory” at all. In case 1003, “Update_Inventory” also comes before “Authorize_Refund.” The log shows no instance where “Authorize_Refund” immediately precedes “Update_Inventory.”
