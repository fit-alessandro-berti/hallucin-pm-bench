No

The FACT is not accurate with respect to the event-log excerpt. While "Validate_Payment" immediately follows "Receive_Order" in some cases, it does not do so in all cases, violating the "always" condition.

- For CaseID C001, "Validate_Payment" does immediately follow "Receive_Order" (sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items).
- For CaseID C003, "Validate_Payment" also immediately follows "Receive_Order" (sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order).
- However, for CaseID C002, "Validate_Payment" does not immediately follow "Receive_Order"; instead, "Pack_Items" intervenes (sequence: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment).
- Similarly, for CaseID C004, "Validate_Payment" does not immediately follow "Receive_Order"; "Check_Fraud" intervenes (sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items).

Thus, the FACT is contradicted by the sequences in CaseIDs C002 and C004.
