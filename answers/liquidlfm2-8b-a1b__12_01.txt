The fact is inaccurate. In case 1001 (1001–1005), “Refund_Issued” follows “Authorize_Refund,” not “Update_Inventory.” In case 1002, “Refund_Issued” also follows immediately after “Authorize_Refund,” but in both cases, “Update_Inventory” immediately precedes “Authorize_Refund,” not the other way around. Since **Authorize_Refund** never occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory” in any case, the stated fact does not hold. The observed sequence is:  
- Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → **Authorize_Refund** → **Update_Inventory** → Refund_Issued  
Not: Authorize_Refund → Update_Inventory.  
Thus, the claim is not supported by the log data.
