No

In case **C003**, *Validate_Payment* occurs **before** *Receive_Order* (line **6** precedes line **7**), contradicting the claim that it always follows. Additionally, case **C005** contains *Validate_Payment* (line **11**) but has **no** *Receive_Order* event at all in the fragment, so *Validate_Payment* cannot be said to follow it there either.
