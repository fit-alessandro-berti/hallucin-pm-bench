No – the claim is **not** supported by the fragment.

* **Case 1001**:  
  - Sequence: ... Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued.  
  - Here *Authorize_Refund* comes **after** *Update_Inventory*, not immediately before it.

* **Case 1003**:  
  - Sequence: ... Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund.  
  - Even though *Update_Inventory* precedes *Authorize_Refund*, they are **not adjacent** (an intervening *Quality_Check* breaks “immediately before”).

Since the data show instances where *Authorize_Refund* does not immediately precede *Update_Inventory*, the fact is incorrect.
