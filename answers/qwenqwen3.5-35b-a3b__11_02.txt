**Subject:** Q1 Claims Handling: Critical Bottlenecks

Data identifies three activities requiring immediate intervention:

1. **Request_Documents**: 150-min average wait and 22.0% rework rate. This delay cascades downstream.
*Action:* Launch automated intake portal to minimize manual back-and-forth.

2. **Review_Documents**: 12.4% SLA breach and 25-min processing time (highest). High variance (stdev 9) indicates inconsistent workload.
*Action:* Deploy automated document parsing to reduce manual review time for standard cases.

3. **Initial_Assessment**: 18-min wait and 3.2% SLA breach. Performance lags significantly versus `Pay_Claim` (0.3% breach).
*Action:* Implement parallel processing with `Check_Coverage` to eliminate sequential dependency.

Targeting these metrics will reduce overall cycle time and breach rates.
