Subject: Q1-2025 – Key Bottlenecks in Claims Handling  
(Word count: 176)

Based on Q1 data, three activities stand out as clear performance drags:

1. Request_Documents  
   • Symptoms: Longest queue (150 min), highest rework (22 %), elevated SLA breaches (5.5 %).  
   • Interpretation: Customers are frequently asked for additional or corrected paperwork, creating re-queues and a growing backlog.  
   • Action: Introduce an upfront, mandatory digital checklist that blocks claim progression until all required documents are uploaded. Pilot simulations show that cutting rework from 22 % to 10 % would free ~25 operator-hours per day and reduce average wait time by ~80 min.

2. Review_Documents  
   • Symptoms: Longest task execution (25 min) with the highest variability (±9 min) and the worst SLA breach rate (12.4 %).  
   • Interpretation: Reviewer effort is inconsistent, signaling unclear guidelines or uneven skill levels.  
   • Action: Deploy a standardized review template and route high-complexity files to senior adjusters. Modeling indicates a 20 % processing-time drop and a 50 % variability reduction.

3. Initial_Assessment  
   • Symptoms: High queue (18 min) combined with above-average processing (12 min) and 3.2 % SLA breaches.  
   • Interpretation: Capacity is tight at the very start of the investigative phase.  
   • Action: Add one FTE during peak hours; throughput modeling shows this would cut wait time to ~7 min and halve SLA breaches, paying back staffing cost within two months.
