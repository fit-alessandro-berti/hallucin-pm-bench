Answer 1: Yes.

Reason: T5 needs tokens in P2 and P5. You can obtain P2 from the initial split (T1) and, without firing T3, build P5 via T2 → T7 → T4 (using P3 and P4). Then P2 and P5 coexist, allowing T5 to fire before T3.

Answer 2: Yes.
Minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5
Explanation: T1 creates P2; T2 creates P3; T7 creates P4; T4 creates P5; now P2 and P5 are present, so T5 can fire before T3 (and you haven’t fired T3 yet).
