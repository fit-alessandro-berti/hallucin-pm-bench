1️⃣ The **exact** activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **once** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ This small snippet (3 cases) may mislead because:
- It’s a tiny, non-random sample (only 3 of potentially thousands of cases).
- Case 1002 is the **only** one with a manual fraud check here, but the full log could show different patterns (e.g., more manual checks for high-risk applications).
- The excerpt lacks context (e.g., time trends, case volumes, or triggers for manual reviews).
- Activity names vary slightly (e.g., "Fraud Check (Automatic)" vs. "Automatic Fraud Check"), risking misclassification if not normalized.
