**Subject:** Top Waiting-Time Culprits – Action Plan  
**Date:** [Current Date]  

Analysis of 12-month process data identifies three activities with the highest waiting times:  

1. **Send_Closure_Letter** – Avg: 12.2 h, 95p: 44.0 h  
   *Action:* Automate letter generation and routing via workflow engine to reduce manual handoffs.  

2. **Request_Documents** – Avg: 36.5 h, 95p: 120.0 h  
   *Action:* Deploy real-time document request portal with automated reminders and status tracking.  

3. **Assess_Liability** – Avg: 7.8 h, 95p: 16.4 h  
   *Action:* Implement AI triage to prioritize high-complexity cases and assign resources dynamically.  

Targeted interventions should cut each activity’s waiting time by ≥20 %, boosting customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
