Of course. As an expert on Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process, here is the requested information.

***

**a) Summary of Decision Points**

*   **Conditional Underwriting:** A loan application bypasses the Manual-Underwriting-Review if its risk is Low or Medium and the requested amount is €250,000 or less.
*   **Decision-Gate “TriVote”:** The application is approved to proceed if it receives at least two "approve" decisions from the three required officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer).
*   **Applicant Confirmation:** The process moves to the final step only if the applicant formally accepts the offer by returning the signed documents.

**b) List of Required Documents**

Here are all the documents explicitly required by the process, listed in the order they first appear:

1.  **Form 14B** (Application form)
2.  **Deck Memo** (Generated during Manual Underwriting, if applicable)
3.  **Offer Sheet 77** (The binding offer document)
4.  **ID Matrix Declaration** (Submitted by the applicant with their confirmation)
5.  **Loan Dossier 2025** (The final compiled agreement file)
