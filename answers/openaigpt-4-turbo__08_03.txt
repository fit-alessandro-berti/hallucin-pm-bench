To determine whether transition T5 can fire before T3, let's examine the conditions required for each transition to fire and their relations according to the Petri-net provided:

**Initial Marking:**
- \( p0 = 1 \)
- \( pa = pb = pc = pd = pe = pf = 0 \)

**Transitions and their conditions:**
- \( T1 \ (p0 \rightarrow pa, pb) \) – Can fire directly from the initial marking because \( p0 = 1 \).
- \( T2 \ (pa \rightarrow pc) \) – Requires \( pa = 1 \).
- \( T2b \ (pa \rightarrow pd) \) – Also requires \( pa = 1 \). This transition acts as a shortcut avoiding pc.
- \( T3 \ (pc \rightarrow pd) \) – Requires \( pc = 1 \) and results in \( pd = 1 \).
- \( T4 \ (pb \rightarrow pe) \) – Requires \( pb = 1 \).
- \( T5 \ (pd, pe \rightarrow pf) \) – Requires both \( pd = 1 \) and \( pe = 1 \) to fire.
- \( T6 \ (pf \rightarrow pc) \) – Brings a token back to \( pc \).

**Analysis:**
1. From the initial marking, fire \( T1 \) to distribute tokens to \( pa \) and \( pb \): \( T1: p0 = 0; pa = pb = 1 \).
2. Now, to check if \( T5 \) can fire before \( T3 \), we explore if \( pd \) and \( pe \) can have tokens without firing \( T3 \). Using transition \( T2b \):
   - Fire \( T2b \): \( pa = 0; pd = 1 \) (Token moved to \( pd \) bypassing \( pc \)).
3. Next, fire \( T4 \) since \( pb \) still contains a token:
   - Fire \( T4 \): \( pb = 0; pe = 1 \).
4. At this state (\( pd = 1 \) and \( pe = 1 \)), both prerequisites for \( T5 \) are fulfilled, and \( T3 \) has not yet fired:
   - Fire \( T5 \): \( pd = 0; pe = 0; pf = 1 \).

*Conclusion:* \( T5 \) has fired successfully before \( T3 \) due to the presence of the shortcut transition \( T2b \) allowing \( pd \) to receive a token without going through \( pc \). Therefore, it is possible for \( T5 \) to fire before \( T3 \) in a reachable marking.

**Shortest Firing Sequence where \( T5 \) fires before \( T3 \):**
- \( T1 \rightarrow T2b \rightarrow T4 \rightarrow T5 \)

Thus, the formal firing sequence that enables \( T5 \) to fire prior to \( T3 \) is evidenced above, showing the logical sequence of transitions based strictly on the rules defined by the net and the initial marking.
