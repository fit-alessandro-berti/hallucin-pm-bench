1️⃣ **1** time (only in CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ This snippet shows just 3 cases over ~1.5 hours on one day, with only 1 manual fraud check (33% of cases). An analyst might extrapolate this high rate to the full month-long log, ignoring that later cases, peak volumes, fraud patterns, or incomplete traces (e.g., cases without fraud checks) could skew representation. Snippet lacks volume, duration coverage, and completion status for accurate frequency estimation. (68 words)
