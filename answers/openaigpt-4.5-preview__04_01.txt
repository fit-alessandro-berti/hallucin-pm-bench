Non-compliant  
Justification:  
1. Compliant: Approval of PO above â‚¬10,000 is correctly performed first by "Procurement_Officer" (event #2) and then by "CFO" (event #3) before issuing the PO (event #5). (Rule 1 satisfied)  
2. Non-compliant: Trace contains "Expedite_Flag" (event #4), thus requiring "Risk_Assessment" to occur before "Ship_Goods". However, "Risk_Assessment" (event #9) occurs after "Ship_Goods" (event #8). (Violation of Rule 2)  
3. Compliant: "Three_way_match" (event #10) occurs exactly two activities after "Goods_Received" (event #6), satisfying the activity-distance constraint. (Rule 3 satisfied)  
4. Compliant: No activity executed by "Intern" (event #7) directly follows a "CFO" activity (event #3 and #4 separate this clearly), thus respecting this constraint. (Rule 4 satisfied)  
5. Compliant: Trace ends with "Archive_Record" (event #11), without any further activities. (Rule 5 satisfied)

The violation of Rule 2 makes the entire trace non-compliant.
