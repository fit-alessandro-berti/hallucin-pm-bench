**SUBJECT:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Critical Bottlenecks  

Three activities exhibit severe performance degradation, driving system-wide delays:  

1. **Review_Documents**:  
   - **Why**: Highest *avg_processing_time_min* (25 mins) and *stdev* (9 mins)—indicating inconsistent, complex reviews—coupled with the worst *sla_breach_pct* (12.4%) and elevated rework (5.3%).  
   - **Action**: Standardize review checklists to reduce processing time/variability; target 20% reduction via template adoption.  

2. **Request_Documents**:  
   - **Why**: Extremely high *rework_rate_pct* (22.0%)—22× the workflow average—implies systemic document rejection, directly causing the longest *avg_wait_time_min* (150 mins).  
   - **Action**: Implement automated pre-submission format validation to cut rework; monitor rework rate weekly.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**:  
   - **Why**: Disproportionate *avg_wait_time_min* (18 mins) despite moderate processing time (12 mins), indicating upstream Register_Claim throughput mismatch (280 vs. 270). SLA breach (3.2%) confirms flow strain.  
   - **Action**: Rebalance Register_Claim/Initial_Assessment staff ratios to align throughput (280 → 270); measure wait time impact in 30 days.  

These actions target quantifiable root causes (rework, wait time, throughput gaps) with immediate ROI. No other activities breach critical thresholds.
