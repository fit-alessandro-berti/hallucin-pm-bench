Let me evaluate the trace step by step against the recall-handling rules:

1. **Rule 1**: Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` must occur exactly once, in that order.
   - The trace shows both events in sequence: `Quality_Engineer_Review` before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
   - **Satisfied**.

2. **Rule 2**: If `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` must happen **after** both `QE` and `RA`.
   - The case has `severity = "High"`.
   - `QE` and `RA` occur before `VP_Safety_Approval`.
   - **Violated** because VP happens before QE and RA.

3. **Rule 3**: `Notify_Authorities` must not occur until after `QE` and `RA` are complete.
   - `NA` occurs after both `QE` and `RA`.
   - **Satisfied**.

4. **Rule 4**: `Close_Case` can only occur after `NA` (and if required by rule 2, after VP).
   - `NA` has already occurred.
   - The trace ends with `Close_Case`.
   - Since there is no VP due to the violation of rule 2, this is **not** fully satisfied.

Given these findings, the trace does not fully comply with ruleset R.

**Final Answer**: No. The trace violates Rule 2 because VP approval occurs before Quality and Regulatory reviews, violating the required wait order. There's also an unresolved issue with Rule 4 regarding the order of Close_Case.
