The three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:  

1. **Request_Documents**: Avg 36.5h (95th %ile: 120.0h) – Implement automated document reminders and digital checklist prompts upon claim submission to reduce follow-up delays.  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg 12.2h (95th %ile: 44.0h) – Integrate auto-triggered letter generation upon payment approval or claim rejection to eliminate manual routing.  
3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg 7.8h (95th %ile: 16.4h) – Deploy AI-assisted case routing to senior adjusters based on claim complexity to reduce idle queue time.  

Each action targets ≥20% waiting-time reduction through automation and intelligent workflow design. Immediate piloting recommended.
