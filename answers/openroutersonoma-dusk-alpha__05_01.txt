To ensure the SLA is met without adding tasks, introduce a timer intermediate event after the "Receive Claim" task (Task_Receive) to enforce the 48-hour deadline for reaching "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage). Set the timer duration to PT48H (48 hours from claim submission). Connect the timer event to an existing exclusive gateway that can trigger auto-escalation via a conditional sequence flow (e.g., modify GW_Docs or add a new gateway using existing elements). This catches delays from the loop back to Task_Triage and escalates overdue claims automatically.
