To meet the SLA without adding tasks, **add a timer event** on the “Receive Claim” start event (Start_Claim) that triggers an exclusive gateway (GW_Docs) after 48 hours if no “Check Completeness” (Task_Check) occurs. This forces early triage or escalation, ensuring compliance. Use the existing GW_Docs and Task_Check IDs; configure a timer event on Start_Claim referencing Task_Check as the next step if timeout occurs. This leverages existing elements, enforces the SLA, and avoids new activities.
