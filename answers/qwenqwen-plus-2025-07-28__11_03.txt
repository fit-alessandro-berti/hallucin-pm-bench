Three activities are severely underperforming due to SLA breaches and high waiting times. Risk Review averages 600 seconds, exceeding its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with waiting time at 480 seconds. Legal Approval averages 900 seconds—300 seconds over its 600-second SLA—with 600 seconds spent waiting. Credit Assessment averages 300 seconds, surpassing its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, and has the highest waiting time of 200 seconds among non-bottlenecked activities. These delays affect downstream flow and customer experience.

- Allocate additional trained underwriters to reduce queue time in Credit Assessment  
- Implement shift overlap during peak hours to maintain Legal Approval throughput and cut waiting time  
- Introduce automated document validation before Risk Review to reduce processing and waiting times
