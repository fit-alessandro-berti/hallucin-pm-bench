1. **Manual_Fraud_Check** occurs **1 time**.  
2. a) **2.08%** of all events (1/48 = 0.0208).  
   b) **8.33%** of all cases (1/12 ≈ 0.0833).  
3. **Explanation**: Manual_Fraud_Check is rare (1/48 events), making it an outlier. If generalized from this slice, models might underweight its importance, leading to poor performance in contexts where it matters (e.g., fraud detection). Rare events can skew metrics or create biases if ignored, causing analysts to overlook critical but infrequent patterns.
