Yes. \(T_5\) is only inhibited by a token in \(p_4\); if you postpone \(T_3\) then \(p_4\) stays empty. One possible run from the initial marking is
\[
M_0\xrightarrow{T_1}M_1\xrightarrow{T_2}M_2\xrightarrow{T_5}M_3\xrightarrow{T_3}M_4,
\]
where:

- After \(T_1\): \(p_1=1,p_2=1\).
- After \(T_2\): \(p_3=1,p_2=1,p_4=0\), so \(T_5\) is enabled.
- Fire \(T_5\) to consume \(p_3\) (with \(p_4\) still empty) and produce \(p_6\).
- Only then fire \(T_3\) to move the \(p_2\) token to \(p_4\).

In this sequence \(T_5\) fires before \(T_3\), as required.
