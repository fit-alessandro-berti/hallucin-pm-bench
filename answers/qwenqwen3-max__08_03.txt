Yes.

**Shortest firing sequence**:  
`T1, T2b, T4, T5`

### Explanation:
- Start at initial marking: `p0=1`, others 0.
- Fire **T1**: consumes p0 → produces pa, pb → marking: `pa=1, pb=1`
- Fire **T2b**: consumes pa → produces pd → marking: `pb=1, pd=1`
- Fire **T4**: consumes pb → produces pe → marking: `pd=1, pe=1`
- Now **T5** is enabled (pd and pe both marked) → fire it: consumes pd, pe → produces pf

At this point, **T5** has fired, and **T3** has *never* fired — nor could it have, because **T3** requires `pc` to be marked, which never happened in this sequence. T2b was chosen instead of T2, bypassing pc entirely.

Thus, T5 can fire before T3 — in fact, without T3 ever firing at all.

✅ **Answer: Yes — shortest sequence: `T1, T2b, T4, T5`**
