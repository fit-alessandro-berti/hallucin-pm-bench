Yes, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3**.

### Shortest firing sequence:
**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

### Step‑by‑step justification:

- **Initial marking**: `p0 = 1`, all other places empty.

1. **Fire T1**:  
   - Consumes 1 token from `p0`.  
   - Produces 1 token in `pa` and 1 token in `pb`.  
   - **Marking**: `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`.

2. **Fire T2b**:  
   - Consumes 1 token from `pa`.  
   - Produces 1 token in `pd`.  
   - **Marking**: `pb = 1`, `pd = 1`.

3. **Fire T4**:  
   - Consumes 1 token from `pb`.  
   - Produces 1 token in `pe`.  
   - **Marking**: `pd = 1`, `pe = 1`.

4. **Fire T5**:  
   - Consumes 1 token from `pd` and 1 from `pe`.  
   - Produces 1 token in `pf`.  
   - **Marking**: `pf = 1`.

At this point **T5 has fired**, and **T3 has not fired yet** (in fact, `pc` has never received a token, so T3 is not even enabled). Thus, T5 can indeed fire before T3.

This sequence is of length 4 and is the shortest possible, because:
- T5 requires tokens in both `pd` and `pe`.
- `pe` can only be produced by T4, which requires a token in `pb`.
- `pb` is only produced by T1.
- `pd` can be produced either by T2b (directly from `pa`) or by T3 (via `pc`).
- To avoid firing T3, we must produce `pd` via T2b.
- Hence the minimal chain is: T1 (to get `pa`, `pb`) → T2b (to get `pd`) → T4 (to get `pe`) → T5.

Therefore, the answer is **yes**, with the shortest firing sequence **T1, T2b, T4, T5**.
