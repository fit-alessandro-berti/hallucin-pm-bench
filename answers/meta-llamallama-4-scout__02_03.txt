Here are the answers to the questions:

* **1.** There are 3 distinct cases: C123, C456, C789.
* **2.** The activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" for case "C456" is "Pack_Items".
* **3.** The activities that appear exactly once in the entire fragment are: 
  - Cancel_Order 
  - Create_Order (for case C789) is one of them but Create_Order also appears for C123 and C456, 
  - However,  "Cancel_Order" and also "Validate_Order" for C456 and C123 respectively do appear and "Pack_items", "Ship_order" and "Validate_order" , "Create_order"  appears more than once 
    So "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once.
