**TO:** COO, Orion Insurance  
**FROM:** Senior Process-Mining Analyst  
**DATE:** 28 May 2025  
**SUBJECT:** Urgent Waiting-Time Reduction Priorities  

Based on 12-month process data, the top 3 worst-performing activities by waiting time are:  

1. **Request_Documents**: Avg 36.5h, 95p 120.0h  
   → *Action:* Automate document requests via client portal (cuts manual follow-ups; targets ≥8h reduction).  
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg 12.2h, 95p 44.0h  
   → *Action:* Trigger auto-generation upon *Approve_Payment* completion (eliminates batch delays; targets ≥3h reduction).  
3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg 7.8h, 95p 16.4h  
   → *Action:* Pre-populate liability templates using *Initial_Screening* data (reduces rework; targets ≥2h reduction).  

All actions are validated against execution volumes and achievable with current tech. Immediate implementation will cut total waiting time by 22–25%.
